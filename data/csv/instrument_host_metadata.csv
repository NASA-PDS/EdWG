In 1978, ESA was invited by NASA to plan a joint mission       consisting of a comet Halley fly-by in November 1985 and a       rendezvous with comet Tempel 2 in 1988.  The mission comprised an       American main spacecraft which would carry a European probe. The       main spacecraft, with its array of sophisticated cameras and       experiments, would complete a fly-by of comet Halley at a safe       distance.  Shortly before fly-by, the probe would be released       towards the nucleus to make detailed in-situ observations in the       innermost coma.  In January 1980, however, it became clear that       financial support for the Halley Fly-by/Tempel 2 Rendezvous       mission could not be secured in the USA.  By that time the       interest of European scientists had built up such momentum that       ESA considered the possibility of a purely European mission.  The       support for a fly-by mission was strong in Europe and went far       beyond the small section of scientists specialised in cometary       research.  A fly-by of comet Halley was suggested to ESA by the       scientific community in February 1980.  Rather than having the       American spacecraft deliver the probe to the comet as in the       earlier concept, the Europeans proposed that the capabilities of       the small probe be increased by building an independent, self-       sufficient spacecraft to be launched using the European Ariane       rocket.  The limited time available for development and the small       financial resources made it advisable to use a spin-stabilised       spacecraft derived from the European Earth orbiting spacecraft       Geos.  This proposal was studied by ESA in the first half of 1980.         Details of the selected experiments are shown in the Table below.       The Giotto spacecraft carried 10 instruments to carry out the       scientific objectives. In addition, it was intended to extract       from the radio signal information on the columnar electron content       of comet Halley's ionosphere and the mass fluence of the cometary       atmosphere.  The mass and power allocations to the Halley       Multicolour Camera (HMC) were similar to those of several other       experiments.  Half of the total data transmission rate of 40       kbit/s was allocated to HMC.         The spin of the spacecraft had some advantages.  The stability of       the orientation (attitude) of the spacecraft was based on its       angular momentum and was not so sensitive to the inevitable       impacts by dust grains.  This concept is also more compact than a       three-axis stabilised spacecraft (such as the Vega and Voyager       spacecraft) and, therefore, it was easier to protect the       spacecraft.  The high fly-by velocity caused by the combination of       the retrograde orbit of comet Halley and the direct orbit of the       Giotto spacecraft was almost 100 times higher than the speed of       material leaving the cometary nucleus.  This implied that the       velocity of the dust and gas relative to the spacecraft would       hardly change during the fly-by.  The experiments measuring       cometary species in-situ only had to look in the forward (ram)       direction along which the symmetry (spin) axis of the spacecraft       was oriented.  Most of the experiments were situated on the       experiment platform near the front end of the spacecraft and       directly behind the dust shield.  The communications link between       the spacecraft and Earth was supported by a despun high gain dish       antenna which was kept pointing towards Earth throughout the       mission.  The angle (135.7 degrees) between the antenna beam and       the spin axis of the spacecraft was determined by the geometry of       the fly-by and was fixed during the mission design phase.         A unique feature of the Giotto spacecraft was its dust shield       which was used to protect Giotto from the high velocity dust       particle impacts.  A 1mm thick plate of aluminium was mounted 23cm       in front of the main body of the spacecraft and covered the full       cross-section of the cylindrical body.  Particles of mass >10**-6       g that penetrated this aluminium plate disintegrated and       vaporised.  A cloud of vapour (neutral and ionised gas) then hit       the thick rear shield (made mostly of Kevlar) with a much larger       cross-section than the original particle, thereby reducing the       pressure.         Only masses >/= 1 g were expected to penetrate the Kevlar shield.       However, it had been calculated that smaller dust particles could       already perturb the spacecraft attitude so severely that the       communications link to Earth could be lost.  The most realistic       dust models led to the prediction that the probability of such an       attitude perturbation was considerably higher than that of       spacecraft destruction.         Summary of Giotto experiments, as well as the Radio Science       Experiment:           HMC         ---           The Halley Multicolor Camera is a CCD narrow-angle camera used           for imaging the inner coma and nucleus with high resolution           (11m at a close approach of 500 km).  The camera baffle was           eroded during the encounter and the camera is no longer           operational.  The HMC successfully imaged the nucleus up to 10           s before closest approach.           NMS         ---           Neutral Mass Spectrometer consists of a mass analyzer and           energy analyzer that seeks to determine the neutral gas           composition.  Both CCDs of the detectors ceased operation           during the dust episode that disabled the HMC.           IMS/HIS         -------           The Ion Mass Spectrometer has two sensors optimized to           different parts of the coma.  For the inner coma, the HIS           (High Intensity Spectrometer) measures the relative abundance           of ions in the energy range 300 to 1400 eV/e.  This instrument           remains functional.          IMS/HERS        --------           The Ion Mass Spectrometer sensor optimized for the outer coma           is called HERS (High Energy Range Spectrometer).  It measures           the relative abundance of ions from 10 eV/e to 2.0 (or 4.5)           keV/e depending on the M/Q ratio.  There was high voltage           damage to this isntrument and it is no longer useable.          PIA        ---           The Particle Imapct Analyzer measures dust particle flux and           composition between 1-110 AMU.  Although the instrument           recevied no damage in the encounter, it was turned off.           DID/MSM         -------           The Dust Impact Detector is used to determine the dust           particle flux and mass distribution.  It consists of three           sensors one of which is the meteroid shield momentum sensor           (MSM) that can be used to sample a large or small shield           sector. No damage was sustained during encounter.          DID/RSM        -------           A similar type of DID measurement to determine dust particle           flux and mass distribution is possible by using the rear           momentum shield (RSM). No damage to this sensor was detected           post encounter.           DID/CIS         -------           The second type of sensor used in DID is the capacitor impact           sensor (CIS) which is sensitive to particles in the 1-5 micron           range.  The sensor is still operational.           DID/IPM         -------           The final type of DID sensor is for impact plasma and momentum           (IPM) determination of the dust particle flux and mass           distribution.  The sensor consists of either an impact           ionization detector (IPM-P) or a piezoelectric detector (IPM-           M). This instrument shows some anomalous behavior.           JPA/FIS         -------           The Johnstone Particle Analyzer measures the 3-dimesnional           velocity distribution of positive ions near the comet.  The           Fast Ion Sensor (FIS) ristricts the energy range to 10 eV/q to           20 KeV/q for all directions, once every rotation of the           spacecraft.  The high voltage to this sensor stopped working           1.5 hours from encounter.           JPA/IIS         -------           The JPA also consists of an Implanted Ion Sensor (IIS) which           measures the energy per charge distribution from 90 eV/q to 90           KeV/q with discrimination into five mass groups.  No damage to           this instrument was detected post encounter.           RPA/EESA         --------           The RPA-Copernic plasma experiment for the Giotto mission           seeks to measure the 3-dimensional distributions of electrons           and thermal positive ions near the comet.  The spectrometer           sensor (EESA) measures both the flux and energy spectra of           electrons from 10 eV to 30 KeV in 4 pi directions.  Some           damage to the sensor was detected post encounter.           RPA/PICCA         ---------           In the plasma experiment, the electrostatic mass analyzer           (PICCA) is designed to measure the thermal positive ions in           the mass range 10-203 AMU near the comet.  The high voltage           damage sustained by this instrument makes it unuseable.           EPA         ---           The Energetic Particle Analyzer (EPA) determines the flux of           particle with energy greater than 20 KeV, thus including both           electrons and accelerated ions.  This instrument has been           operating in the cruise phase and sustained no damage in the           encounter.           MAG         ---           The Magnetometer consists of a triaxial and separate biaxial           system of fluxgate sensors of the ring-core type.  This           instrument was also switched-on during the cruise phase and           continues to operate flawlessly post encounter.           OPE         ---           The Optical Probe Experiment measures the flux and polarized           brightness in various colors in the direction opposite to the           direction of motion of the spacecraft through the comet's           coma.  This instrument sustained no damage in the encounter.           GRE         ---           The Giotto Radio Experiment takes the measurements of the           phase (Doppler) shifts of the downlink carrier, e.g.  X-band,           as a function of time to infer the total mass content along           the trajectory.  This experiment continues to function.             Launch Date: 1985-07-02          ",,
urn:esa:psa:context:instrument_host:spacecraft.hp,HUYGENS PROBE,HUYGENS PROBE,"       Instrument Host Overview   ========================   [From JONES&GIOVAGNOLI1997]:   The Huygens Probe is the ESA-provided element of the joint NASA/ESA Cassini/Huygens mission to Saturn and Titan, the planet's largest moon. The industrial Phase B activities began in January 1991 under the leadership of Aerospatiale, the Huygens prime contractor.   The Probe was carried to Titan by the Cassini Saturn Orbiter. Huygens was dormant during the interplanetary journey of 6.7 years, although it was activated about every 6 months to verify and monitor its health. It was released 22 days before the Titan encounter. The Probe's aeroshell decelerated it in less than 3 min from the entry speed of about 6 km/s to 400 m/s (Mach 1.5) by 150-180 km altitude. From that point onwards, a pre-programmed sequence triggered parachute deployment and heatshield ejection. The main part of the scientific mission then started, lasting for the whole descent of 2-2.5 h. The Huygens model philosophy was optimised to achieve the most complete verification possible that the Probe system meets the mission requirements within the cost envelope and the tight schedule constraints imposed by the launch window. Four models were developed at system level:   1. Structural, Thermal & Pyro Model (STPM): to qualify the Probe design (including all mechanisms activated by pyrotechnic devices) for all structural, mechanical and thermal requirements;   2. Electrical Model (EM): to verify the electrical performances of the Probe and of the electrical/functional interfaces with the Orbiter;   3. Special Model (SM2): used for the balloon drop test in May 1995. All the mechanisms and the descent control systems were flight-standard;   4. Flight Model (FM).   Overall Configuration ---------------------   The Probe System comprises two principal elements:   1. the 318 kg Huygens Probe, which enters Titan's atmosphere after   separating from the Saturn Orbiter;   2. the 30 kg Probe Support Equipment (PSE), which remains attached to   the Orbiter after Probe separation.     The Probe consists of the Entry Assembly (ENA) cocooning the Descent Module (DM). ENA provides Orbiter attachment, umbilical separation and ejection, cruise and entry thermal protection, and entry deceleration control. It is jettisoned after entry, releasing the Descent Module. The DM comprises an aluminium shell and inner structure containing all the experiments and Probe support subsystems, including the parachute descent and spin control devices.   The PSE consists of:   1. four electronic boxes aboard the Orbiter: two Probe Support   Avionics (PSA), a Receiver Front End (RFE) and a Receiver Ultra   Stable Oscillator (RUSO);   2. the Spin Eject Device (SED);   3. the harness (including the umbilical connector) providing power and   RF and data links between the PSA, Probe and Orbiter.         Front Shield Subsystem (FRSS) -----------------------------   The 79 kg, 2.7 m diameter, 60 degree half-angle coni-spherical Front Shield will decelerate the Probe in Titan's upper atmosphere from about 6 km/s at entry to a velocity equivalent to about Mach 1.5 by around 160 km altitude. Tiles of AQ60 ablative material, a felt of silica fibres reinforced by phenolic resin, provide protection against the 1 MW/m2 thermal flux. The shield is then jettisoned and the Descent Control Subsystem (DCSS) is deployed to control the descent of the DM to the surface. The FRSS supporting structure is a CFRP honeycomb shell which also provides some DM thermal protection during entry. The AQ60 tiles are attached to the CFRP structure by adhesive CAF/730. Prosial, a suspension of hollow silica spheres in silicon elastomer, is sprayed directly on to the aluminium structure of the FRSS rear surfaces, where fluxes are ten times lower.   Back Cover Subsystem (BCSS) ---------------------------   The Back Cover protects the DM during entry, ensures depressurisation during launch and carries multi-layer insulation (MLI) for the cruise and coast phases. As it does not have stringent aerothermodynamic requirements, it is a stiffened aluminium shell of minimal mass (11.4 kg) protected by Prosial (5 kg). It includes: an access door for late integration and forced-air ground cooling of the Probe; a break-out patch through which the first (drogue) parachute is fired; a labyrinth sealing joint with the Front Shield, providing a non-structural thermal and particulate barrier.   Descent Control Subsystem (DCSS) --------------------------------   The DCSS controls the descent rate to satisfy the scientific payload's requirements, and the attitude to meet the requirements of the Probe- Orhbiter RF data link and of the descent camera's image-taking. The DCSS is activated nominally at Mach 1.5 and about 160 km altitude. The sequence begins by firing the Parachute Deployment Device (PDD) to eject the pilot 'chute pack through the Back Cover's break-out patch, the attachment pins of which shear under the impact. The 2.59 m diameter Disk Gap Band (DGB) pilot 'chute inflates 27 m behind the DM and pulls the Back Cover away from the rest of the assembly. As it goes, the Back Cover pulls the 8.30 m diameter DGB main parachute from its container. This canopy inflates during the supersonic phase to decelerate and stabilise the Probe through the transonic region. The Front Shield is released at about Mach 0.6. In fact, the main parachute is sized by the requirement to provide sufficient deceleration to guarantee a positive separation of the Front Shield from the Descent Module. The main parachute is too large for a nominal descent time shorter than 2.5 h, a constraint imposed by battery limitations, so it is jettisoned and a 3.03 m diameter DGB stabilising parachute is deployed. All parachutes are made of Kevlar lines and nylon fabric. The main and stabiliser 'chutes are housed in a single canister on the DM's top platform. Compatibility with the Probe's spin is ensured by incorporating a swivel using redundant low-friction bearings in the connecting riser of both the main and stabiliser 'chutes.   Separation Subsystem (SEPS) ---------------------------   SEPS provides: mechanical and electrical attachment to, and separation from the Orbiter; the transition between the entry configuration ('cocoon') and the descent configuration (DM under parachute). The three SEPS mechanisms are connected on one side to Huygens' Inner Structure (ISTS) and on the other to the Orbiter's supporting struts. As well as being the Probe-Orbiter structural load path, each SEPS fitting incorporates a pyronut for Probe-Orbiter separation, a rod cutter for Front Shield release and a rod cutter for Back Cover release.   Within SEPS, the Spin Eject Device (SED) performs the mechanical separation from the Orbiter:   - three stainless steel springs provide the separation force - three guide devices, each with two axial rollers running along a   T-profile helical track, ensure controlled ejection and spin, even   in degraded cases such as high friction or a weak spring - a carbon fibre ring accommodates the asymmetrical loads from the   Orbiter truss and provides the necessary stiffness before and after   separation - three pyronuts provide the mechanical link before separation.   In addition, the Umbilical Separation Mechanism of three 19-pin connectors, which provide Orbiter-Probe electrical links, is disconnected by the SED.   Inner Structure Subsystem (ISTS) --------------------------------   The ISTS provides mounting support for the Probe's payload and subsystems. It is fully sealed except for a vent hole of about 6 cm2 on the top, and comprises:   - the 73 mm thick aluminium honeycomb sandwich Experiment Platform;   supports the majority of the experiments and subsystems units,   together with their associated harness - the 25 mm thick aluminium honeycomb sandwich Top Platform; supports   the Descent Control Subsystem and Probe RF antennas, and forms the   DM's top external surface - the After Cone and Fore Dome aluminium shells, linked by a central   ring - three radial titanium struts; interface with SEPS and ensure thermal   decoupling, while three vertical titanium struts link the two   platforms and transfer the main parachute deployment loads - 36 spin vanes on the Fore Dome's periphery; provide spin control   during descent - the secondary structure; for mounting experiments and equipment.   Thermal Subsystem (THSS) ------------------------   While the PSE is thermally controlled by the Orbiter, the Probe's THSS must maintain all experiments and subsystem units within their allowed temperature ranges during all mission phases. In space, the THSS partially insulates the Probe from the Orbiter and ensures only small variations in the Probe's internal temperatures, despite the incident solar flux varying from 3800 W/m2 (near Venus) to 17 W/m2 (approaching Titan after 22 days of the coast phase following Orbiter separation). Probe thermal control is achieved by: - MLI surrounding all external areas, except for the small 'thermal   window' of the Front Shield - 35 Radioisotope Heater Units (RHUs) on the Experiment and Top   Platforms continuously providing about 1 W each even when the Probe   is dormant - a white-painted 0.17 m2 thin aluminium sheet on the Front Shield's   forward face acting as a controlled heat leak (about 8 W during   cruise) to reduce sensitivity of thermal performances to MLI   efficiency.   The MLI is burned and torn away during entry, leaving temperature control to the AQ60 high-temperature tiles on the Front Shield's front face, and to Prosial on the Front Shield's aft surface and on the Back Cover. During the descent phase, thermal control is provided by foam insulation and gas-tight seals. Lightweight open-cell Basotect foam covers the internal walls of DM's shells and Top Platform. This prevents convection cooling by Titan's cold atmosphere (70 K at 45 km altitude) and thermally decouples the units mounted on the Experiment Platform from the cold aluminium shells. Gas-tight seals around all elements protruding through the DM's shell minimise gas influx. In fact, the DM is gas tight except for a single 6 cm2 hole in Top Platform that equalises pressure during launch and descent to Titan's surface.   Electrical Power Subsystem (EPSS) =================================   Description -----------   The EPSS consists of:   - Five batteries: Provide mission power from Orbiter separation until   at least 30 min after arrival on Titan's surface. Each battery   comprises two modules of 13 LiSO2 (7.6 Ah) cells in series. - Power Conditioning & Distribution Unit (PCDU): Provides the power   conditioning and distribution to the Probe's equipment and   experiments via a regulated main bus, with protection to ensure   uninterrupted operations even in the event of single failure inside   or outside the PCDU.   During the cruise phase, the Probe is powered by the Orbiter and the   PCDU isolates the batteries. The five interface circuits connected   to the Orbiter's Solid State Power Switches (SSPSs) provide Probe-   Orbiter insulation and voltage adaptation between the SSPS output   and the input of the PCDU's Battery Discharge Regulator (BDR)   circuits. The BDRs condition the power from either the Orbiter or   the batteries and generate the 28 V bus, controlled by a centralised   Main Error Amplifier (MEA). The distribution is performed by active   current limiters, with the current limitation adapted for each user   and with ON/OFF switching capability. The Mission Timer, however, is   supplied by three switchable battery voltage lines through series   fuses or, when the PCDU is powered by the Orbiter, by dedicated   output voltage lines of the Orbiter interface circuits.   The PCDU also provides a protected +5 V supply used by the Pyro unit   to generate the bi-level status telemetry of the selection relays   and for the activation circuit that switches ON the Pyro unit's   energy intercept relay. - Pyro Unit (PYRO): Provides two redundant sets of 13 pyro lines,   directly connected to the centre taps of two batteries (through   protection devices), for activating pyro devices. Safety   requirements are met by three independent levels of control relays   in series in the Pyro Unit, as well as active switches and current   limiters controlling the firing current. The three series relay   levels are: energy intercept relay (activated by PCDU at the end of   the coast phase); arming relays (activated by the arming timer   hardware); selection relays (activated by Command and Data   Management Unit, CDMU, software). In addition, safe/arm plugs are   provided on the unit itself for ground operations.   Operational modes -----------------   - Cruise phase: The EPSS is completely OFF over the whole cruise   phase, except for periodic checkout operations. There is no power at   the Orbiter interface and direct monitoring by the Orbiter allows   verification that all the relays are open. - Cruise phase checkout: The EPSS is powered by the Orbiter for cruise   checkout operations. The 28 V bus is regulated by the EPSS BDRs   associated with each Orbiter SSPS; a total of 210 W is available   from the Orbiter and all the relays are open. - Timer loading: Following the loading (from the Orbiter) of the   correct coast time duration into the Mission Timer Unit, battery   depassivation is performed to overcome any energy loss due to ageing   during cruise. Before Probe separation, the EPSS timer relays are   closed to supply the Mission Timer from the batteries and the   Orbiter power is switched off. - Coast phase: Only the Mission Timer is supplied by batteries through   specific timer relays during the coast phase. The EPSS is OFF and   all other relays are open. - End of coast phase - Probe wake-up: At the end of the coast phase,   the Mission Timer wakes the Probe by activating the EPSS. Input   relays are closed and the current limiters powering the CDMU are   automatically switched ON as soon as the 28 V bus reaches its   nominal value (other current limiters are initially OFF at power   up). The pyro energy intercept relay is also automatically switched   on by a command from the PCDU. - Entry and descent phases: All PCDU relays are closed and the total   power (nominal 300 W, maximum 400 W) is available on the 28 V   distribution outputs to subsystems and equipment. The Pyro Unit   performs the selection and the firing of the squibs, activated by   CDMU commands.   Command & Data Management Subsystems (CDMS) ===========================================   The data handling and processing functions are divided between the Probe Support Equipment (PSE) on the Orbiter and the CDMUs (part of the CDMS) in the Probe. The Probe Data Relay Subsystem (PDRS) provides the RF link function for this purpose, together with the data handling and communication function with the Orbiter's Control and Data Subsystem (CDS) via a Bus Interface Unit (BIU). (During the ground operations and cruise phase checkouts, the Orbiter-Probe RF link is replaced by umbilical connections.) The CDMS has two primary functions: autonomous control of Probe operations after separation; management of data transfer from the equipment, subsystems and experiments to the Probe transmitter for relay to the Orbiter. For these functions, the CDMS uses the Probe On-board Software (POSW), for which it provides the necessary processing, storage and interface capabilities. The driving requirement of the CDMS design is intrinsic single point failure-tolerance. As a result of the highly specific Huygens mission (limited duration and no access by telecommand after separation), a very safe redundancy scheme has been selected. The CDMS comprises: - two identical CDMUs - a triply redundant Mission Timer Unit (MTU) - two mechanical g-switches (backing up MTU) - a triply redundant Central Acceleration Sensor Unit (CASU) - two sets of two mechanical g-switches (backing up CASU) - a Radial Acceleration Sensor Unit (RASU) with two accelerometers - two Radar Altimeter proximity sensors, each comprising separate   electronics, transmit antenna and receive antenna The two CDMUs each execute their own POSW simultaneously and are configured with hot redundancy (Chain A and Chain B). Each hardware chain can run the mission independently. They are identical in almost all respects; the following minor differences facilitate simultaneous operations and capitalise on the redundancy: - telemetry is transmitted at two different RF frequencies - chain B telemetry is delayed by about 6 s to avoid loss of data   should a temporary loss of the telemetry link occur (e.g. from an   antenna misalignment as the Probe oscillates beneath the parachute). Each CDMU chain incorporates a health check (called the Processor Valid status) which is reported to the experiments in the Descent Data Broadcasts (DDBs). A chain declares itself invalid when two bit errors in the same memory word, an ADA exception or an under-voltage on the 5 V line occur within the CDMU.   Command and Data Management Unit (CDMU) ---------------------------------------   Each CDMU includes a MAS 281 16-bit 1750A micro-processor running at 10 MHz, with 64 kword PROM storing the POSW and 64 kword RAM used for the POSW and other dynamic data when the CDMU is on. A Memory Management Unit is implemented to provide memory flexibility and some growth potential. Direct Memory Access (DMA) is provided to facilitate data transfer between the memory and the input/output registers, thus relieving the microprocessor of repetitive input/output tasks. The RAM-stored program memory is protected against single error occurrence by an Error Detection And Correction (EDAC) device, which detects and corrects single bit errors and reports any double bit errors to the Processor Valid function. TM/TC management is based on an internal On-Board Data Handling (OBDH) bus in order to standardise the internal interfaces, which are based on the classical Central Terminal Unit (CTU) and Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) approach. In addition to conventional CDMS functions, the CDMUs implement the following Huygens-specific functions: - the arming timer function sends pyro and arming commands following a   specific hardware-managed timeline, thus offering full decoupling   from the POSW operation - the Processor Valid signal is sent to experiments via the Descent   Data Broadcast (DDB), indicating the health of the nominal CDMU   (unit A) - reprogrammability through the use of 16 kword of Electrically   Erasable PROM (EEPROM), thus allowing patching of the POSW if   necessary - the EDAC error count reports on internal data transfers - the capability, through specific 16 kword of RAM, to delay one   telemetry chain.   Mission Timer Unit (MTU) ------------------------   The MTU is used to activate the Probe at the end of the coast phase. To obtain a single point failure-free design, it is based on three independent hot redundant timer circuits followed by two hot-redundant command circuits. Two mechanical g-switches provide backup. MTU power is supplied directly via three 65 V supply lines, one for each Timer Board, from independent batteries. During the pre-separation programming activities, when the Probe is still connected to the Orbiter, all three Timers are programmed with the exact duration of the coast phase via serial memory load interfaces from one of the two CDMUs. Each of the three Timer Boards can be loaded independently from either CDMU. The programmed values can be verified by the serial telemetry channels. When programming is finished, the CDMUs and all other Probe systems except the MTU are turned off and the Probe is separated. During the coast phase of about 22 days, the programmed Timer register is decremented by a very precise clock signal. The MTU consumes about 300 mW during this period as only the necessary circuits (CMOS-based) are powered. When the Command Board majority voting detects either both g-switches active or at least two of the three 'time-out' signals received, five High Level Commands (HLCs) are issued sequentially from each Board to the PCDU in order to switch on both CDMUs. The timer then returns to a standby mode. The two g-switches, which ensure Probe wake-up in the event of atmospheric entry without the time-out signal from any of the Timer boards, are purely mechanical devices closed when deceleration reaches 5.5-6.5 g.   Central Acceleration Sensor Unit (CASU) ---------------------------------------   The CASU measures axial deceleration at the centre of the Experiment Platform during entry. The signal is processed by the CDMU to calculate the time for parachute deployment (T0). The CASU operates within 0-10 g and uses a scale factor of 0.512 V/g. Its main building blocks are: 1. Power circuit. Two hot-redundant input power lines make it single    point failure-tolerant in both nominal and redundant power lines 2. Three accelerometer analogue signal conditioning blocks. A low-pass    filter with a 2 Hz cutoff is used and the analogue output from each    block is routed to both CDMUs. In addition, the design prevents    failure propagation from one conditioning chain to the others, it    withstands permanent short circuit conditions without any    degradation, and it is single point failure-tolerant toward the    input power supply line. Back-up detection of T0 is performed separately for both CDMUs by two pairs of mechanical g-switches in case the prime CASU system is inoperative. The threshold values for each pair of g-switches are 5.5 g and 1.2 g.   Radial Acceleration Sensor Unit (RASU) --------------------------------------   The RASU measures radial acceleration at the periphery of the Experiment Platform. The signal is processed by the CDMU to provide the Probe spin rate for insertion into the DDB distributed to experiments. The RASU is designed to measure spin acceleration within 0-120 mg with a 41.67 V/g scale factor. The design is based on CASU's but includes only two accelerometers.   Radar Altimeter Unit (RAU) --------------------------   The RAU proximity sensor uses two totally redundant altimeters operating with frequency-modulated carrier waves at 15.4 GHz and 15.8 GHz to measure altitude above Titan's surface, starting from about 25 km. Each of the four antennas (two per altimeter) is a planar slot radiator array providing an antenna gain of 25 dB with a symmetrical full beam width of 7.9 degrees. A continuous signal modulated in frequency with a rising and falling ramp waveform is transmitted; the received signal has a similar form, but delayed by the propagation time. Hence the range to target is proportional (with a linear frequency modulation ramp) to the instantaneous frequency shift between the transmitted and received signals. Received signal data are also provided to the Huygens Atmospheric Structure Instrument (HASI) to establish Titan's surface roughness and topography.   Probe Data Relay Subsystem (PDRS) =================================   The PDRS is Huygens' telecommunications subsystem, combining the functions of RF link, data handling and communications with the Orbiter. It transmits science and housekeeping data from the Probe to the Orbiter's PSE, which are then relayed to the Orbiter CDS via a Bus Interface Unit. In addition, the PDRS is responsible for TC distribution from the Orbiter to the Probe by umbilical during the ground and cruise checkouts. It comprises: 1. two hot-redundant S-band transmitters and two circularly polarised    Probe Transmitting Antennas (PTAs) on the Probe 2. a Receiver Front End (RFE) unit (enclosing two Low Noise Amplifiers    and a diplexer) and two Probe Support Avionics (PSA) units on the    Orbiter. The Orbiter's High Gain Antenna (HGA) acts as the PDRS receive antenna. In addition, as part of the Doppler Wind Experiment (DWE), two ultra stable oscillators are available as reference signal sources to allow the accurate measurement of the Doppler shift in the Probe- Orbiter RF link: the Transmitter Ultra Stable Oscillator (TUSO) on Huygens and the Receiver Ultra Stable Oscillator (RUSO) on the Orbiter. The PDRS electrical architecture is fully channelised for redundancy, except that TUSO and RUSO are connected to only one chain.   Probe Support Equipment (PSE) -----------------------------    Receiver Front End (RFE)  ------------------------   The RFE comprises: - two Low Noise Amplifiers (LNAs) linked to the Orbiter's HGA to   amplify the acquired RF signal by 20 dB using two cascaded FET   stages - two RF inputs: one linked to the HGA, the other via a coupler and   used during checkout to link a dedicated transmitter output (on the   Probe) to the  RFE via the umbilical - a pre-selection filter (coaxial cavity type with six poles) - an isolator - an output attenuator (fixed value) In addition, owing to the HGA's shared use with the Orbiter, a band pass filter (the TX filter) and a circulator protect the LNA chain B by isolating the Orbiter's S-band transmissions and the Probe's S-band reception, which both use the HGA. These two modes are mutually exclusive.    Probe Support Avionics (PSA)  ----------------------------   The two RFE outputs are sent to the two PSAs, which perform detection, acquisition (based on a 256-point Fast Fourier Transform algorithm), tracking, signal demodulation and data handling & management. The PSA data handling architecture is divided between analogue and digital sections. The analogue section performs signal down-conversion from S-band to the IF frequency. The IF signal is quantised and the samples processed by the digital section. The digital section performs: - the Digital Signal Processing (DSP) function - the signal   acquisition and tracking task based on FFT analysis and frequency   acquisition - the Viterbi decoding of the digital signal and delivery of the   decoded transfer frame to the data handling section at 8192 bit/s - the data handling task, which consists of:   - transforming the received transfer frame into a telemetry packet   - generating internal PSA housekeeping data (including the     synthesised frequency information) in a packet format   - controlling and managing communications with the Orbiter CDS via a     Bus Interface Unit   - distributing the telecommands from the Orbiter BIU interface. The digital section is composed of the following main modules: - the receiver digital module, comprising the UT1750 microprocessor, 8   kword RAM and 8 kword PROM, and the receiver signal processing ASIC - the interface digital module, using GaAs devices for Numerically   Controlled Oscillator (NCO) and Digital to Analogue Converter (DAC)   functions - the support interface circuitry module (SIC), which comprises: the 8   kword EEPROM to memorise software patches; the 32 kword PROM   containing the Support Avionics Software (SASW) and the testing,   telecommand, telemetry and umbilical interfaces; the MAS 281   microprocessor module used by the SASW - the BIU module that controls communications between the PSA and the   Orbiter's 1553 bus.   Probe Transmitting Terminal (PTT) ---------------------------------   The PTT comprises two transmitters and two Probe antennas. Each transmitter includes Temperature Controlled Crystal Oscillator (TCXO) synthesiser and BPSK modulator modules and a 10 W Power Amplifier module using Automatic Level Control (ALC) for 40.2 dBm nominal output power (end-of-life, worst-case, including ageing). The reference oscillator for the Phase Locked Loop (PLL) synthesiser is either an (internal) Voltage Controlled Crystal Oscillator (VCXO) with a temperature compensating network or the (external) TUSO signal. The selection between these reference sources is made before separation from the Orbiter. The TUSO has priority unless a failure is detected before separation. The two transmitting antennas linked to the transmitters (dual chains without cross-coupling) are quadrifilar helix designs. The four spirals are fed at the bottom of the helix in phase quadrature. Left Hand Circular Polarisation (LHCP) is used for signal transmission at 2040 MHz and Right Hand Circular Polarisation (RHCP) for transmission at 2098 MHz. The minimum gain for the antennas, mounted on the Top Platform, is 0.9 dB at all Probe-Orbiter aspect angles between +20 degrees and +60 degrees.   Probe data relay link budget ----------------------------   During Probe descent, starting from the time of atmospheric entry as predicted from Orbiter trajectory and Probe separation characteristics, the Orbiter HGA is controlled to track a fixed point on Titan's surface - the nominal touchdown point. Orbiter movement along its trajectory significantly reduces the 'space loss' due to link distance during the Probe's 2-2.5 h descent. However, if Huygens does not land at the nominal point, e.g. due to non-nominal entry parameters or zonal winds, the gain from the reduced distance is offset by the HGA's reduced gain from the off-axis angle of the Probe with respect to the HGA's boresight axis. The link budget worst cases occur at the beginning and end of mission. The link design attempts to equalise the BOM/EOM signal level margins. At BOM, the signal level is determined by the range, while the losses owing to off-axis pointing is mainly due to HGA pointing error and Probe delivery error (the additional dispersion arising from the entry phase is relatively minor). At EOM, however, the signal level is critically dependent on the descent duration: the off-axis pointing losses due to the Probe's lateral drift in the assumed Titan wind worsens with descent duration.   Software ========   Concept -------   The Huygens software consists of that running in the Probe CDMS, referred to as POSW, and that within the PSA on the Orbiter, referred to as the Support Avionics Software (SASW). The POSW output telemetry is relayed via the SASW and then Cassini's CDS to the ground. Two copies of the data handling hardware (CDMU and PSA) run identical copies of POSW and SASW. The software is based on a top-down hierarchical and modular approach using the Hierarchical Object-Oriented Design (HOOD) method and, except for some specific low level modules, is coded in ADA. The software consists, as much as possible, of a collation for synchronous processes timed by a hardware reference clock (8 Hz repetition rate). In order to avoid unpredictable behaviour, interrupt-driven activities are minimised. Such a design also allows a better observability and reliability of the software. Limited reprogramming accommodates modifications and RAM failure recoveries. The processes are designed to use data tables as much as possible. Mission profile reconfiguration and experiment polling can therefore be changed only by reprogramming these tables. This is possible via an EEPROM. In order to avoid a RAM modification while the software is running (which can lead to unpredictable behaviour and unnecessary complexity), direct RAM patching is forbidden. The POSW communicates with the SASW in different ways depending on mission phase. Before Probe separation, the two software subsystems communicate via an umbilical that provides both command and telemetry interfaces. Huygens cannot be commanded after separation, and telemetry is transmitted to the Orbiter via the PDRS RF link. The overall operational philosophy is that the software runs the nominal mission from power-up without checking its hardware environment or the Probe's connection or disconnection. The specific software actions or inhibitions required for ground or flight check-out must therefore be invoked by special procedures, activated by the delivery of specific telecommands to the software. To achieve this autonomy, POSW's inflight modification is autonomously applied at power-up by using a non-volatile EEPROM. At power-up, the POSW validates the CDMU EEPROM structure and then applies any software patches stored in the EEPROM before running the mission mode. If the EEPROM proves to be invalid at start-up, no patches are applied and the software continues based on the software in the CDMU ROM. A number of other checks are also carried out at start-up (e.g. a DMA check and a main ROM checksum), but the software will continue execution attempts even if the start-up checks fail.   POSW functions --------------   The POSW provides the following functions:   Probe Mission Management  - detecting time T0 as entry begins, based on the Central    Accelerometer Sensor Unit signals  - forwarding commands at the correct times to the subsystems and    experiments according to the pre-defined mission timeline  - computation of the spacecraft dynamical state from sensor readings  - sending D",,
urn:esa:psa:context:instrument_host:spacecraft.iue,INTERNATIONAL ULTRAVIOLET EXPLORER,INTERNATIONAL ULTRAVIOLET EXPLORER,"         The IUE satellite was launched on 26 January 1978 into an       elliptical geosynchronous orbit, in which it is always visible       from Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). Science operations are       conducted in real-time from GSFC for 16 hours each day. During       the remaining 8 hours, operations are conducted by the European       Space Agency at the Villafranca Satellite Tracking Station (VILSPA)       near Madrid, Spain.         Due to the ellipticity of the orbit and the subsequent daily       variations in the satellite's elevation above the horizon,  VILSPA       can view the satellite for only a  portion of each day. Since IUE's       orbit is fixed with respect to sidereal time, the handover times       between the GSFC and VILSPA observing shifts are normally changed by       2 hours each month.         Spacecraft power is provided by two large solar panels. At most       orientations the power generated by the arrays is more than       sufficient to run the spacecraft. When the spacecraft is tipped at a       large angle from the sun, however, it may be necessary to draw on       additional power from spacecraft batteries. The primary function of       the batteries is to provide power to IUE during Earth shadow periods.       Shadow seasons occur when a  portion of the IUE's orbit passes       through the Earth's shadow once each day for 3 weeks in the late       summer and winter. Additional observing constraints are invoked       during these periods to ensure that the batteries are fully recharged       before the next day's shadow.         The spacecraft is three-axis stabilized with a  nominal 1 arc-second       pointing accuracy. Control of the telescope pointing and execution       of all spacecraft motion is the primary function of IUE's on-board       computer (OBC). The OBC also performs other important functions, such       as controlling camera exposures. Prior to August 1985, the OBC used       data from three or more of IUE's six gyros to control attitude.       Following the fourth gyro failure on August 17, 1985, a backup       attitude-control system has been used. The new system (Femiano 1986)       uses the two functional gyros and the spacecraft Fine Sun Sensor       (FSS). The FSS measures the orientation of IUE with respect to the       sun. In the two-gyro/FSS system, the FSS is used primarily to control       the roll motion about the telescope optical axis. The two-gyro/FSS       system has operational capabilities and accuracies essentially       identical to the original three-gyro control system, with the       exception that the telescope can no longer be pointed within 15       degrees of the anti-solar position. The two-gyro/FSS has been       described and compared with the original three-gyro system.         The OBC processes data from the two functional gyros and the FSS and       commands the reaction wheels so that either the telescope pointing       stays fixed or the desired maneuver is performed. The reaction wheels       act as flywheels to store angular momentum. By changing speed, the       three reaction wheels cause the spacecraft to rotate about the       desired axis. The spacecraft moves from target to target by executing       a series of OBC controlled slews at a  rate of  3  to  6  degrees per       minute. These spacecraft oriented axes are pitch,  yaw,  and roll.       Only maneuvers preserving optimum illumination of the solar panels       are allowed. Under the two-gyro/FSS system, maneuvers are executed as       a sequence of slews in pitch (changing Beta, or sun angle) and at a       constant sun angle (sunline slew). The wheel speeds must stay within       certain limits, so after most maneuvers, angular momentum must be       added to or removed from the wheels. This is done by firing small       hydrazine jets and is known as a wheel unload. Since the wheel speeds       also slowly change with time while maintaining telescope pointing,       wheel unloads may also be needed prior to maneuvering after a shift-       long exposure.         At the Telescope Operations Center (TOC), the Telescope Operator (TO)       under the supervision of the Resident Astronomer (RA) controls all       aspects of the scientific instrument operation (target acquisition,       telescope focus, exposures, and camera reads) and many spacecraft       functions (maneuvering, gyro trims, offset guiding, etc.). The TO       runs control programs, known as procedures, on the ground command       computer to check ground system configuration and spacecraft       telemetry for proper status of the relevant systems before       transmitting the appropriate commands to the spacecraft. The       procedures also record scientific and engineering data which are       archived with each spectrograph or FES image. The commands are       transmitted at VHF frequencies to the spacecraft. IUE transmits a       continuous telemetry stream to the ground at S-band frequencies,       normally at a  data rate of  20  kilobits/sec. The signal is received       by an  18-meter antenna at the IUE tracking station located at the       NASA Wallops Flight Facility, Wallops Island, Virginia. The helical       VHF command antennas are also located at Wallops. The commands and       incoming telemetry are relayed between GSFC and Wallops through a       communications satellite. Once the telemetry reaches GSFC, it is       processed by the ground computer and displayed on consoles in the       Operations Control Center (OCC) for the various spacecraft subsystems       as well as in the TOC.         IUE's orbit is frequently monitored to provide accurate pointing       predictions for the ground commanding and receiving antennas. A VHF       signal is transmitted from the ground and retransmitted by the       spacecraft, giving an accurate distance and velocity of the       spacecraft (this is referred to as 'ranging'). Gravitational       perturbations cause the gradual westward precession of the orbit's       semi-major axis. A station-keeping maneuver is performed at intervals       of 6 to 9 months to prevent the satellite from passing outside the       range of ground antennas at GSFC and VILSPA. At this time, the large       hydrazine jets are fired to slightly modify the semi-major axis so       that the orbit drifts eastward again.          ",,
urn:esa:psa:context:instrument_host:spacecraft.mex,MARS EXPRESS,MARS EXPRESS,"       Instrument Host Overview   ========================     Data obtained from the Mars Express instruments were send to     ground via the spacecraft on-board computer. As spacecraft to     Earth communication does typically exclude instrument operations,     all data are relayed from the instrument to the spacecraft mass     memory, the solid state mass memory (SSMM). The data was     downlinked to Earth via the telemetry subsystem using ESA's     antenna in New Norcia, Australia, and the Deep Space Network (DSN)     antennas of NASA. The radio science experiment required data from     the New Norcia and the DSN ground station hardware. This catalogue     file gives an overview of the spacecraft and the ground stations     used. For more detailed information see the spacecraft user     manual, MEX-MMT-MA-1091.       Instrument Host Overview - Spacecraft   =====================================     The spacecraft baseline design was the combination of mission     customised configuration and mechanical / thermal architecture     with a Rosetta inherited avionics. The spacecraft design was     driven by mission requirements, science return  and system     concept. A spacecraft articulation concept with body mounted     instruments, fixed High Gain Antenna and 1 degree of freedom     steerable Solar Arrays was baselined. The spacecraft design was     based on a parallelipedic like shape sizing  about 1.7 m length,     1.7 m width and 1.4 m height. The solar array was composed of two     wings, providing a symmetrical configuration favourable to     aerobraking  techniques and minimising torques and forces applied     on the arrays and the drive mechanisms during the Mars insertion     manoeuvres performed with the main engine. So as to offer the     adequate dry mass / propellant mass ratio and large mounting     surfaces and volumes for the Orbiter instruments necessary for     Mars Express, the traditional cone/cylinder central structure has     been found less efficient than a dedicated structural concept with     only a Launch Vehicle Adapter connected to a stiffened 'box' as     now developed for light weight satellites. Within the overall     integrated design of the spacecraft, four main assemblies are     planned to simplify the development and integration process:     (1) the Propulsion Module with the core structure,     (2) the Y lateral walls, supporting the spacecraft avionics and the         solar arrays,     (3) the Y/+X shear wall and the lower and upper floors, supporting         the payload  units. The +Zb face was nominally Nadir pointed         during science observation and Lander communication relay phases         around Mars, and supported Beagle 2 (released prior to Mars         capture) the Lander(s) relay antenna and ASPERA-3, and     (4) the X lateral walls supporting the High Gain Antenna (-X) and         the instruments radiators (-X).       Attitude and Orbit Control was achieved using a set of star     sensors, gyros, accelerometers and reaction wheels. A bi-     propellant reaction control system was used for orbit and attitude     manoeuvres by either a 400 N main engine or banks of 10N     thrusters. The Data Handling is based on packet telemetry and     telecommand. The Electrical Power generation was performed by     solar arrays, the power storage by a Lithium-Ion battery. A     standard 28 V regulated main bus is offered to the payload     instruments. The RF Communications function transmitted X Band     telemetry 8 hours per day via a High Gain Antenna at rates between     about 19 and 230 kbps depending of the Mars to Earth Distance. A     variable telecommand rate of 7.81 to 2000 bps was foreseen during     up to 8 hour per day.       Spacecraft Coordinate System   ----------------------------     The origin of the spacecraft Reference Frame, named Oa, was located     at the separation plane between the spacecraft and the adapter, at     the centre of the interface diameter of 937 mm.     -  The Xa axis was contained in the spacecraft/launch vehicle        separation plane, and oriented toward the High Gain Antenna side        of the spacecraft.     -  The Za axis was coincident with the launcher X1-axis. It        represents the SC line of sight toward Mars during science        operation, and the ejection direction for the Beagle 2 probe.     -  The Ya axis was contained in the SC/LV separation plane, and        oriented so as to complete the right handed co-ordinate system.        It is therefore parallel to the solar array plane and positively        oriented opposite to Marsis antenna support wall.       The (Ob, Xb, Yb, Zb) Reference Frame is structure related, and is     not used at S/C or operations level.       Spacecraft Structure and Interface With Payload Units     -----------------------------------------------------     The selected SC structure limits the number of complex elements to     the bare minimum. Indeed, the only cylindrical part of large     dimensions was the Launch Vehicle Adapter ring, the rest of the     structural items being principally flat, standard panels with     aluminium skins and aluminium honeycomb. The structure was composed     of:     1) a Core Structure, built up from :      - One Launch Vehicle Adapter ring machined from a solid aluminium        cylinder of approx. diameter 940 mm, 200 mm height with a        thickness of 3.5 mm. This LVA was the main load path transfer        from the Spacecraft body to the launch vehicle interface.      - Two Tank Beams supporting the lower tank bosses, and embedded in        the LVA ring,      - Two Upper Tank Floors, supporting the tanks upper bosses,      - One Lower Floor.      - Two X Shear Walls,      - One Shear Walls in the Y direction       2) an Outer Structure, built up from :      - a +Z Top Floor,      - two +Y and -Y Sidewalls,      - two +X and -X Lateral Closure Panels (split to allow separate        access into each quadrant),      - various dedicated equipment support panels (PFS, Omega and        pressurant tank)      - miscellaneous brackets (e.g. to support sensors, antennas,        propulsion items, instruments).       All these elements were made of Aluminium Alloy, either from     forgings (LVA ring, tank beams and main brackets) or from     honeycomb sandwich panels. The panels were made of honeycomb     (generally type 1/8-5056- 0.001P) of 10 to 20 mm thickness, bonded     to Aluminium facesheets of thickness varying between 0.2 to 0.3 mm     and up to 0.5mm additional doubler for local reinforcements.       In general, the payload units were accommodated following their     main     needs. The payloads needing a stringent thermal control     and/or pointing performances (HRSC, OMEGA, PFS, SPICAM) were     gathered on, or close to, the +X shear wall, inside the spacecraft     and close to the AOCS reference (namely the Inertial Measurement     Package and the Star Sensors). In order to meet the PFS scanner to     PFS sensor co-alignment without disturbance caused by dismounting,     these PFS units were installed on a stiff, removable mounting     assembly which can be integrated as a single unit on the     spacecraft. To expedite installation of the large Omega-SA, this     instrument was installed via edge-mounted inserts in the Y-shear     wall and a dedicated Omega support panel. The payloads requiring a     large field of view and not necessitating stringent thermal     control were located externally on the Top and Bottom Floors     (ASPERA) or lower edge of the +Y sidewall (MARSIS). None of the     payload units required isostatic mountings: they were rigidly     fixed to the spacecraft structure utilising standard space-     industry inserts and screws. Some of the payload units were of     significant mass and therefore require the implementation of     large, face-to-face inserts that are bonded inside the sandwich     panels at the time of panel moulding. Beagle 2 was accommodated on     the top floor of the S/C, in order to minimise dynamic disturbance     (centre of mass transfer in the (X, Y) plane) and then maximise     the reliability of the Mars orbit insertion manoeuvre. The     remaining Beagle 2 hardware after probe ejection is constrained     within 50 mm height and is thermally insulated to minimise     straylight and thermal distortion disturbances respectively.     Thermal Control   ---------------     The spacecraft thermal control was in charge of maintaining all     spacecraft equipment within their allowed temperature ranges     during all mission phases. The equipments fall into two     categories: - the collectively controlled units, for which the     heat rejection and heating capabilities (design and accommodation)     are provided by the spacecraft thermal control, - the individually     controlled units, self provided with their own thermal control     features (coatings selection, heaters, insulators), for which the     spacecraft thermal design controls the thermal interfaces within     the required ranges.       A passive thermal control design was implemented for the Mars     Express     spacecraft; it was supplemented with an electrical     heating system. The heat rejection toward space was performed     using radiators mainly on the +/-Y panels for the platform     internal units and the +X panel for the payload equipments. These     sides of the spacecraft are the most favourable areas, being most     of the time protected from the direct sun inputs (always for the     +X side). The Mars planet flux are imposed by the spacecraft orbit     and attitude and mainly significant during the pericentre phase in     operation. The rest of the spacecraft is insulated with Multi     Layer Insulation blankets to minimise the heat exchange and the     temperature fluctuations.       The spacecraft external units (Platform and Payload units) were     thermally decoupled from the spacecraft and provided with their     individual radiator when needed. The electrical heater system     allowed to raise the temperature of the unit above their minimum     allowed limits, with temperature regulation functions provided     either by mechanical device or by the onboard software. Most of     the spacecraft units were collectively controlled inside defined     thermal enclosures in which the heat balances were controlled by     proper sizing of heat rejecting radiators and heating power     implementation. It allowed to maintain the unit temperatures to     acceptable levels. The heat transfer from the units to the     radiators was performed by conduction when unit baseplates were     attached to the radiator honeycomb panels and by radiation. In     that case units and panels had a black finish to maximise heat     transfer inside the thermal enclosures. For more demanding units     like the HRSC and OMEGA cameras, and the PFS spectrometer,     featuring their own thermal control, special precautions were     taken by individual trimming of their conductive and radiative     isolation. The HRSC camera required a temperature control within a     narrow temperature range): it was provided with a thermal strap     connecting it to a dedicated radiator tuned to limit the     temperature excursion in operation within a 10 degree C     temperature range. OMEGA and PFS are provided with dedicated     radiators, implemented on the +X side of the Spacecraft. Whatever     the Sun / Earth / Mars / Spacecraft geometry, the +X side of the     Spacecraft was oriented away from Sun over the complete Martian     orbit, both during Nadir pointed science phase and Earth pointed     communication phase. This allowed to provide the camera and the     spectrometer with a thermal interface at temperature lower than     175K and 190K respectively during the Planet observation. The     connection to the radiators were performed by thermal straps, the     radiators being themselves decoupled from the rest of the     spacecraft using thermal blankets and insulating stand-offs.       Payload external units like MARSIS and MELACOM antennas, ASPERA-3     units, were individually controlled units. They required large     field of view and thus were directly affected by the external     environment and they had to withstand larger temperature ranges     than the standard units. They are as far as possible insulated     from the spacecraft. Their coatings were selected and trimmed to     suit. The spacecraft interface temperature had a very limited     influence on their thermal behaviour. The propulsion equipments     that were mounted internally were in general isolated with MLI,     and provided with their own thermal control heaters: tanks, fluid     lines, valves, pressure sensors. The main engine and the thrusters     had their thermal coupling with the spacecraft tailored to meet     their thermal requirement while preserving the spacecraft thermal     behaviour. They were provided with individual electrical heaters     sized to maintain these external units within the acceptable     temperature range accounting for wide change in radiative     environment. The High Gain Antenna was using a passive thermal     control: a Kapton/Germanium sunshield was covering the whole     antenna on its front side, while a light weight MLI is used on the     rear side of the reflector.       MECHANISMS   ----------     The implementation of mechanisms into the spacecraft configuration     had been kept to the minimum. The mechanisms employed are those     associated with     - Reaction Wheel Assembly (RWA),     - Solar Array Drive Mechanism (SADM),     - Solar Array Hold-Down and Release Mechanism (HDRM),     - Solar Array Deployment System,     - Beagle-2 Spin-Up and Ejection Mechanism (SUEM) and the     - MARSIS antennas deployment mechanism.       REACTION WHEEL ASSEMBLY     The Attitude and Orbit Control System (AOCS) of the spacecraft     required implementation of four reaction wheels, used with a three     out of four redundancy. They were of ball bearing momentum /     reaction wheel type, for clock-wise and counter-clockwise     operation, with the wheel mass suspended by two angular contact     ball bearings paired by solid preloading. The main functions of     the RWA was to ensure correct orientation of the spacecraft in     fine pointing modes, and to ensure spacecraft manoeuvrability     (e.g. at transition between Mars orbit observation and     communication phases), with minimum propellant consumption (the     only related consumption lied with wheel momentum off-loading that     had to be performed at regular intervals, typically every 2 days.)       SOLAR ARRAY DRIVE MECHANISM     There were two SADM used on the spacecraft, one for each Solar     Array wing. The SADM were mounted on each side of the spacecraft,     and were independently controlled by the AOCS Processor Module.     The main functions of the SADM was to support the solar array wing     throughout the mission, to provide the electrical power and signal     interfaces to the spacecraft and to orient the solar array wing     towards the Sun by rotation about the Ys axis. The SADM was     composed of a motor and gearbox assembly, ensuring the orientation     of the solar array by rotation, a shaft and bearing assembly     ensuring mechanical connection and pointing accuracy, a twist     capsule unit transferring electrical power to the spacecraft.     Those elements were mounted on a baseplate which was attached to     the spacecraft sidewall.       SOLAR ARRAY HOLD-DOWN AND RELEASE MECHANISM     Each wing of the solar array was attached on the spacecraft     sidewall, in launch configuration, by Hold Down and Release     Mechanisms (HDRM). Each HDRM consisted in a set of hold down     bushings, attached to the structure of each panel which were held     together via a stainless steel hold down pin of 3.5 mm diameter on     a hold-down baseplate fixed on the spacecraft sidewall. The HRDM     also incorporated a pair of pyro initiators, which were actuated     after spacecraft separation from the launcher under control of the     Data Handling Processor Module. The main functions of the HDRM was     therefore to maintain safely stowed each solar array wing and to     ensure their release for proper solar array power generation.       SOLAR ARRAY DEPLOYMENT SYSTEM     Each yoke and wing of the solar array was fitted with a deployment     mechanism that ensured proper deployment and latching of the solar     array after release of the HDRM. The deployment mechanism     consisted in a set of spring energy driven hinges mounted by pair     between each solar array panel, between the first panel and the     yoke, and between the yoke and the SADM. Each hingeline was then     linked to the others by a set of pulley and cables, that ensured a     synchronised deployment of the wing. The torque margin of the     Solar Array deployment system varied between 7.5 (at beginning of     deployment) and 2.6 (at end of deployment).       BEAGLE 2 SPIN-UP AND EJECTION MECHANISM     Beagle 2 formed an integrated experiment, composed of a lander     (featuring investigation experiments) encapsulated in a Entry,     Descent and Landing System (EDLS). Those items were composing the     probe, which interfaced to the orbiter top floor through the Spin-     Up and Ejector Mechanism.       MARSIS ANTENNAS DEPLOYMENT MECHANISMS     The baseline configuration for MARSIS deployment mechanism had     departed from the Cassini (STEM) concept, i.e. a tubular antenna     made of 2 semi-circular formed strips made of Copper-Beryllium.     The selected design was the ASTRO one, consisting of a boom made     of a GFRP tube pierced with 2 diametrically opposed diamond shaped     holes at the selected distance to provide folding capability. The     antenna boom contained two wire elements forming the active     radioelectrical part of the antenna, and was folded at each     hollowed hinge and held flattened in specific containers. When     release was initiated, the container was opened through pyro     devices, and the boom was self deploying thanks to its intrinsic     energy which had been stored during the folding/flattening process     necessary to meet the launch volume constraints.         ATTITUDE AND ORBIT CONTROL SYSTEM     ---------------------------------       AOCS BASIC CONCEPTS     Due to the selection of a fixed high Gain antenna (HGA), and to     the propulsion configuration including a Main Engine, the Mars     Express mission required a high level of attitude manoeuvrability     for the spacecraft. Attitude manoeuvres were performed: - Between     the observation phase and the Earth communication phase, or to     reach specific attitudes necessary for science observations (in     particular SPICAM). - Before and after the Lander ejection, before     and after each trajectory correction manoeuvre, performed either     with the Main Engine or with the 10N thrusters. - To optimise the     Wheel Off-Loading, through the selection of an adapted attitude     for this operation.       All the attitude manoeuvres of operational phase were defined on     ground, using a polynomial description of the Quaternion to be     followed by the Spacecraft. The attitude estimation was based on     Star Tracker and gyros, ensuring the availability of the     measurements in almost any attitudes. Some constraints had however     to be fulfilled, the Star Tracker being unable to provide attitude     data, when the sun or the planet are close to or inside its Field     of view. Reaction wheels were used for almost all the attitude     manoeuvres, providing a great flexibility to the Spacecraft and     reducing the fuel consumption. The angular momentum of the wheels     had however to be managed carefully from ground.       STAR TRACKER (STR)     The Star Tracker (STR) was the main optical sensor of the AOCS,     used at the end of the attitude acquisition to acquire the final     3-axes pointing, and during almost all the nominal operations of     the mission. A medium Field Of View (16.4 deg circular) and a     sensitivity to Magnitude 5.5 were used to provide  a 3-axes     attitude measurement with at least 3 stars permanently present in     the FOV. The STR included a star pattern recognition function and     can perform autonomously the attitude acquisition. The Mars     Express Star Tracker was produced by Officine Galileo, and is     similar to the Rosetta one, except at S/W level. 2 Star Trackers     were implemented on the minus Xa face of the Spacecraft, with an     angle of 30 degree between their optical axes.       INERTIAL MEASUREMENT UNITS (IMU)     Two Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) were used by the AOCS, each     IMU including a set of 3 gyros and 3 accelerometers aligned along     3 orthogonal axes. The AOCS control used either the 3 gyros of the     same IMU (reference solution at the beginning of life) or any     combination of 3 gyros among the 6 provided by both IMUs. For the     accelerometers, only a full set of accelerometers of one single     IMU was used, due to the lower criticality of the accelerometer     function, and to the availability onboard of an alternative method     for the delta V measurement (pulse counting). The Gyros were     useful during the attitude acquisition phase for the rate control,     during the observation phase to ensure the required pointing     performances and during the trajectory corrections, for the     control robustness and failure detection. A non mechanical     technology was selected to avoid the mechanical sources of failure     in flight. The Accelerometers were essential during the main     trajectory corrections such as the insertion manoeuvre to improve     the accuracy of the delta V. The IMU of Mars Express is identical     to the Rosetta unit. Only the number of units and the onboard     management of the configuration was different.       SUN ACQUISITION SENSORS (SAS)     Two redunded Sun Acquisition Sensors (SAS) were implemented on the     Spacecraft central body and are used for the pointing of the Sun     Acquisition Mode (SAM) during the attitude acquisition or     reacquisition in case of failure. The SAS are identical to Rosetta     units, but provided with customised baffles.       REACTION WHEEL ASSEMBLY (RWA)     The Reaction Wheel Assembly (RWA) included 4 Reaction Wheels (RW)     implemented on a skewed configuration. This configuration enabled     to perform most of the nominal operations of the mission with a 3     RWL configuration among 4. During some critical phase during which     the transition to the SAM had to be avoided (before lander     ejection and before Mars Insertion Manoeuvre), a 4 wheels     configuration was be used, under ground request. The Reaction     wheels provided the AOCS control torques during all the phases of     the mission except the trajectory corrections, the attitude     acquisition and back up modes.       PROPULSION CONFIGURATION     The Propulsion configuration included a Main Engine (414 N) which     was used to perform all the major trajectory changes, and 10 N     thrusters used for the attitude control and also to produce the     thrust during the small trajectory corrections. The 10 N thrusters     configuration was optimised to perform all the attitude control     functions with only 4 redunded thrusters, each of them being     implemented near a corner of the -Z face of the spacecraft.       SOLAR ARRAY DRIVE MECHANISM     2 redunded Solar Array Drive Mechanisms (SADM) were implemented on     the Y+ and Y-walls of the spacecraft to control the orientation of     the Solar Arrays. The SADM was only used for large angle     orientation of the wings, the selected flight orientation during     the observation phase near pericentre requiring no SADM actuation,     once the observation attitude was reached. The SADM used a stepper     motor, a gear, and a twist capsule technology. The SADM motion is     defined in the range +/-180 deg (minus margins). The SADM is     identical to the Rosetta unit, except for the speed levels which     are specific to Mars Express.

The role of the guidance was     to provide onboard the reference attitude to be followed at each time     of the mission by the attitude control. It concerned of course the     orientation of the Spacecraft but also the Solar Array position. The     analysis of the mission needs showed that 4 types of guidance are     necessary along Mars Express mission:     - Pointing of the High Gain Antenna (HGA) towards the Earth, and the       Solar Array cells towards the Sun. This kind of guidance was used       during the cruise phase and for communications during the       scientific mission phase, these two cases corresponding to the AOCS       Normal Mode, pointing on ephemeredes (NM/ GSEP phase).       The information necessary to the guidance concerned the Spacecraft       to Earth and the Spacecraft to Sun directions. They were contained       in the ephemeris definition.     - This type of guidance was also used in a different way for the       Earth acquisition (SHM : Safe/Hold Mode), in order to perform the       autonomous orientation of the spacecraft towards the Earth. The       ephemeris data were then used to perform large angle slew       manoeuvres with thruster control.     - Attitude profiles : this type of guidance was necessary during the       observation phase for the Nadir pointing or to follow more specific       profiles. This function was ensured by an onboard profile       description based on Chebychev polynomial, the parameters being       uploaded from ground. This capability enabled also to ensure the       attitude slew manoeuvres.     - Fixed inertial pointing (fixed quaternion) : This type of guidance       was used for specific phases of the mission, during Orbit Control       Mode, Thruster Transition Mode or during the scientific mission       phase for SPICAM specific needs (in NM/FPIP and NM/WDP).       Three generic functions had been defined for this purpose at software     level :     - the Ground commanded guidance,     - the Onboard Ephemeris propagation,     - the Autonomous Attitude Guidance Function, this latter function       generating the guidance information necessary either for the fixed       Earth pointing or for the Earth acquisition in SHM.         GYRO-STELLAR ESTIMATION FUNCTION     The gyro-stellar estimation function was common to many AOCS modes :     It was initialised during the Sun Acquisition Mode (SAM) to prepare     the following Earth acquisition operation (SHM: Safe/Hold Mode). It     provided accurate attitude estimation during the Normal Mode of     course but also in the Orbit Control Mode (OCM) and Thruster     Transition Mode( TTM) for instance. The gyro-stellar estimator     processed gyro and star tracker (STR) measurements to provide an     accurate estimate of the spacecraft attitude. It was based on a     Kalman filter with constant covariance that allowed mixing     measurements at different rates (8 Hz for the gyros and 2 Hz for the     STR). The constant covariance reduces the computer load while     ensuring good performances. The estimated attitude was a quaternion     representing the spacecraft attitude in the J2000 inertial frame.     The gyro-stellar estimator also estimated the gyros drifts to limit     the attitude errors in case of STR measurement absence due, for     instance, to a temporarily STR occultation. A specific management of     the drift estimates was proposed for Mars Express, taking into     account the specific conditions of the scientific mission phase     (existence of rates due to varying profiles, and potential     occultation). The gyro-stellar estimator implemented a coherency test     between the gyro and STR measurements in order to detect failures     that could not be detected at equipment level.       REACTION-WHEEL OFF-LOADING FUNCTION     The wheel Off-Loading function enabled to manage the angular momentum     of the wheels to a target value, through thruster actuations. This     function was completely autonomous during the last phase of the Earth     acquisition sequence (SHM/EPP:Earth Pointing Phase). During the     nominal operations around Mars, it was preferable to command the     wheel Off-Loading from the ground, the date being optimised taking     into account the mission constraints. The Off-Loading function     managed simultaneously all the wheels. It included several sequences     of thruster pulses until angular momentum of each wheel was close to     the target value. This sequence was defined by a feed forward 3-axes     wheel torque command combined with a thruster pulse.     The sequence ended with a tranquillisation phase controlled by the     wheels, in order to damp the dynamic excitation generated by the     actuation of thrusters and wheels.       REACTION WHEEL MANAGEMENT FUNCTION     This function was active in all the modes controlled through wheel     torques (Normal Mode and Safe/Hold Mode at the end of the attitude     acquisition sequence), but also when the wheels were kept to a     constant speed through a specific control loop but not used in the     AOCS control, as in Orbit Control Mode, Thruster Transition Mode or     Braking Mode. Six states of the wheel configuration are possible with     this function depending on the control of the wheels in torques (t)     or in speed (s). For instance, the nominal operation in Normal Mode,     uses 3 wheels in torques (3t), but could sometime require a fourth     wheel if a hot redundancy is useful (4t). During trajectory     corrections the configuration included 3 wheels controlled in speed     (3s). Intermediate states are necessary between these basic     configurations in order to spin the wheels for instance (3t + 1s).     This function was also in charge of the generation of wheel torque     commands in wheel frame, and of the friction torque estimation     necessary for compensation and for the failure detection. It     interfaced also with the Wheel Off-Loading function.       THRUSTER MODULATOR AND SELECTION FUNCTION     The selected amplitude modulator and on-time summation algorithms     were re- used from Rosetta and adapted to match more efficiently the     Mars Express needs taking into account the specific thrusters     configuration.     The modulator had only one working phase where the four thrusters can     be used:     - to produce a force along the satellite Z axis direction     - to control the 3-axes satellite attitude (three torques are       commanded to the modulator).       The modulator working frequency was 8Hz. At each step, the modulation     type used (ON-modulation or OFF-modulation) was automatically     selected so as to maximise the available torque capacity for attitude     control. In the case the torque capacity was insufficient with     respect to the commanded control torque, priority is given to the     control and the commanded force ratio is automatically modified to     recover the required torque capacity. Moreover in order to limit the     actuation delay, the attitude control torque was always produced at     the beginning of the actuation period.     To limit the number of thrusters ON/OFF or to tune the control limit     cycle amplitude when using thrusters, the modulator output period had     to be changed to any period multiple of 125 ms.       PROPULSION ARCHITECTURE DESCRIPTION     -----------------------------------     A bi-propellant system based on a telecommunication spacecraft     heritage was adopted for the baseline. A set of isolation pyro valves     and latc",,
urn:esa:psa:context:instrument_host:spacecraft.rl,ROSETTA-LANDER,ROSETTA-LANDER," Lander overview ============================================= The Philae Lander is a box-type unit with the dimensions of 850 x 850 x 640 mm3. On the comet, it will rest on a tripod called Landing Gear, with a diameter of 2.6 m and will be fixed to the comet's surface by harpoons.   Philae is composed of three different parts, corresponding to its structural design:   1)    Internal compartment: This compartment hosts almost all subsystems and most of the experiment units. It provides a temperature controlled environment for all electronics and is built by the structural elements of an Instrument platform and so called Pi-plates. It is surrounded by Multilayer Insulation built of 2 tents to achieve the required insulation at a low power environment on the comet at 3 AU distance from Sun.   2)    Solar Hood: The solar hood is built around the internal compartment and its MLI tents, the shape follows the overall Lander shape. It hosts the solar arrays of the Lander composed by 6 different panels. In addition two absorber foils are mounted on the solar hood lid. These foils are built by thin copper foils with an external TINOX surface, high absorptivity and low emissivity, used to collect solar irradiation and transform it into heat radiated into the internal compartment. The solar hood also carries the camera system of the Lander, with one camera head on each panel, thus providing a 360 degrees panoramic view.   3)    Baseplate / Balcony: The baseplate is the central structural plate carrying the solar hood with the internal compartment underneath and providing at one end a special area called balcony. This area hosts all experiments or parts of them, especially the sensors, which require direct access to the comet environment and the comet surface. The baseplate is also the interface panel to the Landing Gear. In addition the baseplate hosts the Push plate, which is the interface to the Orbiter during the 10 years cruise from Launch to the Comet.   The Lander mass is around 100 kg.   In addition three units of the Lander system are mounted on the Orbiter, and will remain there after Lander separation for the comet. These units provide the interfaces to the Orbiter: electrical and data (ESS) and mechanical (MSS). The third system is a TxRx system used to keep contact to the Lander during its operational phase on the comet.     Lander Mission Requirements and Constraints ============================================= The Lander is designed to fullfill the mission requirements given as: - survive the 10 years cruise phase with long hibernation phases under   autonomous thermal control powered by the Orbiter, - land safely on the comet, - provide a scientific phase after landing at 3 AU distance from Sun   with online data transmission, - provide a long term mission capability observing the comet on its   way from 3 AU to the Sun     Lander Platform Definition ============================================= The Lander platform is built by three major subsystems, required to operate the Lander throughout the mission: -    a Power subsystem (PSS) composed of a Battery system with a         Primary Battery and a Secondary Battery, the later refilled         by a Solar array generator, and the required electronics to         distribute and control the power flow inside the Lander, -    a Central Data Management System (CDMS), composed by two hot         redundant computers, controlling all activities on the         Lander, especially on the comet in an autonomous manner, -    a Thermal Control System, composed by a 2-tent         MultiLayerInsulation supported by two absorber foils and an         electrical heater system. Additional independant heater         systems are used during the cruise phase, especially when the         Lander is in hibernation, and on the comet, when the Lander         runs out of power and changes into a so called Wake-up mode,         to provide a thermal environment in the Internal compartment         as required to switch-on the Lander electronics.     Subsystem Definiton ============================================= In addition to the already described platform units PSS, CDMS and TCS and the On-Orbiter units ESS, MSS and ESS-TxRx, a set of subsystems is installed on the Lander.   The Active Descent System ADS provides a 1-axis thruster system used at touch-down to support the landing and prevent a rebounding until the harpoons are shot. An Anchoring system, built by two redundant harpoons, is used to fix the Lander to the comet's surface after landing and provide the required counter-force during drilling. A Flywheel providing a 1-axis momentum wheel used to stabilize the Lander's descent to the comet. The Landing gear provides the necessary interface between the Lander and the comet and supports Lander science operations by a rotation and tiliting capability. The structure subsystem provides the required structural elements to built up the Lander. A TxRx system is installed to provide access to the Lander and enable data retrievel during its mission phase on the comet.     Lander Reference Frame ============================================= The Lander reference frame is defined as follows: +Z-axis is perdendicular to the baseplate, generally pointing away from the comet towards space, during cruise parallel to the Orbiter +Z-axis, +X-axis is generally parallel to the comet surface, pointing opposite of the Lander's balcony, into the direction of Lander separation from the Orbiter, during cruise into Orbiter -X direction, +Y-axis completes the right-handed frame.   The frame origin is located on the upper surface of the balcony (Z = 0), in the middle of the balcony (Y = 0), at the outer end (X = 0).       Lander Operating Modes ============================================= The Lander is operated in the following modes:   Hibernation Mode: This mode is defined as: Lander attached to the Orbiter, Orbiter LCL 5A or 5B ON, Lander Hibernation heater ON (dissipation > 12W at 28V), no power on the Lander Primary Bus In this mode the Lander is non-operational but under thermal control with a hibernation temperature inside the internal compartment above minus 55 degC at the reference point.   Wake-up Mode: This mode is applied on the comet, substituting the Hibernation Mode. The PSS wake-up thermostats are closed, because the temperature inside the internal compartment is below minus 53 degC. In this mode the Lander is non-operational, the Lander operational electronics are disconnected from the Primary Bus and the wake-up heaters are connected to the Primary Bus. In this mode NO thermal control is possible, since the wake-up heaters will only dissipate, if the Primary Bus is powered, which requires Sun irradiation on the comet to operate the solar arrays. Without dissipation the compartment temperature will drop until the comet environmental temperature. When the Lander is still attached to the Orbiter and powered from the Orbiter-LCL 15A/B, an additional heater set will also dissipate.   Power Enough Mode: This mode follows the Wake-up mode, the Lander Primary Bus is powered, but the voltage is still below 18.5V, which correspond to a non-sufficient power situation. The available power is not lost, since special Power Enough loads are used to dissipate and heat the internal compartment.   Stand-by Mode: The Lander is operational, since the Lander basic operational electronics (PCU, CDMS and one TCU) are connected to the Primary Bus and powered. In this mode thermal control will be performed from the dissipation of the activated units. If the temperature of the internal compartment drops below the TCU set-points, the respcetive TCU heaters will also dissipate.   Operational Modes: These modes define Lander operation of Experiments.     ###########TO BE COMPLETED BY SONC ############          ",,

Due to a delay of the launch a new comet (Churyumow-Gerasimenko) had been selected. The compliance of the design was checked and where necessary adapted for this new mission. Therefore in the following all the details and characteristics for this new mission are used (like min and max distance to Sun).   The Rosetta design is based on a box-type central structure, 2.8 m x 2.1 m x 2.0 m, on which all subsystems and payload equipment are mounted.  The two solar panels have a combined area of 64 m2 (32.7m tip to tip), with each extending panel measuring 14 m in length.   The 'top' of the spacecraft accommodates the payload instruments, and the 'base' of the spacecraft the subsystems. The spacecraft can be physically separated into two main modules:       * A Payload Support Module (PSM)     * A Bus Support Module (BSM)   The Lander is attached to the rear face (-X), opposite the two-axes steerable high-gain antenna (HGA). The two solar wings extend from the side faces(+/-Y). The instrument panel points almost always towards the comet, while the antennas and solar arrays point towards the Sun and Earth (at such great distances the Earth is relatively speaking in the same direction). The spacecraft attitude concept is such that the side and back panels are shaded throughout all nominal mission phases, offering a good location for radiators and louvres. This will normally be facing away from the comet, minimising the effects of cometary dust.   The spacecraft is built around a vertical thrust tube, whose diameter corresponds to the 1194 mm Ariane-5 interface. This tube contains two large, equally sized, propellant tanks, the upper one containing fuel, and the lower one containing the (heavier) oxidiser.  At launch the total amount of stored propellant was roughly 1670 kg.   A coarse overview on the spacecraft main characteristics is summarised hereafter:   Total launch mass requirement:  3065 kg Propellant mass:                1718 kg Overall size (xyz)         Launch configuration:   225x256x318 cm         SA deployed:            32.7 m tip-to-tip power provided by SA:           440 W at max dist from sun (5.3 AU) energy provided by 3 Batteries: 500 Wh data management:                operation of s/c according to an on-                                 board master schedule and real-time                                 via ground-link     Mission Requirements and Constraints =====================================================================   In the following, the stringent mission requirements are summarised and related to their consequences on the spacecraft system design.   The ambitious scientific goals of the ROSETTA mission require:   * a large number of complex scientific instruments, to be accommodated on one side of the spacecraft, that shall, in the operational phase, permanently face the comet. During cruise the instruments shall be served for survival. * one Surface Science Package (SSP), to be accommodated, suitable for cruise survival and proper, independent ejection from the orbiter (spacecraft). In addition, the orbiter shall provide the capability for SSP data relay to Earth. * a complex spacecraft navigation at low altitude orbits around an irregular celestial body with weak, asymmetric, rotating gravity field, rendered by dust and gas jets. These primary mission requirements are design driving for most of the spacecraft layout and performance features, as: * data rate (DMS, TTC) * pointing accuracy (AOCMS, Structure) * thermal layout * closed loop target tracking (AOCMS, NAV Camera), derived requirements from asteroid fly-by * small-delta-v manoeuvre accuracy (RCS)   Other mission requirements, that relate to the interplanetary cruise phases rather than to the scientific objectives, drive mainly the power supply, propulsion, autonomy, reliability and telecommunication:   For achieving the escape energy (C3=11.8 km^2/s^2) to the interplanetary injection, an Ariane 5 Launch (delayed ignition) is required, that constrains the maximum S/C wet mass and defines the available S/C envelope in Launch configuration.   The total mission delta-v of more than 2100 m/s requires a propulsion system with over 1700 kg bi-propellant.   The environmental loads (radiation, micro meteoroids impacts) over the mission duration of nearly 12 years is very demanding w.r.t. shielding, reliability and life time of the S/C components.   The large S/C to Earth distance throughout most mission phases makes a communication link via an on-board high gain antenna (HGA) mandatory. The spacecraft must provide an autonomous HGA Earth- pointing capability using star sensor attitude information and on- board stored ephemeris table. TC link via spherical LGA coverage, and TC/TM links via an MGA shall be possible as backup for a loss of the HGA link.   The wide range of S/C to Sun distances (0.88 to 5.33 AU) drive the thermal control and the size of the solar generator.   The long signal propagation time (TWTL up to 100 minutes), and the extended hibernation phases (2.5 years the longest one), and the many solar conjunctions/oppositions (the longest in active phases is 7 weeks) require a high degree of on-board autonomy, with corresponding FDIR concepts.     Platform Definition =====================================================================   The ROSETTA platform is designed to fulfill the need to accommodate the payload (including fixed, deployable and ejectable experiment packages), high gain antenna, solar arrays and propellant mass in a particular geometrical relationship (mass properties and spacecraft viewing geometry) and with the specified modularity (Bus Support Module and Payload Support Module incorporating Lander Interface Panel). The thermal environment also drives the configuration such that high dissipation units must be mounted on the side walls with thermal louvres providing trimming for changing external conditions during the mission.   The design of the platform's electrical architecture is driven by the need to meet specific power requirements at aphelion (the solar array sizing case) and to incorporate maximum power point tracking. Additional factors such as the uncertainty in the performance of the Low Intensity Low Temperature solar cell technology have also influenced the design.   The telecommunications design is driven by the need to be compatible with ESA's 15m and 32m ground stations and the 34m and 70m DSN stations. This has produced requirements for dual S/X band and variable rate capability, together with an articulated High Gain Antenna to maximise data transfer during the payload operations, and a fixed Medium Gain Antenna to act as backup for the HGA in case of failure.     Subsystem Accommodation =====================================================================   The majority of the subsystem equipments are accommodated together within the BSM. The electronic units are located mostly on the Y panels so that their thermal dissipations are closely coupled to the louvred radiators on the sidewalls. So far as practical, functionally related groups are located close together for harness, integration and testability reasons. Where possible, equipments are positioned towards the +X half of the S/C to counterbalance the mass of the Lander on the opposite side.   Some subsystem equipments are deliberately located on the PSM. These include the PDU and RTU for the payload, the NAVCAMS, two of the SAS units and the +Z LGA. The PDU and RTU are located closer to the payload instruments to reduce harness complexity and mass, and the NAVCAMs and SASs and +Z LGA are located on the PSM for field of view reasons. Other subsystem equipments have been located on the PSM sidewalls as a result of BSM equipment/harness growth, or thermal limitations. These comprise the STR electronics and SSMM as well as the USO.   The RCS subsystem comprises tanks, thrusters and the associated valves and pipework. The main tanks are accommodated within the central tube while the helium pressurisation tanks are mounted on the internal deck. Most of the valves and pipework are located on the +X BSM, panel which becomes permanently attached to the BSM once RCS assembly is completed. Sixteen of the twenty-four thrusters are located at the four lower corners of the BSM. The remaining thrusters are located in 4 groups near the top corners of the S/C. They are installed as part of the BSM, but are attached to the PSM after PSM/BSM mating.   The Star Trackers are mounted on the -X shearwalls. The STR B is rotated by additional 10 degrees towards the -Z direction compared to STR A to avoid the VIRTIS radiator rim to be seen in its field of view. This location of the STRs is both thermally stable and mechanically close to the -X PSM panel which accommodates the instruments requiring high pointing accuracy. The reaction wheels are located on the internal deck which provides them with a thermo- elastically stable location.   A 2.2m diameter HGA is stowed face-outwards for launch against the S/C +X face (so it would be partially usable even in the event of a deployment failure). After deployment, the HGA can be rotated in two axes around a pivot point on a tripod assembly some distance clear of the lower corner of the S/C. This provides the HGA with greater than hemispherical pointing range. The two MGAs are fixed mounted on the S/C +X face, oriented in the +Xs/c direction, as this is the most useful direction for a fixed MGA. The LGAs are located at the +Z and -Z ends of the S/C but angled at 30 degs to the Z axis. This accommodation provides spherical coverage with minimum need for switching.   The solar array comprises two 5-panel wings folded against the Spacecraft Y axis for launch. Because the arrays are sized to operate at aphelion, the outwards facing outer panel can also generate useful power before array deployment.   Two Sun Acquisition Sensors are located on the solar arrays and another two on the S/C body. Their design and location of these also allow them to serve as fine Sun sensors.     Rosetta Spacecraft Frame =====================================================================      Rosetta spacecraft frame is defined as follows:         -  +Z axis is perpendicular to the launch vehicle interface          plane and points toward the payload side;       -  +X axis is perpendicular to the HGA mounting plane and          points toward HGA;       -  +Y axis completes the frame is right-handed.       -  the origin of this frame is the launch vehicle interface          point.      These diagrams illustrate the ROS_SPACECRAFT frame:      +X s/c side (HGA side) view:    ----------------------------                                    ^                                    | toward comet                                    |                                 Science Deck                             ._____________.   .__  _______________.     |             |     .______________  ___.   |  \ \               \    |             |    /               \ \  |   |  / /                \   |  +Zsc       |   /                / /  |   |  \ \                 `. |      ^      | .'                 \ \  |   |  / /                 | o|      |      |o |                 / /  |   |  \ \                 .' |      |      | `.                 \ \  |   |  / /                /   |      |      |   \                / /  |   .__\ \_______________/    |  +Xsc|      |    \_______________\ \__.     -Y Solar Array          .______o-------> +Ysc   +Y Solar Array                                 ._____.                               .'       `.                              /           \                             .   `.   .'   .          +Xsc is out of                             |     `o'     |             the page                             .      |      .                              \     |     /                               `.       .'

Mounted to the BSM is the Lander Interface Panel (LIP), which can be handled separately for the Lander integration.   The spacecraft structural design is based on a version with a central cylinder accommodating the two propellant tanks. The general dimensions are dictated on one hand by the need to accommodate the two large tanks, to provide sufficient mounting area for the payload and subsystems and the Lander, as well as being able to accommodate two large solar arrays, and on the other hand by the requirement to fit within the Ariane 5 fairing.   The spine of the structure is the central tube, to which the honeycomb panels are mounted. The spacecraft box is closed by lateral panels, which are connected to the central tube by load carrying vertical shear webs and an internal deck.   The Bus Support Module (BSM) accommodates most of the platform and avionic equipment.   The Payload Support Module (PSM) is accommodating all science equipment. The PSM structure consists of the PSM +z-panel, the PSM -x panel, the PSM +y/-y panels and the Lander Interface Panel (LIP).   Most instrument sensors are located on a single face, the +Z panel, with the exception of VIRTIS and OSIRIS mounted on the -X panel to allow for the accommodation of their cold radiators, Alice mounted on PSM -X and COSIMA mounted on the PSM -Y panel. The P/L electronics are mounted on the +Y and -Y side of this module for heat radiation via Louvers.   Special supports are provided by the structure for:   Solar Array ----------- They provide stiff and accurately positioned points for the solar array hold down points and for solar arrays drive mechanisms.   Reaction Wheels --------------- The brackets provide stiff wheel support with alignment capability. All 4 RW brackets are mounted together between the +X shear wall and the central deck building one compact bracket unit which provides high stiffness and stability.   Propellant Tanks ---------------- The two tanks are mounted via a circumferential ring of flanges to a reinforced adapter ring on the tube with titanium screws.   Helium Tanks ------------ The two helium tanks are mounted on the main deck of the BSM. They are attached by an equatorial fixation in the middle of the tank through internal deck holes.   Thrusters --------- Thrusters on the side of the spacecraft are mounted on lateral panel extensions with aluminium machined brackets ensuring the angular position of the thrusters. Thrusters underneath the spacecraft (-Z pointing thrusters) are mounted on brackets on the corners of the +/-Y panels.   High Gain Antenna ----------------- The HGA is stowed against the +X panel, in areas stiffened by the +/-Y panels and the HGA support tripod. After launch, the HGA is deployed and is connected to the S/C by the support tripod only. The axis Antenna Pointing Mechanisms, fixed on the tripod, are located close to the edge of the HGA.   Gyros ----- A single bracket provides stiff gyro support and alignment capability and orientates the 3 IMUs in the requested angular orientation. The bracket is mounted on the -Y BSM panel for thermal dissipation reasons.     Mechanisms Design =====================================================================   The ROSETTA mechanisms comprise the following major equipments: * Solar Array Drive Mechanism (SADM) * Solar Array Deployment Mechanisms * HGA Antenna Pointing Mechanism (APM) * HGA Holddown & Release Mechanism (HRM) * Experiment Booms & HRMs * Louvres (mechanical elements)     Solar Array Drive Mechanism (SADM) ---------------------------------- The SADM performs the positioning of the Solar Array w.r.t. the Sun by rotation of the panels around the spacecraft Y-axis. There are two identical SADMs on both sides of the spacecraft, which can be individually controlled. The control authority rests with the AOCMS subsystem, which always 'knows' the actual attitude and Sun direction and is therefore in the position to determine the required orientation of the solar panels. The positioning commands are routed from the AOCMS I/F Unit via the SADE (SADM-Electronics) to the SADM.   The Solar Array rotation is limited to plus and minus 180 degrees to the reference position. The array zero position is defined in the section 'Power Design: Solar Array Generator' below.   The Solar Array Drive Mechanism baseline design comprises the following major components: * Housing structure from aluminium alloy * Main bearing, pre-loaded angular contact roller bearing * Drive unit consisting of a redundantly wound stepper motor, gear-   reduction unit, anti-backlash pinion, and final stage gear ring * Redundant position transducer and electronics, harness and   connectors. * Mechanical end-stop for +/-180 deg travel limit with redundant   micro-switches (4 in all) * Redundant electrical power and signal harnesses, and connectors * Twist capsule unit, allowing +/-180 deg electrical circuit transfer * Thermistor for temperature reading, with harness.   The SADM drive unit employs a 'pancake' configuration with one single X-type ballbearing to provide high moment stiffness and strength within a compact axial envelope. The central output shaft is of hollow construction, providing sufficient space to accommodate the power and signal transfer harness and a twist capsule allowing +/-180 degrees rotation of the harness. The drive unit contains a position transducer and a drive train.   The Solar Arrays Drive Electronic is intended to manage two Solar Array Drives that can be rotated so as to get the maximum energy from the solar cell panels.     Solar Array Deployment Mechanisms ---------------------------------- The baseline are 2 solar arrays, each with a full silicon 5-panel wing, with panel sizes as used in the ARA MK3 5-panel qualification wing (about 5.3 m2 per panel).   During launch the wings are stowed against the sidewalls of the satellite. They are kept in this position by means of 6 hold-down mechanisms per wing.   Approximately 3 hours after launch, the satellite is pointed towards the Sun and the wings are deployed to their fully deployed position. They are released for full deployment by 'cutting' Kevlar restraint cables by means of thermal knives (actually degrading of the Kevlar by heat).   The deployment system makes use of spring driven hinges and is equipped with a damper, that limits the deployment speed of the wing. Thus, the deployment shocks on SADM hinge and inter-panel hinges are kept relatively low.   The Rosetta wing is further equipped with: * ESD protection on front and rear side, * Solar Array sun acquisition sensor, * Solar Array performance strings     HGA Antenna Pointing Mechanism (APM) ------------------------------------ The APM is a two-axes mechanism which allows motion of the HGA in both azimuth and elevation. The control authority rests with the AOCMS subsystem, which always 'knows' the actual attitude and Earth direction and is therefore in the position to determine the required orientation of the antenna. The positioning commands are routed from the AOCMS I/F Unit via the APM-E (APM-Electronics) to the APMM. HGA elevation rotation is physically limited to +30deg/ -165deg from the reference position (after deployment). Before and during deployment the range is -207deg and +30deg.   HGA azimuth rotation is physically limited to +80deg / -260deg from the reference position.   The main functions of the APM are:   * Allow accurate and stable pointing of the antenna dish through controlled rotation about azimuth and elevation axes. * Minimise stresses on the waveguides by acting as load transfer path between the HGA and the spacecraft.   It consists of three main components: * The motor drive units (APM-M) and RF Ancillary Equipment (Rotary   Joint) * The support structure (APM-SS). * The electronic control of these units (APM-E).   The APM-M is mounted between the antenna dish and the APM-SS.   For thermal reasons the elements of the APM-M and APM-SS and the Antenna HDRMs are covered with MLI.     Experiment Boom Mechanisms --------------------------- Two deployable experiment booms support a number of different lightweight sensors from the plasma package which need to be deployed clear of the S/C body. These booms are deployed at beginning of the mission after Launch.   Each boom consists of a 76 mm dia CFRP tube. The lower boom is approximately 1.3 m long and the upper boom 2m.   The boom deployment is performed by means of a motor driven unit. The deployment mechanism consists of:   * Hinge, Motor Gear Unit, Coupling system, Latching system and   Position switches.   The Hold down and release mechanisms, one per boom, has the following characteristics: * Three Titanium blades to allow relative displacement in the boom   centreline direction. This reduces the mechanical and thermo-   elastic I/F forces. * The separation device is the Hi-Shear low shock Separation Nut   SN9422-M8     Louvres -------- The Rosetta Thermal Control Subsystem contains 14 louvers with 2 different set points which are located on the S/C Y walls in front of white painted radiators. The louvers are designed, manufactured and qualified by SENER.   The mechanisms of the 16 blade louver are the 8 temperature dependent bi-metal springs (actuators), which supply the fundamental function of the louver. The actuators are driving the louver blades to its end stops for the defined fully open / fully closed temperature set points.     Thermal Control Design =====================================================================   Thermal Control Concept -----------------------   The thermal control design is driven on one side by the low heater power availability together with the low solar intensity in the cold case, and on the other side by the hot cases characterised by high dissipation of the operational units and high external heat loads.   The thermal control concept mainly utilises conventional passive components supported by active units like heaters and controlled radiative areas, using well proven methods and classical elements.   This concept can be characterised as follows :   * Heat flows from and to the external environment are minimised using   high performance Multi-Layer Insulation (MLI). * Most unit heat is rejected through dedicated white paint radiator,   actively controlled by louvers, located on very low Sun-illuminated   +/-Y panels. * High internal emissivity compartments reduce structural temperature   gradients. * Individually controlled instruments and appendages (booms, antennas   ,...) are mounted thermally decoupled from the structure. * High temperature MLI is used in the vicinity of thrusters. * Optimised heaters, dedicated to operational, and hibernation modes,   are monitored and controlled to judiciously compensate the heat   deficit during cold environment phases.     Thermal control design ----------------------- The thermal control subsystem (TCS) design is optimised for the enveloping design cases of the end of life comet operations and the aphelion hibernation. From the overall mission point of view the deep space hibernation heater power request is the most critical thermal design case. This heater power request is dependent on the radiator sizing which need to be performed for worst case end of mission conditions. The very strong heater power limitation implies that to a certain extent constraints in the operation and/or attitude need to be accepted for hot case.   The TCS uses a combination of selected surface finishes, heaters, multi-layer insulation (MLI) and louvres to control the units in the allowable temperature ranges. The units are mostly mounted on the main +/- Y panels of the spacecraft (and +Z for experiments), with interface fillers to enhance the conductive link to the panel for the collectively controlled units. The individually controlled experiments are thermally decoupled from the structure.   Generated heat by the collectively controlled units is then rejected via conduction into the panel and subsequent radiation from the external surface of the panel to space. These surfaces are covered with louvers over white painted radiators minimising any absorbed heat inputs and heat losses in cold mission phases. The louvers are selected as baseline being the best solution (investigated during phase B) for flexibility, qualification status and reliability.   VIRTIS and OSIRIS cameras are located at the top of the -X (anti-sun face) so that their radiator may view deep space. The top floor is extended over the top as a sunshield to prevent any direct solar illumination of these instruments, while the sun angle on the -Z side has to be limited to 80 degrees for the same reason.   Any external structural surface not required as a radiator, (or experiment aperture) is covered with a high performance MLI blanket. The bottom of the bus module, which is not enclosed with a structural panel, is covered with a high performance MLI blanket used also as an EMC screen. In the areas around thrusters, a high temperature version of the MLI are implemented. All blankets are adequately grounded and vented.   The bi-propellant propulsion subsystem needs to be maintained between 0 to +45 degrees throughout the mission. This is far warmer than some units, particularly when the spacecraft is in deep space hibernation mode. The tanks and RCS are therefore well isolated from the rest of the spacecraft to allow their specific thermal control.   The antennae and experiment booms are passively thermally controlled by the use of appropriate thermo-optical surface finishes and MLI. The mechanism for the HGA has similar appropriate passive control but also needs heaters to prevent the mechanism from freezing. It is thermally decoupled from the rest of the spacecraft to allow its dedicated thermal control.   The chosen solution for thermal control subsystem design uses well known and proven technologies and concepts.     General Heater Control Concept ------------------------------- The operation of the TCS shall enable to maintain all spacecraft units within the required temperature range throughout the entire mission coping with all possible spacecraft orientations and unit mode operations.   The thermal heater concept uses the following major control features:   * Thermistor controlled (software) heater circuits, which are used to maintain platform, avionics and payload units within operating limits when these units are operating.   * The S/W heater design includes 3 control thermistors sited next to each other and uses the middle temperature reading to control the heater switching. This method is used in order to maximise the reliability of thermistor controlling temperature.   * Thermistors will be also used to monitor the temperature at each unit's temperature reference point (TRP) and at the System Interface Temperature Points (STP).   * Thermostat controlled (hardware) heater circuits, which are used to maintain platform, avionics and payload units within their non- operating (or switch-on) limits when these units are non-operating. These operate autonomously during satellite hibernation and Safe modes to ensure thermal control.   * The hardware heater circuits will be controlled by one thermostat (cold guard) connected in redundant circuit. The prime circuits without any thermostat will be powered as long as the relevant LCL is defined to be enabled. In the prime circuit a thermostat (hot guard) is included to prevent from overheating. In the event of a failure in the prime circuit the redundant circuit is automatically switched on when the temperature falls because it is permanently enabled.   * The lower set points for the thermostats (cold guard) are at the lower nonoperating limits of units. The hysteresis of the thermostats is chosen to 35 degrees Celsius to limit the number of switching cycles for the long Rosetta mission. The higher set points of the prime thermostats (hot guard) is oriented to the upper operational temperature limit, but will still have an appropriate margin to that limit.   * Main and redundant heaters will be in separate foil heaters. It is necessary to define reserved unpainted areas on all units, which would nominally be black painted, specifically for the mounting of heaters.   All software and hardware heaters circuits will comprise a simple series connection of heaters with no parallel connections. The heater concept assumes prime and redundant heater elements in different mats. The heaters will be mounted directly onto units as this maximises the efficiency of the heating.   The sizing of the autonomous H/W heater circuits are based upon the following criteria:   * Payload heaters shall be designed to maintain non-operating temperature limits at 5.33AU or switch-on limits at 3.25AU, whichever gives the greater heater power requirement,   * Platform and Avionics units OFF in hibernation have heaters designed to maintain non-operating temperature limits at 5.33AU or switch-on limits at 4.5AU, whichever is the greater power requirement,   * Platform and Avionics units ON during hibernation have heaters designed to maintain operating temperature limits at 5.33 AU.   The suppliers of individually controlled (I/C) units shall size their S/W and H/W heaters by themselves and may install them where they wish in order to control their unit temperatures.

This protection is only applied to the exposed +",,

Experiment requirements for       electromagnetic cleanliness (EMC) and for minimisation of the       RTG radiation environment resulted in a 5.6 m long radial       boom which carries several experiment sensors and is mounted       on the opposite side of the spacecraft to the RTG.  A 72.5 m       tip-to-tip dipole wire boom and a 7.5 m axial boom serve as       electrical antennas for the Unified Radio and Plasma Wave       Experiment ([STONEETAL1992A]).  Most of the scientific       instruments are mounted on the main body, as far as possible       removed from the RTG, and in compliance with the       field-of-view requirements of the experiment sensors.  The       spacecraft mass at launch was 367 kg including 55 kg of       payload and 33.5 kg of hydrazine for orbit, attitude and spin       rate adjustments.         The HGA meets the radio-link requirement to Earth with 20 W       X-band and 5 W S-band transmitters.  The uplink S-band       carries commands and ranging code.  The downlinks in X- and       S-band carry telemetry and turnaround ranging code,       respectively.  (S-band telemetry could only be used in the       early orbit phase at close distance to Earth).  This       simultaneous ranging and telemetry is a basic feature of the       spacecraft communication system.         Spacecraft mass properties and balance have been a driver in       the spacecraft design to meet the requirements both for the       launch configuration and for the deployed boom configuration       with the HGA pointing towards Earth.  The spin axis of the       launch configuration was the geometric centre line.  The       theoretical spin axis in deployed configuration is aligned       with the electrical axis of the HGA.         Near-continuous data throughout the mission is a prime       scientific requirement.  Since continuous coverage by ground       stations is impossible for such a long-duration mission, data       are stored on-board and replayed, interleaved with real-time       data, during periods of coverage.  The nominal tracking       coverage is 8 h in every 24 h.         A variety of downlink bit rates up to 8192 bit/s is       selectable, which can provide real-time data rates between       128 and 1024 bit/s and stored data rates between 128 and 512       bit/s.  The prime data rates are 1024 bit/s for real-time       data ('tracking mode') and 512 bit/s for stored data       ('storage mode').  The reason for the disparity between the       maximum downlink rate of 8192 bit/s and the real-time data rate       of 1024 bit/s has to do with Ulysses' science objective of       providing 'continuous' data.  With a single 34-m DSN pass per day       most of the data downlinked during a DSN pass is not real-time,       but playback data, which is sometimes collected at a lower rate.         A strong scientific requirement was to have an       electromagnetically and electrostatically clean spacecraft;       EMC considerations have therefore driven the mechanical       configuration design.  The spacecraft is divided into a       'quiet' and a 'noisy' zone.  The former comprises an       electromagnetically shielded compartment of sensitive       experiments, whereas the latter contains the less-       susceptible but more emissive electrical spacecraft       subsystems.  The preamplifiers for the wire booms and the       axial boom are mounted outside the overall spacecraft       compartment, which acts as a Faraday cage against fields       generated inside.  A unipoint grounding concept has been       implemented in which the main platform constitutes an       electrical ground reference with only one area which serves       as grounding starpoint for the electrical system.  All units       that produce significant magnetic fields are removed as far       as possible from the magnetometers.  Low-impedance ground bus       bars are isolated from the platform and connected to it only       at the starpoint.  Strict control of the magnetic properties       of all subsystems and experiments was exercised.  For       example, the RTG was magnetically compensated.         The electrostatic cleanliness requirement for low-energy       particle measurements ([BAMEETAL1992A]) has been achieved by       making all external surfaces of the spacecraft electrically       conducting.  This measure will also prevent differential       charging of parts of the spacecraft in the Jovian       magnetosphere.         The Jupiter gravity assist necessitates the spacecraft's       passage through the Jovian radiation belts.  All subsystems       and experiments have therefore been designed to survive this       environment and radiation-hardened parts (design dose rate 60       krad) have been used throughout the spacecraft.         The spacecraft also provides autonomous system capabilities       for failure-mode detection and for safe spacecraft       reconfiguration.  This is required during unexpected and/or       predicted periods of nontracking and because of the long       signal travel time between ground and spacecraft.  The       preprogrammable functions include search-mode initiation to       reacquire the Earth if no command is received after a       preselectable time of up to 30 d, switch-over to redundant       units, and preprogrammed attitude manoeuvres at superior       conjunctions.         Structure and Mechanisms     ------------------------       The Ulysses spacecraft has a box-type structure with two       overhanging 'balconies' and a single aluminium honeycomb       equipment platform.  All electronics units of the scientific       instruments and spacecraft subsystems, most of the sensors       and the propellant tank are mounted on this platform.  The       RTG is mounted on an outrigger structure to minimise its       radiation effects and to isolate the main subsystems and the       experiments from excess heat.         The two-section radial boom carries the two magnetometer       sensors ([BALOGHETAL1992A]), the solar X-ray/cosmic gamma-ray       burst sensors ([HURLEYETAL1992]) and the magnetic search-coil       sensor of the wave experiment ([STONEETAL1992A]).  Because of       the radiation pattern of the RTG, it was necessary to have       the gamma-ray sensor lying as closely as possible along the       RTG centre axis.  The related boom configuration achieves       this whilst maintaining the maximum length of the boom       consistent with a two-hinge system and satisfying the       requirement for the spacecraft to be balanced in both the       stowed and deployed boom configurations.  The boom section       material is carbon-fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP) tubing       with a 50 mm diameter and 1 mm wall thickness.         The electrical antennae of the wave experiment       ([STONEETAL1992A]) consist of a pair of radially extending       wire booms in the spin plane and an axial boom deployed along       the orbital spin axis.  The wire booms consist of 5 mm wide       and 0.04 mm thick Cu-Be ribbon stowed during launch on two       identical drive units.  The wires were deployed to a length       of 72.5 m tip-to-tip by centrifugal forces acting on tip       masses after the second trajectory correction manoeuvre       (TCM-2).  Each wire boom has a passive tubular root damper       which reduces relative motions between the boom and the       spacecraft by natural material damping with a time constant       of 3.5 h.  The axial boom element is formed by a       pre-stressed, coilable elastic Cu-Be tube anchored in the       axial-boom drive mechanism located on the rear face of the       spacecraft.  The boom element was deployed to a length of 7.5       m by a traction force through a set of rollers driven by a       stepper motor one day after the wire booms.         Several experiment sensors had protective covers on ground       and during launch; these were all successfully opened in the       first month of operation.         Thermal Subsystem     -----------------       Thermal control of the spacecraft, its subsystems and of most       of the experiments is achieved by passive means in       conjunction with a commandable internal/external power dump       and heater system.  This involves an optimised layout of       subsystems which avoids hot spots on the spacecraft platform,       an efficient thermal-blanket design in order to minimise the       solar input, the compensation, by the power dump system, of       heat fluxes which are caused by the varying solar input and a       heater system for individual critical units.  The most       stringent requirements on the thermal subsystem are to       guarantee a temperature above +5 degrees C at all times for       the hydrazine of the Attitude and Orbit Control Subsystem       (AOCS) and a temperature below +35 degrees C for all       experiment solid-state detectors.  All spacecraft walls are       covered with thermal multilayer blankets, which are closely       fitted around the experiment-sensor apertures.  The blankets       consist typically of 20 layers of aluminised mylar.  The       outermost layer is kapton, coated with a transparent       conductive coating (Indium Tin Oxide) to provide an       electrically conductive outer spacecraft surface.  Heat       rejection is performed by a thermal radiator, located on the       rear of the spacecraft and covered by a 2 mil kapton foil.       All units external to the spacecraft (e.g.  several       experiments) are thermally decoupled from the interior.         RTG and Power Subsystems     ------------------------       Electrical power is provided by the RTG at a level of about       280 W at the beginning of the mission, decreasing to about 250       W at nominal mission end.  The RTG, which generates 4500 W of       thermal energy, has two major components: a heat source and a       converter.  The General-Purpose Heat Source (GPHS) consists       of several elements containing the isotopic fuel 238 Pu, in       the form of PuO2.  The radioactive decay energy is absorbed       at the heat source-converter interface where heat is       produced.  The Si-Ge converter contains thermoelectric       elements which convert the heat into electrical energy.       Power is delivered to the experiments and subsystems at 28V       +/-2%.         Communication Subsystem     -----------------------       The communication subsystem provides capabilities for       telemetry with bit rates up to 8 kbit/s, ranging, telecommand       and radio science.  It operates in X-band (downlink) and       S-band (up- and downlink).  The subsystem includes two       redundant transponders (each consisting of an X-band exciter,       a modulator, an S-band receiver and an S-band power       amplifier), two redundant 20 W X-band Travelling-Wave-Tube       Amplifiers (TWTA), a TWTA Interface Unit and an S-band       Radio-Frequency Distribution Unit.  A considerable amount of       cross-coupling capability exists within the subsystem       ([BIRDETAL1992A], [EATON1990]).         The parabolic HGA, with both X-band (8.4 GHz) and S-band (2.3       GHz) capabilities, is the prime communications link.       Telemetry is provided in X-band, with a 2 degree beamwidth       (3 dB); downlink S-band is used for ranging, and       radio-science investigations.  S- or X-band ranging       operations can be performed with or without telemetry       transmission.  Both transponders can be operated       simultaneously, one in X-band and the other in S-band.         A special feature of the HGA is its ability to measure the       offset of the spin axis from the direction of the ground       station by the CONSCAN (conical scan) system.  This is       accomplished by a tilt of 1.8 degrees between the S-band       antenna pattern and the spin axis which results in a spin       modulation in the uplink signal strength as the satellite       rotates.  Processing within the Attitude and Orbit Control       Subsystem (AOCS) gives the offset magnitude and direction       which is either transmitted for ground analysis or employed       in a closed loop control system to minimise the offset.       Attitude adjustments are made by operating hydrazine       thrusters.         Command and Data-Handling Subsystem     -----------------------------------       The command and data-handling subsystem provides capabilities       for ground commanding, a variety of telemetry formats,       on-board data storage, and, in combination with the AOCS,       safe automatic manoeuvring.         The telecommand decoder checks commands for validity and       distributes them to the experiments and subsystems.  There       are directly executed commands and memory-load commands.  The       latter are stored as block commands that are validated prior       to execution of critical operations.  A command-time-tagging       capability over a range of 32 s to 24 d is also available.         The Central Terminal Unit (CTU) processes command messages       received from the decoder, provides on-board timing       information, and performs formatting and encoding of data to       be sent to the ground.  It also controls all on-board       automatic functions.  The CTU contains a provision to       auto-check its own functioning and to switch over to the       redundant CTU in the event that a failure is detected,       assuring that important spacecraft information is maintained.         The CTU contains a master crystal oscillator from which all       synchronisation and timing signals for subsystems and payload       are derived.  32-bit timing information with a resolution of       2 s is included in every telemetry format, ensuring       unambiguous identification of the telemetry data throughout       the mission lifetime.  A spin reference ('Sun pulse') and       spin segment clock (16384 pulses per spin period) are also       supplied by the CTU, based on Sun-sensor data provided by the       AOCS subsystem.         The Data Storage Units consist of two redundant tape       recorders for storage of data during those periods when the       spacecraft is not in communication with the ground       (nontracking periods) for subsequent playback and       transmission during the next tracking period.  The 45 Mbit       capacity of each tape recorder is sufficient to provide       continuous storage at 512 bit/s for 22 h or 256 bit/s for 44       h.         Telemetry formats are built up of successive frames.  There       are three data formats:         - Scientific format consisting of 32 scientific frames       - Interleaved format consisting of a block of 32 frames,         interleaving real-time and stored frames with a selectable         ratio (1:1, 1:3, 1:7). Formats are played back in reverse         time order, but the frames within each format and each         individual frame are in forward order       - Engineering format consisting of two frames of spacecraft         housekeeping data and containing no scientific data.         Telemetry channels are sampled in a time-ordered fashion and       allocated to specific words (8 bit), which are arranged into       frames of 128 words.  In the scientific and interleaved       formats one frame consists of 110 digital science words, nine       analogue science words, two subcommutated experiment       housekeeping words, four subcommutated spacecraft       housekeeping words and three synchronisation and       identification words.  Analogue channels are sampled and       converted into 8-bit words with an accuracy of 1% full scale.       There are also datation channels which contain accurate time       information on an event with a resolution of 0.488 ms (32 s       range) or 3.9 ms (256 c range).  Datation channels are used       by the gamma ray-burst instrument (high resolution) and by       the magnetometer and wave experiments (low resolution).         Attitude and Orbit Control Subsystem (AOCS)     -------------------------------------------       The primary operational functions of the AOCS are to maintain       the spacecraft spin axis Earth-pointing and control the spin       rate.  Additional operational functions are dictated by       trajectory control requirements, nutation damping, and by the       measurement of the attitude for scientific reasons.         The spacecraft Earth-pointing attitude is measured and       controlled by the CONSCAN system with spin-rate, spin-phase       and solar-aspect-angle information determined from redundant       Sun sensors.  The Sun-sensor outputs are processed in the       data- handling subsystem to provide the spin reference pulse       and the spin segment clock.  These signals and the Sun-sensor       data are then used in the AOCS electronics to determine the       spacecraft spin rate and solar aspect angle for the purpose       of closed loop on-board control, failure detection and       recovery.  Hydrazine thrusters are actuated either by       telecommand or automously.  These are fed from a single tank,       mounted at the launch centre of gravity, and arranged in two       blocks of four thrusters each, providing complete redundancy.         Another AOCS operation is the periodic precession manoeuvring       for correction of the apparent Earth drift with respect to       the spin axis.  These can be performed in closed loop       on-board or in open loop via time-tagged command.         A special manoeuvre strategy is required for conjunctions,       since the proper spacecraft attitude depends on the operation       of the Sun sensors with a safe operational limit of the solar       aspect angle greater than 1.25 degrees.         The spacecraft carries three nutation dampers containing a       fluid whose viscous motion dissipates energy.  In the       operational spin rate range the nominal damping time constant       for nutation cone angles from 2.0 to 0.02 degrees is less than       one hour.         The AOCS also includes failure-mode-detection and protection       functions which result in fail-safe operation and a       reacquisition capability in both automatic and       ground-initiated recovery sequence.       In-Flight Performance   =====================     Following launch and orbit injection of Ulysses on 6 October 1990,     the initial flight phase consisted of checking out all spacecraft     subsystems (including redundancy), deploying the radial, axial and     wire booms and switching on all experiments. The latter were     commanded on one-by-one and thoroughly checked over an extended     period between 19 October and 16 November 1990. Early in January     1991 the spacecraft was formally declared to be commissioned.       Anomalies     ---------     The following is a list of (major) spacecraft anomalies to have     occurred since launch:        Nutation. Shortly after deployment of the axial boom, build-up of a      nutation-like disturbance was observed. This is now believed to be      the result of an oscillation induced by non-uniform solar heating      of the axial boom coupling into the spacecraft motion, together      with under-performance of the passive nutation dampers on board the      spacecraft. The onboard CONSCAN system has been successfully      employed to control subsequent episodes of nutation, which occurred      in 1994 and 1995. Nutation is predicted to return in 2001. More      details on the nutation anomaly are discussed in the Ulysses      MISSION.CAT.        Disconnect Non-Essential Loads (DNEL). The DNEL condition is a      spacecraft safing mode, and is known to be associated with      operation of the latching valve when coinciding with unpredictable      peaks in payload current demand. Overcurrent criteria are violated,      and the onboard protection logic correctly operates, placing the      spacecraft in a minimum current demand mode by disconnecting the      scientific payload.  To date, 8 DNEL events have occurred.        CTU-2 Anomaly. During check-out of the Data Handling Subsystem      following Jupiter flyby, telemetry from the redundant Central      Terminal Unit (CTU-2) was found to be partially corrupted. CTU-2 is      a redundant unit, however, and will only be used in case of CTU-1      failure. If this occurs, extra data processing will be implemented      to minimise the impact of the CTU-2 malfunction.

urn:esa:psa:context:instrument_host:spacecraft.vex,VENUS EXPRESS,VENUS EXPRESS,"   This document largely includes sections of the following articles: The Venus Express Spacecraft System Design, by P. Sivac and T. Schirmann [SIVAC&SCHIRMANN2007].   Instrument Host Overview ========================   Venus Express is the second of the so-called Flexi-missions of ESA and with some differences imposed by the environment in orbit around Venus is, from a spacecraft design point of view almost an exact replica of the first Flexi-mission Mars Express. The satellite was launched on 9 November 2005 on a Soyuz rocket from Baikonur and was injected into its trajectory towards Venus using the Fregat upper stage. After a journey of about five months, Venus Express was inserted in orbit around the planet on 11 April 2006 and started its nominal scientific mission on 4 June 2006. The major objective of the Venus Express spacecraft design was to cope with the specific mission requirements of a spacecraft orbiting Venus (mainly associated with the much higher temperatures) whilst maximising the reuse of the Mars Express design and so minimising the development risks in order to guarantee the readiness of the spacecraft for the launch window.   Mechanical design =================   The mechanical design was driven by the following considerations:     - reuse of the Mars Express mechanical bus as far as possible;     - the specific constraints of the Venus Express mission;     - the need to minimise the spacecraft dry mass and optimise the       location of the centre-of-mass. The reuse of the Mars Express mechanical bus (structure and propulsion system) minimised the development risks and helped to secure the programme very tight schedule. Drawing on the Mars Express qualification, the core structure design remained basically unchanged, which allowed qualification by similarity. The modifications to the secondary structure were strictly limited to accommodation of the new or modified units. Reusing the bus also meant that most of the Venus Express units have the same mechanical environment as on Mars Express. The main mechanical design modifications relate to the payloads, the additional High Gain Antenna and the constraints from the thermal design. As on Mars Express, the overall spacecraft mass was close scrutinised. The maximum mass of the spacecraft (including propellants) allowed by the launcher was agreed at 1270 kg. Through careful mass management, the propellant tanks   could be filled to their maximum capacities. Close attention was paid to the centre-of-mass and the alignment of the main engine. During the main engine burn for Venus orbit insertion, the disturbing torques imposed on the spacecraft were directly linked to the offset between the direction of thrust and the centre-of-mass, which migrated as propellant was depleted. To improve the control torque margins, strict control of the centres-of-mass of individual units was maintained and balance masses were added for fine adjustment.   Thermal control ===============   The spacecraft thermal control subsystem is required to maintain the temperatures of spacecraft elements within their allowed temperature ranges during all mission phases. The spacecraft equipment fall into two categories namely: a) The units that are collectively controlled by the overall spacecraft thermal control b) The units that have their own thermal control such as individual heaters or radiators. The thermal control design of Venus Express is based on a robust and passive concept having a maximum commonality with Mars Express but having some specific design modifications in order to cope with the hot environment at Venus.   The two main differences with Mars Express are: a) A harsher thermal environment. The solar constant is almost four times that of Mars. Furthermore, the Venus albedo makes a significant contribution to the overall flux on the spacecraft during the observation phase around the pericentre. b) Since the orbit of Venus is closer to the Sun than the one of the Earth, it is not possible to keep one wall of the spacecraft permanently in the shadow during communications with the Earth having a single antenna. For this reason, having analysed the allowable Sun aspect angles on the various faces of the spacecraft, it has been decided to include a second smaller high gain antenna on the top floor of the spacecraft.   Most of the spacecraft units are collectively controlled inside thermal enclosures that are naturally created by the spacecraft mechanical configuration. The heat balance is controlled by radiators and heaters, allowing the unit temperatures to be maintained within their defined limits. The unit temperature control is achieved through the use and the selection of flight-tested materials used on numerous spacecraft.   The key features of the thermal control are summarised as follows: a) Optical solar reflectors radiators which are electrically grounded to the aluminum sandwich panel face sheet and dissipate internal heat towards space b) Dedicated radiators provided for both VIRTIS and PFS which require low temperatures for operations c) Platform high dissipative units mounted directly behind the radiators in order to provide a good conductive path from unit to radiator panel d) Heat pipes implemented under the PCU and PDU units in order to evenly spread the high PCU thermal dissipation e) Thermal straps used to connect the Reaction Wheels and those payload units requiring a dedicated radiator (i.e PFS, SPICAV/SOIR,VIRTIS)   Heaters are managed either under software control or by thermostats.   Chemical propulsion subsystem ============================= The Chemical Propulsion Subsystem (CPS) is a helium-pressurised bipropellant system, using monomethyl hydrazine (MMH) as the fuel and nitrogen tetroxide (NTO) with 3% nitric oxide as the oxidiser. The main engine, essential for Venus orbit insertion, has a thrust of 414 N and a specific impulse of 317 s. Four pairs of 10 N thrusters (four primary, four redundant) provide trajectory corrections and attitude control and reaction wheel unloading. They are the same as those used on Mars Express. The CPS operated in a constant-pressure mode during main engine firings for the capture manoeuvre and the first part of the apocentre reduction manoeuvre, using a regulated helium supply. The CPS comprises two subsystems: the pressurant subsystem and the propellant feed subsystem. The helium pressurant subsystem, commonly referred to as the 'gas side', has two sections: high-pressure and low-pressure. The highpressure gas side comprises a 35.5-litre helium tank, normally-open and normally-closed pyrovalves, a high-range pressure transducer, a fill & drain valve, and a test port to support integration activities. This section has a maximum expected operating pressure (MEOP) of 276 bar. During all ground operations and launch, it was isolated from the pressure regulator by a pair of normally-closed pyrovalves. These are arranged in parallel for redundancy. The low-pressure gas side comprises a pressure regulator, non-return valves, a pair of low-flow latch valves, a low-range pressure transducer, normally-closed pyrovalves, and test ports and fill & vent valves. This section has an MEOP of 20 bar, controlled by the regulator that senses downstream pressure. The propellant feed subsystem, commonly referred to as the 'liquid side', supplies propellants to the main engine and thrusters. It comprises a pair of 267-litre propellant tanks, normally-open and normally-closed pyrovalves, propellant filters, low-range pressure transducers, main engine, reaction control thrusters, and test ports and fill & drain valves. This section is pressurised with helium from the low-pressure gas side, and has an MEOP of 20 bar.   Power Subsystem ===============   Electrical power is provided by two solar wings equipped with triple-junction GaAs cells. The array is oriented towards the Sun by two Solar Array Drive Mechanisms (SADM). During eclipses, power is provided by three lithium-ion batteries that recharge after the eclipse. Power management and regulation is performed by the Power Control Unit (PCU) that provides a regulated 28 V main bus. The PCU uses a Maximum Power Point Tracker (MPPT) in order to operate at the maximum power output of the solar array, which avoids the need to oversize the solar array to cope with both near-Earth and Venus orbit conditions. Battery management is performed using three Battery Charge and Discharge Regulators (BCDRs) under the control of a Main Error Amplifier (MEA) control loop. The resulting +28 V regulated bus is distributed to all spacecraft users by a Power Distribution Unit (PDU) featuring Latching Current Limiters (LCLs), which protect the bus from overcurrents at unit level. The PDU is also responsible for generating the commands for firing the pyrotechnics.   The solar array consists of two identical low-weight deployable wings, each having two solar panels pointed towards the Sun by a one degree-of-freedom SADM. When stowed, each wing was clamped to the spacecraft side panel on four hold-down points and release mechanisms. For deployment (which was performed autonomously after launch as part of the separation sequence), redundant pyrotechnic bolt cutters released each wing individually. In order to meet the stringent requirements associated with the Venus radiation environment, the chosen solar cell technology was GaAs with 100 micrometer cover glass. The maximum array current is 18 A per wing. The total array power values are of the order of 820 W near Earth and 1400 W at Venus (end-of-life).   Three batteries supply the spacecraft power if either the solar array is not illuminated by the Sun or if the power demand is higher than can be generated by the array. The energy is stored in three identical 24 Ah low-mass Li-ion batteries with a total capacity of around 500 Wh. Each has 16 parallel strings of six serial 1.5 Ah cells. The batteries are identical to those on Mars Express.   Radio-frequency communications subsystem ========================================   The radio-frequency (RF) communication subsystem consists of a redundant set of dual-band transponders operating in both S-band and X-band for either the uplink or the downlink. The antennas on the spacecraft are:    - two Low Gain Antennas (LGA), used primarily during the Launch      and Early Operations Phase (LEOP), operating in S-band for      omni-directional reception and hemispherical transmission;    - the dual-band HGA1, operating in S-band and X-band for high-rate      telemetry and telecommand;    - the single-band offset HGA2, operating in X-band only, for      high-rate telemetry and telecommand.   All nominal operations are performed at X-band. Selection of which HGA to use depends on the mission phase and, particularly, the relative positions of the Earth, spacecraft and Venus. To maintain thermal control for instruments, solar illumination of the -X side of the spacecraft (opposite to HGA1) is minimised. With steady-state Earth communications, the spacecraft Z/X plane remains in the Sun-spacecraft-Earth plane. This means that:    - no Sun impinges on the lateral sides (+/-Y sides);    - the solar array can be pointed towards the Sun;    - HGA1 or 2 can be pointed towards Earth;    - the cold side of the spacecraft (-X) remains facing cold space. Before the Sun starts to impinge on the cold side, as the spacecraft and Venus orbit the Sun, the spacecraft is flipped to point the opposite antenna towards Earth.   Ground stations ===============   The ground station used throughout all mission phases are the ESA Cebreros 35m station, complemented by the ESA New Norcia 35m station, to support Venus Orbit Insertion and VeRa campaigns, and the Kourou 15m station during LEOP. Use of the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) is envisaged for emergency cases or for special campaigns.   Payload =======   The Venus Express payload includes seven instruments. Five of them are re-used from the Mars Express and Rosetta projects with small modifications:    - ASPERA analyzer of space plasma and energetic neutral atom      imager;    - PFS a high-resolution IR Fourier spectrometer;    - SPICAV/SOIR a versatile UV-IR spectrometer for solar/ stellar    occultation and nadir observations;    - VeRa a radio science experiment;    - VIRTIS a sensitive visible and near infrared spectro-imager and      high resolution spectrometer. These experiments are complemented by two small units specifically developed for the Venus Express mission. They are:    - Venus Monitoring Camera (VMC)    - magnetometer (MAG). Details about these instruments can be found in the INSTRUMENT.CAT files that are included in the experiment data sets.   Payload operations ==================   Payload scientific operations are conducted according to the observation scenarios or feasible combinations of the defined ten science cases whenever they are compatible with spacecraft and ground segment resources.   Payload observation scenarios:   I   Observation scenario 1   Pericenter observation 2   Off-pericenter observation 3   Apocenter global spectral-imaging by VIRTIS 4   VeRa bi-static sounding 5   SPICAV stellar occultation 6   SPICAV/SOIR solar occultation 7   Limb observation 8   VeRa Earth radio occultation 9   VeRa solar superior and inferior conjunction 10  Venus Gravity Anomaly by VeRA   Data downlink is performed during daily station passes. It is assumed that during the station pass science observations do not interfere with the Earth pointing. Under nominal conditions the station passes is such that an average of 8.5 hours continuous is available daily for stored data downlink. An average bandwidth of ca 7 kbps is allocated to the downlink of stored spacecraft telemetry, assuming a continuous generation rate of 2.5 kbps throughout the 24 hours for spacecraft housekeeping telemetry. Radio Science (VeRa) observations are conducted for Earth occultations with the spacecraft inertially fixed, for short periods when the line of sight between spacecraft HGA antenna and Earth ground station pass through the Venus atmosphere. In support of dual frequency measurements (X/S-band) above and beyond the Cebreros 35 m (X-band) occasional use is made of the New Norcia 35 m and DSN 34 and 70 m ground stations (S/X-band). As far as possible, the orbit phasing will be such that SC entry and exit of Earth occultation will occur during NNO passes. During the VeRa radio occultation the spacecraft is required to perform a slew manoeuvre to compensate for ray bending due to atmospheric refraction.   Attitude and Orbit Control System =================================   The characteristics of the mission and the fact that the spacecraft has fixed High Gain Antennas and a single rigidly-mounted main engine means that there are demanding manoeuvering requirements.   Attitude ascertainment is provided by two Star Trackers (STTs) which in turn are supported by redundant Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs), and a Sun Acquisition Sensor (SAS). Attitude control is established by a reaction wheel assembly supported by the attitude thruster system.   Star Trackers ------------- The autonomous star tracker with its extensive star catalogue ensures that accurate attitude estimation can be achieved in almost any position. It is the main optical sensor of the AOCS and is used at the end of the attitude acquisition following each manoeuvre to acquire the 3-axis pointing required for almost all nominal operations. The star tracker includes a star pattern-recognition function and can perform attitude acquisition autonomously. Venus Express has two star trackers aligned with an angle of 30 degrees of arc between their optical axes for operational redundancy and to ensure that one can always see a recognizable region of the sky.   Inertial Measurement Units -------------------------- Each of the two IMUs has a set of three gyros and three accelerometers aligned along three orthogonal axes. The AOCS can use either the three gyros of the same IMU or any combination of three gyros among the total of six. Only a full set of accelerometers from one single IMU is used; they are essential to improve the accuracy of manoeuvres performed with the main engine. The gyros are used during attitude acquisition phases for rate control, during observation and communication phases to ensure the required pointing performance and during the trajectory correction manoeuvres for control robustness and failure detection. The non-mechanical technology removes the possibility of mechanical failure during the mission.   Sun Acquisition Sensor ---------------------- Two redundant SASs mounted on the spacecraft central body ensure pointing in the Sun Acquisition Mode at the time of first acquisition after launch or any subsequent reacquisition in the case of an FDIR activity following an onboard failure. The Mars Express sensors were modified, using different solar cells with ceramic backing in order to cope with the thermal environment at Venus.   Reaction Wheel Assembly ----------------------- The reaction wheels are used for most of the attitude manoeuvres for specific activities such as Earth communication and scientific observations; they provide flexibility and reduce overall propellant consumption. The angular momentum of the wheels has to be carefully managed from the ground; regular off-loading keeps the wheel speeds within performance limits. The RSA comprises four individual wheels in a skewed configuration to manage the spacecraft momentum in all three axes. Although nominally all four wheels are used for operations, this configuration, which is identical to Mars Express, allows full performance with any three-wheel configuration.   AOCS Modes ---------- The AOCS includes several modes for attitude acquisition/ reacquisition, the nominal scientific mission and orbit control.   The attitude acquisition and reacquisition sequence has two basic modes: 1) the Sun Acquisition Mode, pointing the X-axis and the solar array towards the Sun in order to guarantee power. 2) the Safe/Hold Mode, which completes the acquisition phase and provides the final 3-axis pointing, with one High Gain Antenna pointing towards the Earth to guarantee telemetry and telecommanding.   Trajectory correction manoeuvres are performed using two modes: 1) the Orbit Control Mode, for small corrections using the attitude thrusters; 2) the Main Engine Boost Mode, for major manoeuvres using the main engine;   To ensure a smooth transition between the thruster-controlled modes and wheel-controlled modes there is also: 1) a Thruster Transition Mode   Data Handling Subsystem =======================   The Data Management System (DMS) performs all the data handling functions for the spacecraft, including: 1) telecommand distribution throughout the spacecraft; 2) telemetry data collection from the spacecraft and data storage; 3) overall supervision and monitoring of the spacecraft and payload functions and health status; 4) timing functions, including the distributions of time and synchronization information.   The DMS is based on a dual-processor architecture embedding standard communication links. The DMS includes four identical processor modules, located in two fully redundant Control & Data Management Units (CDMSs). One processor module is dedicated to the DMS software (in charge of the management of the platform subsystems), while the other is allocated to the AOCS software (in charge of acquisition and control of all platform sensors, actuators and Solar Array Driving Mechanism (SADM)).   The data handling architecture is organized around the two CDMUs. They are in charge of controlling ground command reception and execution, onboard housekeeping and science data telemetry storage and formatting for transmission. Onboard data management, control-law processing and execution of onboard control procedures are also part of their function. Each CDMU features two MA3-1750 processor modules, each processing either DMS or AOCS software. A builtin failure operational reconfiguration module ensures system-level Failure Detection, Isolation and Recovery integrity and autonomously reconfigures the CDMU processor units as necessary. The CDMUs communicate directly with the Dual Band Transponder that is part of the RF Communications System.   Three other units are part of the data handling subsystem: 1) the Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) is the interface between the DMS processor module and platform units (Power Control and Distributions Units) and payloads; 2) the AOCS Interface Unit (AIU) is the interface between the AOCS processor module and the sensors, actuators and solar array drive electronics; 3) the Solid State Mass Memory (SSMM) is a file-organized mass memory with 12 gigabit of storage that is used to store the housekeeping and science data collected by the CDMU; it also collects science data directly from the VIRTIS and VMC instruments.   The use of SSMM is dictated by the same store-and-forward concept employed for Mars Express, meaning that every orbit is divided into two principal phases: an observation phase, where the instruments are pointed towards Venus, and a communication phase where a HGA is pointed towards the Earth. To support this, all scientific and housekeeping telemetry are stored in the SSMM.   Failure Detection, Isolation and Recovery =========================================   As a deep space mission, Venus Express requires a high level of onboard autonomy because of the time needed for ground intervention in the event of an onboard anomaly or the extended periods when communications are not possible owing to the respective positions of the Sun, Venus and Earth. The automatic FDIR function is largely recurrent from Mars Express, with some adaptations.   The FDIR function handles any anomalies onboard with a first goal of returning to the same spacecraft mode in order to preserve operational integrity. If this is not achievable, then the priority is to preserve spacecraft integrity and safety. In this case, the spacecraft autonomously enters safe mode, which ensures that power is available from the solar array, communication with Earth is available for diagnostics and recovery, and all non-essential loads have been switched off. In this way, spacecraft safety is ensured until operators on Earth can identify and correct the anomaly and proceed with the mission.            ",,

The Peregrine propulsion system consists of five main engines and twelve Attitude and Control System (ACS) engines powered by a pressure-fed hypergolic bipropellant, which does not require ignition because the fuel and oxidizer combust on contact. The fuel is Mono-Methyl-Hydrazine (MMH) and the oxidizer used is a solution of nitric oxide in dinitrogen tetroxide/nitrogen dioxide, 25% Mixed Oxides of Nitrogen (MON-25).Peregrine’s Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) system orients and flies the lander throughout the mission using input from the star tracker, sun sensors, and inertial measurement unit. During landing operations, a Doppler LiDAR provides range and range rate information that guides the lander to a safe landing at the target site. The lander power system is responsible for power storage, generation, distribution, and management using a space-grade lithium-ion battery and a top mounted solar panel The battery feeds into a 28 Vdc power rail from which unregulated and regulated power is distributed to all lander subsystems and payloads. Peregrine’s communications system uses a high-powered and flight-heritage transponder to communicate with Earth via multiple low gain antennas for optimal coverage during cruise and lunar orbit operations and then an actuated medium or high gain antenna following touchdown on the lunar surface for increased bandwidth.

For GRAIL this is partly true.   There are two data types, the primary is from the links between the   spacecraft, and those data become available via telemetry.  The   second type is a one-way X-band Doppler link from each spacecraft to   the DSN stations. This science link supplements the LGRS on-board   observations and, again, make the DSN a part of the GRAIL science   instrumentation.  The following sections provide an overview of the   spacecraft and their science instruments followed by the DSN ground   system.       Instrument Host Overview - Spacecraft   =====================================       Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory Spacecraft     ---------------------------------------------------     The GRAIL spacecraft design was based on the Lockheed Martin (LM)     Experimental Small Satellite-11 technology demonstration mission     for the United States Air Force, and the avionics were derived     from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. A single-string     architecture met this short mission's reliability requirements.     The resulting design met all GRAIL mission and science     requirements with ample technical margins, providing flexibility     to solve problems that might arise during development and which     met or exceeded design principles established by the Jet     Propulsion Laboratory.       Each of the two GRAIL spacecraft, GRAIL-A and GRAIL-B, was about     the size of a washing machine and had about 200 kg of mass. They     were nearly identical; but the need to point antennas at one     another required differences in the MoonKAM mounting and in the     angles of the star trackers used for attitude control and the     antennas through which the orbiters measured the changing     distance between them. These factors also required that GRAIL-B     precede GRAIL-A in lunar orbit.       Each spacecraft bus was a rectangular composite structure. The     science payload ranging antennas were in thermal enclosures and     were mounted so that they were nominally on the line between the     centers of mass of the two spacecraft. The other components of the     payload instrument were on a single interior bus panel for easy     integration and testing.       Two non-articulated solar arrays of XSS-11 heritage were deployed     just after separation from the launch vehicle. Warm gas systems,     identical to those on XSS-11, provided delta-V for maneuvers and     unloading of the 3 reaction wheels. Additional attitude sensing     components included an inertial measurement unit (IMU), a sun     sensor and a star tracker.       Command and Data Handling (C&DH), power management, and the     lithium ion battery also had XSS-11 heritage. The S-band     telecommunications sub-system for communication with the DSN used     components with heritage from Themis and Genesis.       The spacecraft was built and the science payload was integrated     and tested at Lockheed Martin's Denver facility. LM used two     system-level spacecraft test labs (STL) and one software simulator     (SoftSim) testbed with unlimited copies that enabled integration     and verification of all hardware and software throughout the     Assembly Test and Launch Operations (ATLO) cycle.       See [HOFFMAN2009] for more information about the spacecraft.       Spacecraft Configurations     -------------------------     During its mission, GRAIL needed to operate in four distinct     mission configurations.       Launch: During launch, the two spacecraft had to be fitted together     within the nose cone, or payload fairing, of the launch vehicle.     Large parts, such as the solar arrays, were designed to be folded     up.       Cruise: As soon as the two spacecraft were clear of the launch     vehicle, the body-fixed solar arrays were deployed to begin     producing power. The high-gain antenna also became operational.       Lunar Orbit Insertion: The lunar orbit insertion required numerous     maneuvers to circularize the two orbits. No science observations     took place, as the spacecraft were not in formation flying yet.       Science Operations: During the Science Phase, the two spacecraft     were placed in a precision formation flying configuration in order     to point to each other and exchange two radio links at Ka- and     S-bands.       Coordinate Systems     ------------------       Two coordinate systems are used to reference the various GRAIL     instruments. The definitions are summarized below.       1) Mechanical Frame (MF): This is defined by the spacecraft     manufacturer. It is the reference frame for such things as KBR     horn location, center of mass, and thruster locations.       +X = Parallel to, and in opposite direction from, the solar array     normal vector     +Z = Normal to star tracker bus plate     +Y = +Z ? +X       An onboard attitude control sub-system approximately orients the     mechanical frame with -Z along the line of flight and -/+ Y     pointed towards the moon.       2) Science Reference Frame (SRF): This is the Mechanical Frame as     realized by the Star Tracker. If the Star Tracker were perfectly     aligned, MF would equal SRF. SRF is the reference frame for GRAIL     science measurements.       Major Spacecraft Components     ---------------------------     Science Payload Instruments:       There are two payload elements on each GRAIL orbiter: the Lunar     Gravity Ranging System (LGRS) which is the science instrument, and     the MoonKAM lunar-imager which is used for Education and Public     Outreach. The LGRS is based on the instrument used for the Gravity     Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission, which has been     mapping Earth's gravity since 2002. The LGRS is responsible for     sending and receiving the signals needed to accurately and     precisely measure the changes in range between the two orbiters.     The LGRS consists of an Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO), Microwave     Assembly (MWA), a Time-Transfer Assembly (TTA), and the Gravity     Recovery Processor Assembly (GPA).       The USO provides a steady reference signal that is used by all of     the instrument subsystems. Within the LGRS, the USO provides the     reference frequency for the MWA and the TTA. The MWA converts the     USO reference signal to the Ka-band frequency, which is     transmitted to the other orbiter.       The function of the TTA is to provide a two-way time-transfer link     between the spacecraft to both synchronize and measure the clock     offset between the two LGRS clocks. The TTA generates an S-band     signal from the USO reference frequency and sends a GPS-like     ranging code to the other spacecraft. The GPA combines all the     inputs received from the MWA and TTA to produce the radiometric     data that are downlinked to the ground. In addition to acquiring     the inter-spacecraft measurements, the LGRS also provides a     one-way signal to the ground based on the USO, which is     transmitted via the X-band Radio Science Beacon (RSB). The     steady-state drift of the USO is measured via the one-way Doppler     data provided by the RSB.       The LGRS instrument is summarized below.            2 X-band beacon antennas for Doppler ranging measurements            when the spacecraft was visible from Earth. The X-band            signal was carrier-only and not          1 S-band time-transfer system antenna, which sent a            time-synchronization code back and forth between the            spacecraft          1 Ka-band ranging antenna for precision distance measurement            between the spacecraft       For more information on the GRAIL radio systems, see     [KLIPSTEINETAL2009].       Structures:       The solar panels and antennas were body fixed, so there were no     moving parts in the spacecraft structure that would affect science     observations.       Telecommunications Sub-System:       The telecom sub-system included the following on each spacecraft:            2 S-band transponder antennas to communicate with Earth       Each of the pairs of S-band transponder antennas had one antenna     mounted on the sunny side of the spacecraft and one mounted on the     dark side. The sunny-side antennas pointed to Earth during the     full moon and the dark-side antennas pointed to Earth during new     moon. This design obviated the need to mechanically rotate the     antennas during the mission, which would have moved the     spacecraft's center of mass with respect to the Ka-Band ranging     and X-Band beacon paths, disturbing the science measurements.       Propulsion Sub-System:       The propulsion sub-system on each spacecraft included:       A propellant tank, which could hold up to 103.5 kilograms of the     monopropellant hydrazine.       A hydrazine catalytic thruster for lunar-orbit insertion and     trajectory changes, and a warm-gas system with 8 thruster valves     for attitude control and other small maneuvers.       Command and Data-Handling Sub-System:       The C&DH sub-system controlled all spacecraft functions. This     system:            * managed all forms of data on the spacecraft;          * executed commands (including maneuver commands) sent from            Earth;          * prepared data for transmission to Earth;          * managed collection of solar power and charging of the            batteries;          * collected and processed information about all sub-systems            and payloads;          * kept and distributed the spacecraft time;          * calculated spacecraft position in orbit around the Moon;          * autonomously monitored and responded to any onboard            problems that occurred.       The key parts of this system were:            Space Flight Computer          Flight Software          Solid State Recorder       Attitude Control Sub-system:       The Attiude Control Sub-system (ACS) controlled the orientation of     the orbiter as it traveled through space and maintained knowledge     of where celestial bodies were located -- for example, Earth and     the Sun. This knowledge was critical for the spacecraft to perform     the correct maneuvers to get to the Moon, to keep its solar arrays     pointed toward the Sun for battery charging, and to keep its     S-Band antenna pointed toward the Earth in order to maintain     communications.       Once in orbit around the Moon, the ACS also maintained constant     knowledge of where the spacecraft was in its orbit.       The Attitude Control sub-system provided three-axis stabilized     control and consisted of a sun sensor, a star tracker, reaction     wheels, and an inertial measurement unit.       Electrical Power:       The electrical power sub-system was responsible for generating,     storing, and distributing power to the orbiter systems. The     electrical power system included two solar arrays and a lithium     ion battery. Each solar array was capable of producing 700 watts     at the end of the mission. The arrays were deployed shortly after     separation from the launch vehicle and remained fixed throughout     the mission. Each battery had a capacity of 30 amp-hours and was     used to provide power when the spacecraft was in the Moon's     shadow.       Solar panels: The only source of replenishable power is sunlight.     Solar panels are mounted one side of each orbiter and capable in a     body-fixed position.       Thermal Sub-Systems:       The thermal sub-system maintained the right temperatures in all     parts of the spacecraft. It employed several conduction- and     radiation-based techniques for thermal control.  Its components     included:            Radiators          Surface coatings          Thermal blankets          Heaters       Instrument Host Overview - DSN   ==============================     Radio Science investigations utilized instrumentation with elements   both on the spacecraft and at the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN).   Much of this was shared equipment, being used for routine   telecommunications as well as for Radio Science.     The Deep Space Network was a telecommunications facility managed by   the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of   Technology for the U.S.  National Aeronautics and Space   Administration.     The primary function of the DSN was to provide two-way   communications between the Earth and spacecraft exploring the solar   system.  To carry out this function the DSN was equipped with   high-power transmitters, low-noise amplifiers and receivers, and   appropriate monitoring and control systems.     The DSN consisted of three complexes situated at approximately   equally spaced longitudinal intervals around the globe at Goldstone   (near Barstow, California), Robledo (near Madrid, Spain), and   Tidbinbilla (near Canberra, Australia).  Two of the complexes were   located in the northern hemisphere while the third was in the   southern hemisphere.     The network comprised four subnets, each of which included one   antenna at each complex.  The four subnets were defined according to   the properties of their respective antennas: 70-m diameter, standard   34-m diameter, high-efficiency 34-m diameter, and 26-m diameter.     These DSN complexes, in conjunction with telecommunications   subsystems onboard planetary spacecraft, constituted the major   elements of instrumentation for radio science investigations.

Once in orbit around the Moon, the ACS also maintained constant     knowledge of where the spacecraft was in its orbit.       The Attitude Control sub-system provided three-axis stabilized     control and consisted of a sun sensor, a star tracker, reaction     wheels, and an inertial measurement unit.       Electrical Power:       The electrical power sub-system was responsible for generating,     storing, and distributing power to the orbiter systems. The     electrical power system included two solar arrays and a lithium     ion battery. Each solar array was capable of producing 700 watts     at the end of the mission. The arrays were deployed shortly after     separation from the launch vehicle and remained fixed throughout     the mission. Each battery had a capacity of 30 amp-hours and was     used to provide power when the spacecraft was in the Moon's     shadow.       Solar panels: The only source of replenishable power is sunlight.     Solar panels are mounted one side of each orbiter and capable in a     body-fixed position.       Thermal Sub-Systems:       The thermal sub-system maintained the right temperatures in all     parts of the spacecraft. It employed several conduction- and     radiation-based techniques for thermal control.  Its components     included:            Radiators          Surface coatings          Thermal blankets          Heaters       Instrument Host Overview - DSN   ==============================     Radio Science investigations utilized instrumentation with elements   both on the spacecraft and at the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN).   Much of this was shared equipment, being used for routine   telecommunications as well as for Radio Science.     The Deep Space Network was a telecommunications facility managed by   the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of   Technology for the U.S.  National Aeronautics and Space   Administration.     The primary function of the DSN was to provide two-way   communications between the Earth and spacecraft exploring the solar   system.  To carry out this function the DSN was equipped with   high-power transmitters, low-noise amplifiers and receivers, and   appropriate monitoring and control systems.     The DSN consisted of three complexes situated at approximately   equally spaced longitudinal intervals around the globe at Goldstone   (near Barstow, California), Robledo (near Madrid, Spain), and   Tidbinbilla (near Canberra, Australia).  Two of the complexes were   located in the northern hemisphere while the third was in the   southern hemisphere.     The network comprised four subnets, each of which included one   antenna at each complex.  The four subnets were defined according to   the properties of their respective antennas: 70-m diameter, standard   34-m diameter, high-efficiency 34-m diameter, and 26-m diameter.     These DSN complexes, in conjunction with telecommunications   subsystems onboard planetary spacecraft, constituted the major   elements of instrumentation for radio science investigations.

Two solar panel wings with a total array area of 12 square meters protrude from the side and a 1.5 m diameter high-gain parabolic antenna is mounted on top on a two-axis gimbal. A cylindrical sampler horn, deployed shortly after launch, protrudes from the bottom of the spacecraft. The Minerva lander was also mounted on th spacecraft near the bottom panel. Hayabusa is propelled during cruise phases by two microwave ion thruster engines, which use a microwave discharge to ionize xenon gas. The ionized plasma is accelerated by high-voltage electrodes through four thruster heads which protrude from one side of the spacecraft body to provide a peak thrust of 20 mN using 1 kW power. A nitrogen tetroxide/hydrazine propulsion system with a peak thrust of 22 N will be used for maneuvering. The spacecraft is powered by gallium-arsenide solar cells and a 15 A-hr rechargeable nickel-metal hydride (Ni-MH) battery.

On October 4, 2007, after passing              through a phasing orbit 2.5 times around the Earth, Kaguya was inserted              into a large elliptical orbit circling the Moon. After the apolune altitude             was lowered, Kaguya reached its nominal 100 km circular polar observation              orbit on October 19. During the process of realizing the nominal orbit,              two subsatellites Okina (Rstar) and Ouna (Vstar) were released into              elliptical orbits with 2400 km and 800 km apolune, respectively; both              elliptical orbits had 100 km perilunes. After the functionality of bus              system was verified, four radar antennas and a magnetometer boom were              extended, and a plasma imager was deployed. Acquisition of scientific              data was carried out for 10 months of nominal mission that began in              mid-December 2007. During the 8-month extended mission, magnetic fields              and gamma-rays from lower orbits were measured; in addition to this,              low-altitude observations were carried out using a Terrain Camera, a              Multiband Imager, and an HDTV camera.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument_host:spacecraft.lcross,LUNAR CRATER OBSERVATION AND SENSING SATELLITE,LUNAR CRATER OBSERVATION AND SENSING SATELLITE,"       Instrument Host Overview     =========================       The LCROSS (Lunar CRater Observation and Sensing Satellite)     mission was conceived as a low-cost means of determining the     nature of hydrogen detected at the polar regions of the moon.       LCROSS was selected as the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO)     secondary payload on April 10th, 2006 and launched with LRO on     June 18th, 2009.  To meet the requirements of a secondary     payload, the LCROSS Shepherding Spacecraft (SSC) was built     around an EELV Secondary Payload Adapter (ESPA) ring, originally     designed as a mating interface for up to six small spacecraft or     experiments as secondary payloads on Delta IV and Atlas V     launches.  Developed by Northrop Grumman, the SSC featured five     equipment panels and a solar array mounted radially at the ESPA     mate ports.  A single monopropellant tank was mounted within the     ESPA ring.  For launch, the nearly 900 kg (wet mass) LCROSS     SSC was mated between the Centaur upper stage and LRO.       The SSC utilized copies of several LRO avionics units, including     its RAD750-based single-board computer, power and thruster     control electronics, S-band communications electronics, and     SpaceWire bus electronics.  LCROSS flight software derived     heavily from software on previous programs, including EO-1 and     WMAP.  LCROSS communicated in S-band via two omnidirectional     antennas and two medium-gain antennas.  Transponder electronics     enabled downlink at data rates up to 1 Mbps and uplink at 16     kbps.  Following launch and LRO separation, attitude control was     passed from the Centaur to the SSC.  The attitude control system     (ACS) provided three-axis control using an inertial reference     unit (IRU; no accelerometers), a star tracker, coarse sun     sensors for emergency automated sun-relative attitude capture     and tracking, and a set of eight monopropellant 5 N thrusters.     Two additional 22 N thrusters provided orbit maneuvering     capability.  The ACS featured twelve control mode/submode     combinations, six tailored for specific operations while     attached to the Centaur, and a second set for use after Centaur     separation.  The LCROSS propellant tank contained just over 305     kg of hydrazine for both attitude control and orbit maneuvering.     The LCROSS power system featured a 368 W solar array and four 20     A-h batteries.  LCROSS performed thermal control using a     combination of resistive heaters, passive radiators, and     multi-layer insulation.       The LCROSS Payload       The LCROSS Payload consists of nine science instruments, their     supporting electrical, mechanical and optical harnesses, a     central data handling unit (DHU) assembly, and thermal hardware     (heaters, thermistors, and thermostats), all assembled onto the     LCROSS spacecraft R6 Radiator Panel.  Eight of the nine science     instruments are configured with their apertures in the +X     direction (spacecraft body frame/SBF) and are accommodated in     the Payload Observation Deck (POD).  The ninth instrument, near     infrared spectrometer #2 (NSP2), has its entrance optical     element orientated in the -Z direction (spacecraft body     frame/SBF).  The Payload is located on the inboard side of the     LCROSS spacecraft R6 Panel.       Visible Camera       The LCROSS visible camera (VIS) is a ruggedized analog video     camera from the RocketCamTM camera family developed by Ecliptic     Enterprises, Inc.  The unit consists of a camera module and a     lens.  The camera's focal plane CCD sensor is 752 [H] x 582 [V]     pixel format, operating at 30 Hz (60 fields/sec).  The flight     unit's lens is a 12 mm (focal length), f/1.2 lens providing a     30.1 degree [H] x 22.8 degree [V] (37.8 degree [Diagonal]) field-of-view.     Interlaced NTSC fields are sampled by the Data Handling Unit     (DHU) at 720 x 243 resolution resulting in a final image     resolution of 720 x 486 pixels.  Each pixel is 24-bit RGB with 8     bits per color channel.  These images are compressed using a     lossy compression algorithm performed by the Analog Devices 611     Video Codec set on 80% quality and decompressed on the ground.     The LCROSS visible camera contains no cryogenic liquids or     moving parts.  The visible camera's peak power during operation     is 2.9 W.  The visible camera has been fixed to an     auto-gain/white balance setting.       Near-Infrared Cameras       The LCROSS payload contains two near infrared (IR) (0.9-1.7 um)     cameras (NIR1/NIR2).  Each camera consists of a Goodrich Sensors     Unlimited model SU320-KTX and a CCTV lens. Each camera's focal     plane InGaAs sensor has a 320 [H] x 240 [V] pixel format.  The     25 mm, f/1.4 C-mount glass lens provides a 28.7 degree [H] x 21.7     degree [V] (36.0 degree [Diagonal]) field-of-view.  Although the     camera's native format provides 320 [H] x 240 [V] 12-bit images,     the images are converted within the camera to an analog NTSC     signal before transfer to the DHU where they are captured at 720     [H] x 486 [V].  Due to similar processing within the DHU as     needed for the VIS images, the two NIR camera images are     captured as 24-bit per pixel RGB.  Because the NIR cameras     provide grayscale images, the three RGB channels are identical     except for noise introduced in the conversion to and from     NTSC. These images are compressed in the DHU using a lossy     compression algorithm performed by the Analog Devices 611 Video     Codec set on 80% quality and decompressed on the ground.  In     addition to a camera body and a lens, near infrared camera #1     (NIR1) also contains a long-pass filter (wavelength > 1.4 um).     NIR2, in comparison, is filter-less.       Lenses for both cameras were provided by UkaOptics     (http://www.ukaoptics.com/ #2514M) as part of the standard     Goodrich package. These lenses are not optimized for the IR.     The IR throughput of the lenses has not been documented, but is     expected to be ~40%.  The near-infrared cameras contain no     cryogenic liquids or moving parts.  There is an internal     thermo-electric cooler that actively cools the InGaAs sensor.     The manufacturer default settings for this cooler are used.     Each camera's peak power during operation is 1.6 W.  Both gain     and exposure times are configurable by commands sent to the     camera.       Mid-Infrared Cameras       The LCROSS payload contains two mid-infrared (MIR) (6.0-13.5 um)     cameras (MIR1/MIR2).  Mid-infrared camera #1 (MIR1) is a     ruggedized vanadium oxide (VOx) microbolometer MIRIC TB2-30,     from Thermoteknix Ltd.  Mid-infrared camera #2 (MIR2) is model     ThermoVision Micron from Flir Systems/Indigo Operations.  Each     camera's uncooled microbolometer focal plane sensor has a 164     [H] x 128 [V] pixel format and is digitized at 14-bit     resolution.  Each camera has a 30 mm, f/1.6 lens providing a     15.0 degree [H] x 11.0 degree [V] (18.6 degree [Diagonal]) field-of-view.     MIR1 also contains a 6-10 Om bandpass filter.  MIR2 is     filter-less.  MIR1 is backfilled with dry Argon gas to prevent     degradation due to humidity for terrestrial applications and     does not contain any component volatile in vacuum.  Internal to     both MIR modules is an instrumented-motorized shutter to provide     a reference for temperature measurements.  Each camera's peak     power during operation is 1.3 W.  A camera gain, which     determines the sensitivity to temperature scenes (high gain: -20     degC < T < +150 degC, low gain: +150 degC < T < +500 degC), is     configurable with a command sent to the camera.       Total Luminance Photometer       The Total Luminance Photometer (TLP) provides visible light     (400-1000 nm) intensity data at a 1000 Hz sampling rate.  The     TLP instrument consists of two elements: (1) the Sensor     Electronics Module (SEM), which contains the optics and sensor     assembly and signal filtering, and (2) the Digital Electronics     Module (DEM), which converts the analog sensor signal to a     digital output, as well as higher order functionality.  The DEM     is a commercial package that was modified for LCROSS.  This     instrument is designed and manufactured by NASA Ames Research     Center.  The optics in the SEM delivers an unobstructed ~10     degree diameter field-of-view.  The TLP's sensor element is an     uncooled Advanced Photonix, Inc.  (API) avalanche photo diode     (APD) packaged in a dryair sensor container that can operate in     a vacuum.  The TLP SEM is connected by an electrical harness to     the TLP DEM.  The SEM and DEM are located within the Payload     Observation Deck (POD) and on the R6 Panel, respectively.  The     DEM is interfaced with the DHU (also on the R6 Panel) via a     second cable, from which it is controlled.  The SEM and DEM's     peak power during operation are 2.5 W and 12.0 W, respectively.       Visible Spectrometer       The LCROSS visible spectrometer (VSP) is a modified-commercial     model from Ocean Optics Ltd., with its core operation based on     their COTS QE65000 model.  It has been adapted for space use and     is of similar design to a recently delivered spectrometer to Los     Alamos for a Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) payload for launch in     2011.  The VSP spectrometer design consists of an FC optical     fiber input (0.11 NA) feeding a 25 micron x 1 mm entrance slit,     where light is diffracted by a 1-inch f/4 optical cross     Czerny-Turner spectrometer (grating 600 lines/mm, blazed at 350     nm) with an oversized camera mirror.  The ~263-650 nm spectrum     from the slit is imaged onto a 1044 x 64 pixel Hamamatsu CCD     detector.  The data is co-added within the spectrometer,     delivering a 16- bit, 1 x 1044 pixel spectra to the DHU     electronics for packaging.  The first 1024 pixels contain     spectral data.  The remaining 20 pixels contain provide     temporally coincident but off-slit dark reference pixels.  The     VSP resolving power is R~300, 500, and 850 at 300, 400 and 600     nm, respectively.  The VSP contains no moving parts.  The CCD     detector is cooled by an internal Thermoelectric Cooler (TEC),     whose set point is programmable.  The VSP power is 4.8 W (TEC     off), and can reach 11.8 W (at TEC setting -10 degC at operating     temperature +19-20 degC).  Integration time (between 8 ms and 65.5     s) is configurable.  Additionally, the VSP supports two     operation modes - single and bracket spectra.  The former is a     single spectra acquisition of the appropriate requested     integration time.  The latter is a three-spectra acquisition     defined by a base integration time and a multiplier that is     divided or multiplied by the base integration time to yield a     shorter or longer exposure time, respectively.  The VSP is fed     by a 75 cm length 600-micron core-diameter UV/Vis glass fiber     attached to a fore-optics unit in the POD.  This fore-optics     unit (see below) is a fixed two-mirror and one lens system     designed to provide a one degree diameter field-of-view.       Near-Infrared Spectrometers       The LCROSS payload contains two near-infrared spectrometers     (NSP1/NSP2), located on the R6 Panel.  Their electronics units     are identical, but they have different fore-optics designs.     Near infrared spectrometer #1, NSP1, also known as the nadir     NSP, is located inside the POD and its aperture is positioned in     the +X direction (spacecraft body frame/SBF).  Near infrared     spectrometer #2, NSP2, also known as the solar-viewer or     occultation NSP, has its wide-field aperture centered along the     -Z direction (spacecraft body frame/SBF).  Both spectrometers     provide 1.20-2.45 um spectral coverage and nominal resolution     0.035 um/pixel, yielding resolving powers R ~ 37-65 (NSP1) and R     ~ 36-77 (NSP2).  Both spectrometers are manufactured by     Polychromix, a company whose primary spectrometer line is     designed for material analysis and chemical sensing.  The     spectrometers are designed to take a single SMA NA=0.22 fiber as     input instead of a slit, whose diameter defines the instrument     resolution.  Since each spectrometer contains a single     TEC-cooled InGaAs sensor element, a 1D-spectrum is created using     an innovative electronically-tunable MEMS device that spatially     masks the dispersed spectrum within the instrument.  This series     of masks undergoes a digital transform on the ground to recreate     the spectral information.  The spectrometer contains no moving     parts (excluding the MEMS chip) and the peak power for each NSP     is 2.5 W.  NSP1 and NSP2 are each fed by a single 600-micron     core-diameter low-OH glass fiber of length 75 cm and 1.45 m,     respectively, attached to a fore-optic.  The NSP1 fore-optics     unit (see below) is located within the POD and is a fixed     two-mirror and one lens system designed to provide 1 degree     diameter field-of-view.  The NSP2 fore-optic (see below) is a     diffuser providing ~130 degree fieldof- view, and is located external     to the POD housing.  Both spectrometers have three modes, Impact     Flash (IF), Hadamard Spectrum (HS) and Diagnostic Mode (DM),     which are configurable by sending a command to the units.       Fore-Optics and Fibers       The LCROSS payload contains two fore-optic units and three     fibers.  The three single-core fibers connect the electrical     units of the three LCROSS spectrometers to their respective     fore-optics (i.e., light-gathering optics).  All fibers are     manufactured by Fiberguide Industries.  The two fore-optics, a     dual-scope fore-optic feeding the NSP1 and VSP spectrometers and     a diffuser fore-optic feeding the NSP2 spectrometer, have been     designed specifically for the LCROSS mission by Aurora     Technologies.  The dualscope fore-optic provides 1 degree     diameter field-of-view (per scope) and a separation between the     two scopes of < 0.1 degrees.  The diffuser fore-optic provides     an unattenuated ~130 degree field-of-view.  The fibers were chosen to     optimize for the band-pass and be compatible with the throughput     and entrance optic requirements by the spectrometers.  For the     VSP, the fiber is a 75 cm SuperguideG UV/VIS Spectral Range with     NA=0.12+/-0.02.  For the NSPs, the fibers are AnhydroguideG Low     OH fibers with NA=0.22+/-0.02, with lengths 75 cm and 145 cm for     NSP1 and NSP2, respectively.  All three fibers have 600 Om     core-diameters and are encased in a 1/8 inch (ID) stainless     steel monocoil for ruggedization.       Data Handling Unit       The LCROSS Data Handling Unit (DHU) is a ruggedized video camera     controller and data handling system based on the ruggedized     Digital Video Systems (DVS) developed by Ecliptic Enterprises,     Inc.  It captures and transmits compressed digital spectrometer,     video and photometric data telemetry (in CCSDS format) from all     nine instruments from the LCROSS science payload.  The DHU is a     single conduction-cooled chassis designed to operate as     independently as possible from its host vehicle.  In the     limiting case, DHU operation is completely self-contained except     for activation/deactivation commands that originate from the     ground.  The DHU can store up to 10 slots of Non- Volatile     Memory (NVM), which can be used for sequencing power and     operational commands to the science instruments.  The DHU     contains no moving parts, operates from the 32 V power supply by     the spacecraft power bus, and its peak power during operation is     13.5 W.  The DHU also provides the time-stamping function of all     the science instruments and itself and provides error logs for     when science data frames are dropped or corrupted due to     bandwidth or performance issues.

There are two aft axial engines, two     forward axial engines, and two tangential engines.       The communication system consists of an S-band transponder, an omni     antenna with 3-pi steradian antenna pattern for uplink and downlink,     and a medium gain antenna for downlink.  The engineering-only     downlink data rate is 300 bps and the science/engineering downlink     data rate is 3600 bps.       Command and control of the spacecraft is achieved by a simple     Command and Data Handling (C&DH) unit.  As an individual command is     uplinked to the spacecraft, the C&DH directs the command to the     appropriate subsystem.  All science and engineering data are     collected by the C&DH and then are buffered and formatted for     downlink by the C&DH.  The data are downlinked at 1800 bps     immediately and simultaneously dumped into a solid state recorder.     The data stored on the solid state recorder is downlinked 53 minutes     later.  These delayed data frames are interleaved into the real-time     data stream, yielding a total downlink rate of 3600 bps.  The     purpose of the delayed stream is to receive data acquired during     communications blackout periods and to eliminate the need for a     commandable data recorder.       The LP spacecraft clock or frame counter increments once every 2     seconds.  It is stored in a 24-bit register.  This means that the     clock will reset after about 33.5 million seconds or about once per     year.  The clock reset on January 30, 1999 at about 12:09 UTC, which     was early in the Extended Mission.       Spacecraft Coordinate System   ============================     The Trans-Lunar Injection (TLI) stage and spacecraft body     coordinate system is discussed below.  The origin of     coordinates is: a) in the separation plane between the     spacecraft and the adapter of the TLI stage; and b) at the     geometric center of the equilateral triangle defined by the     bolt holes for the separation nuts.       The Z axis is normal to the separation plane.  The +Z direction     is towards the medium gain antenna (forward) end of the     spacecraft.  The X axis is in the separation plane between the     spacecraft and the adapter of the TLI stage.  The -X direction     is parallel to the centerline of instrument boom No.  1 and     towards the Gamma Ray Spectrometer.  The Y axis is defined by     the right-hand rule.       Instrument Host Overview - DSN   ==============================     The Deep Space Network (DSN) is a telecommunications facility     managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute     of Technology for the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space     Administration (NASA).       The primary function of the DSN is to provide two-way communications     between the Earth and spacecraft exploring the solar system.  To     carry out this function it is equipped with high-power transmitters,     low-noise amplifiers and receivers, and appropriate monitoring and     control systems.       The DSN consists of three complexes situated at approximately     equally spaced longitudinal intervals around the globe at Goldstone     (near Barstow, California), Robledo (near Madrid, Spain), and     Tidbinbilla (near Canberra, Australia).  Two of the complexes are     located in the northern hemisphere while the third is in the     southern hemisphere.       Each complex includes several antennas, defined by their diameters,     construction, or operational characteristics: 70-m diameter,     standard 34-m diameter, high-efficiency 34-m diameter (HEF), and     34-m beam waveguide (BWG).  These DSN complexes, in conjunction with     telecommunications subsystems onboard planetary spacecraft,     constitute the major elements of instrumentation for radio science     investigations.       For more information see [ASMAR&RENZETTI1993].       Science Packages   ================     The Lunar Prospector spacecraft has five science instruments.  The     instruments are a Gamma Ray Spectrometer (GRS), a Neutron     Spectrometer (NS), an Alpha Particle Spectrometer (APS), a     Magnetometer (MAG), and an Electron Reflectometer (ER).  A Doppler     Gravity Experiment (DGE) uses Doppler tracking data for deriving     gravity measurements.  In addition, the spacecraft spin rate and     attitude are determined on the ground from data derived from a sun     sensor and an IR Earth/Moon limb crossing sensor.          ",,

Over a one-Earth-year period, periapsis will precess over a wide range of latitude and local time, while MAVEN obtains detailed measurements of the upper atmosphere, ionosphere, planetary corona, solar wind, interplanetary/Mars magnetic fields, solar EUV and solar energetic particles, thus defining the interactions between the Sun and Mars.  MAVEN will explore down to the homopause during a series of five 5-day “deep dip” campaigns for which periapsis will be lowered to an atmospheric density of 2 kg/km3 (~125 km altitude) in order to sample the transition from the collisional lower atmosphere to the collisionless upper atmosphere.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument_host:spacecraft.mer1,MARS EXPLORATION ROVER 1,MARS EXPLORATION ROVER 1,"     Instrument Host Overview   ========================     For most Mars Exploration Rover (MER) experiments, data were     collected by instruments on the spacecraft.  Those data were then     relayed directly to stations of the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN)     on Earth or indirectly using the Mars orbiters Mars Global Surveyor     (MGS) or 2001 Mars Odyssey (ODY).  MER Radio Science observations     required that DSN and/or ODY hardware also participate in data     acquisition.  The following sections provide an overview first of     the MER spacecraft, then of the DSN ground system, and finally of     2001 Mars Odyssey as each supported MER science activities.       Instrument Host Overview - Rover   ================================     The Mars Exploration Rover (MER) mission sent two identical     spacecraft to two different landing sites on Mars.  The hardware on     the first spacecraft is referred to as MER-2 (the rover named     Spirit which was sent to Gusev Crater), and the hardware on     the second spacecraft is referred to as MER-1 (the rover named     Opportunity sent to Meridiani Planum).  The spacecraft design owed a     lot of its heritage to the Mars Pathfinder configuration for cruise     and entry, descent, and landing.  For more detailed information on     the MER spacecraft, see [CRISPETAL2003].         Spacecraft Configuration for Entry, Descent, and Landing     --------------------------------------------------------       After separation from the cruise stage, the 840 kg entry vehicle       consisted of a backshell and heatshield enclosing the lander.  The       550 kg lander had a tetrahedral structure that the air bags were       deployed from and surrounded, and that housed the gas generators       for the airbags, the RADAR altimeter, motors for the unfolding of       the tetrahedron's four sides or 'petals,' and the rover lift       mechanism for standing up the rover.  On route to Mars, the rover       was stowed within the lander, and contained most of the power,       computing, and communication electronics for all phases of the       mission.  The backshell and heatshield provided thermal protection       from the hyperbolic entry into the Martian atmosphere through the       use of ablating materials.  Mounted inside the backshell was the       parachute, the deceleration and transverse impulse solid       rocket (TIRS) motors, a backshell inertial measurement unit, and       thermal batteries for the entry and descent phase.  The Entry,       Descent, and Landing camera was mounted on the lander radar       bracket.  The Descent Image Motion Estimation Subsystem (DIMES)       gathered the results of a real-time image correlation of surface       features contained in three successive Entry, Descent, and Landing       camera images of the Martian surface to compute the horizontal       velocity of the descending vehicle. TIRS used this horizontal       velocity measurement along with measurements of the attitude of       the backshell to compute a TIRS rocket firing solution.         Rover on the Surface of Mars     ----------------------------       After landing, the instrument host for each spacecraft is just the       rover itself, which is a 6-wheeled drive, 4-wheel-steered vehicle       180 kg in mass, including the science package.  At its wheel base,       the rover is approximately 141 cm long and 122 cm wide.  At the       height of the solar panel, the rover is approximately 225 cm wide       by 151 cm long.  In its deployed configuration with the Pancam       Mast Assembly (PMA) deployed, the rover is 154 cm tall.         The rocker bogie suspension system gave the rover the ability to       drive over obstacles approximately one wheel diameter (26 cm) in       size while providing a stable platform for instrument       measurements.  The distribution of mass of the vehicle allowed the       vehicle to be stable even at a 45 degree tilt.  Each wheel and       steering degree of freedom was independently actuated, which       allowed the vehicle to turn in place (turning diameter 1.9 m), to       skid steer to a tighter angle (turning diameter as small       as 0.9 m), to turn in gradual arcs, or to drag wheels that       effectively trench the Martian regolith.  When moving on flat       terrain, the vehicle could achieve a top speed of 5 cm/s.  Under       autonomous control using its hazard avoidance system, the rover       drove with an average speed of about 1 cm/sec.         The rover was powered by a combination of solar arrays and       rechargeable batteries.  The solar panel provides 30 strings of       triple junction cells (gallium indium phosphorus, gallium       arsenide, and germanium) covering 1.3 square meters, which       produced about 800 to 900 W hours per sol at the beginning of the       MER mission.  Each rover had two reference solar cells, one that       measures short circuit current and another that measures open       circuit voltage.  Due to the change in season from late southern       summer to early southern autumn, and the degradation in       performance due to dust deposition, the energy produced by this       array dropped to about 600 W h per sol, 90 sols after landing.       Energy was stored in two 8 A h lithium ion rechargeable batteries       to provide over 400 W h of energy to support rover peak power       operations and provide auxiliary heating and operations overnight.         Temperature-sensitive electronics were housed in the rover warm       electronics box (WEB) which is a box built with honeycomb       composite material and insulated with 2.5 cm of opacified aerogel.       A combination of radioisotope heater units, waste heat from       electronics, and auxiliary heating by survival heaters ensured       that the internal electronics were maintained between -40 and +50       degrees C as the external Mars environment cycle ranged from 0 to       -97 degrees C.  Survival heating in the WEB requires not more than       100 W h of energy during the coldest environment conditions.  The       rechargeable batteries housed in the WEB supplied this energy.         The rover received commands and transmitted data to the Earth       through two distinct systems: a direct-to-Earth X-band system       supported by both a low-gain antenna and a steerable high-gain       antenna (HGA), and a UHF system supported by a monopole antenna       which enables relay communication to orbiters at Mars.  Early in       the surface mission, the X-band system through the high-gain       antenna supported up to 28.8 kbps to a 70 m Deep Space Network       (DSN) station.  Commands were received through the high-gain       antenna at a rate of up to 2000 bps.  The X-band system through       the low-gain antenna provided a minimum capability of transmitting       telemetry at 40 bps and receiving commands at 40 bps throughout       the MER missions.  The UHF system supported telemetry rates of up       to 256 kbps during orbiter passes which lasted up to 8 minutes       each.  The UHF system also supported a command receipt capability       of 8 kbps through Odyssey only.         The computing, command, and data handling functions of the rover       were supported by a 20 MHz 32-bit RAD6000 processor housed in a       Versa Module Europa (VME) card cage.  This radiation hardened       processor had access to 128 Mbytes of DRAM and 256 Mbytes of       nonvolatile flash memory that supported a multiprocess C-coded       software architecture.  This system, supported by auxiliary       processing functions housed on boards within the VME card cage,       had the capability to acquire images from pairs of cameras, drive       up to 10 motors simultaneously from 35 motors located on the       vehicle, and process data from three spectrometers.  The       multiprocess architecture allowed communication, image       acquisition, and operation of payload elements to proceed       simultaneously.         During the surface mission, the rovers communicated on X-band       typically once a day, reporting on status and the results of the       execution of commands transmitted that day.  Data were also       relayed through the UHF communication system to the Mars Global       Surveyor and Mars Odyssey orbiters.  Useful over-flights by these       orbiters at the landing site occurred as frequently as twice       per day per orbiter.         Each rover carried the Athena Science Payload consisting of two       remote sensing instruments that viewed the terrain from the top of       a mast 154 cm above the ground, four devices for in-situ analysis       on the end of a robotic arm and several magnets and calibration       targets.  [SQUYRESETAL2003] describes this payload, the mast, the       robotic arm, and the plans for science investigation in more       detail.  Azimuth and elevation actuators permitted the collection       of data sets for specific targets, regions, or full 360-degree       panoramas from the mast instruments, which are the stereo       multispectral Panoramic Camera (Pancam) and Miniature Thermal       Emission Spectrometer (Mini-TES).  The five degree-of-freedom       robotic arm positioned the following devices on rocks and soils       for in-situ analysis or rock abrasion: Alpha Particle X-ray       Spectrometer (APXS), Moessbauer Spectrometer (MB), Microscopic       Imager (MI), and Rock Abrasion Tool (RAT).         In addition, the stereo navigation cameras (Navcams) mounted on       the top of the mast and the stereo hazard detection cameras       (Hazcams) pointed towards the ground beneath the solar panels in       the front and rear of the rover were required for engineering       purposes (rover navigation, hazard avoidance, and safe movement       purposes and positioning of the robotic arm), but were also used       for science analysis [MAKIETAL2003].  [ARVIDSONETAL2003] provides       more detail on the use of rover engineering sensors for assessing       terrain and soil physical properties, dust accumulation, and       other related investigations.         The MER rover coordinate frame is defined as follows:         -- +Zr axis is normal to the rover top deck plane and points down,          from the top deck toward the wheels;         -- +Xr axis is parallel to the rover top deck plane and points          from the center of the top deck toward the PMA assembly;         -- +Yr completes the right hand frame.         The origin of the MER rover 'navigation' frame is directly above       the middle wheels, as shown in the diagram below.  A separate       MER rover 'mechanical' frame has its origin 29 cm toward the       front wheels (in the +Xr direction) but is otherwise identical.

Most spacecraft systems were redundant     in order to provide backup should a device fail.  In addition     to transmitting data collected by ODY instruments and systems,     the telecommunications system was used to relay data from Mars     surface assets and measure their relative motion radiometrically     in the 400 MHz frequency range.

Energy was stored in two 8 A h lithium ion rechargeable batteries       to provide over 400 W h of energy to support rover peak power       operations and provide auxiliary heating and operations overnight.         Temperature-sensitive electronics were housed in the rover warm       electronics box (WEB) which is a box built with honeycomb       composite material and insulated with 2.5 cm of opacified aerogel.       A combination of radioisotope heater units, waste heat from       electronics, and auxiliary heating by survival heaters ensured       that the internal electronics were maintained between -40 and +50       degrees C as the external Mars environment cycle ranged from 0 to       -97 degrees C.  Survival heating in the WEB requires not more than       100 W h of energy during the coldest environment conditions.  The       rechargeable batteries housed in the WEB supplied this energy.         The rover received commands and transmitted data to the Earth       through two distinct systems: a direct-to-Earth X-band system       supported by both a low-gain antenna and a steerable high-gain       antenna (HGA), and a UHF system supported by a monopole antenna       which enables relay communication to orbiters at Mars.  Early in       the surface mission, the X-band system through the high-gain       antenna supported up to 28.8 kbps to a 70 m Deep Space Network       (DSN) station.  Commands were received through the high-gain       antenna at a rate of up to 2000 bps.  The X-band system through       the low-gain antenna provided a minimum capability of transmitting       telemetry at 40 bps and receiving commands at 40 bps throughout       the MER missions.  The UHF system supported telemetry rates of up       to 256 kbps during orbiter passes which lasted up to 8 minutes       each.  The UHF system also supported a command receipt capability       of 8 kbps through Odyssey only.         The computing, command, and data handling functions of the rover       were supported by a 20 MHz 32-bit RAD6000 processor housed in a       Versa Module Europa (VME) card cage.  This radiation hardened       processor had access to 128 Mbytes of DRAM and 256 Mbytes of       nonvolatile flash memory that supported a multiprocess C-coded       software architecture.  This system, supported by auxiliary       processing functions housed on boards within the VME card cage,       had the capability to acquire images from pairs of cameras, drive       up to 10 motors simultaneously from 35 motors located on the       vehicle, and process data from three spectrometers.  The       multiprocess architecture allowed communication, image       acquisition, and operation of payload elements to proceed       simultaneously.         During the surface mission, the rovers communicated on X-band       typically once a day, reporting on status and the results of the       execution of commands transmitted that day.  Data were also       relayed through the UHF communication system to the Mars Global       Surveyor and Mars Odyssey orbiters.  Useful over-flights by these       orbiters at the landing site occurred as frequently as twice       per day per orbiter.         Each rover carried the Athena Science Payload consisting of two       remote sensing instruments that viewed the terrain from the top of       a mast 154 cm above the ground, four devices for in-situ analysis       on the end of a robotic arm and several magnets and calibration       targets.  [SQUYRESETAL2003] describes this payload, the mast, the       robotic arm, and the plans for science investigation in more       detail.  Azimuth and elevation actuators permitted the collection       of data sets for specific targets, regions, or full 360-degree       panoramas from the mast instruments, which are the stereo       multispectral Panoramic Camera (Pancam) and Miniature Thermal       Emission Spectrometer (Mini-TES).  The five degree-of-freedom       robotic arm positioned the following devices on rocks and soils       for in-situ analysis or rock abrasion: Alpha Particle X-ray       Spectrometer (APXS), Moessbauer Spectrometer (MB), Microscopic       Imager (MI), and Rock Abrasion Tool (RAT).         In addition, the stereo navigation cameras (Navcams) mounted on       the top of the mast and the stereo hazard detection cameras       (Hazcams) pointed towards the ground beneath the solar panels in       the front and rear of the rover were required for engineering       purposes (rover navigation, hazard avoidance, and safe movement       purposes and positioning of the robotic arm), but were also used       for science analysis [MAKIETAL2003].  [ARVIDSONETAL2003] provides       more detail on the use of rover engineering sensors for assessing       terrain and soil physical properties, dust accumulation, and       other related investigations.         The MER rover coordinate frame is defined as follows:         -- +Zr axis is normal to the rover top deck plane and points down,          from the top deck toward the wheels;         -- +Xr axis is parallel to the rover top deck plane and points          from the center of the top deck toward the PMA assembly;         -- +Yr completes the right hand frame.         The origin of the MER rover 'navigation' frame is directly above       the middle wheels, as shown in the diagram below.  A separate       MER rover 'mechanical' frame has its origin 29 cm toward the       front wheels (in the +Xr direction) but is otherwise identical.

The primary function of the DSN is to provide two-way     communications between the Earth and spacecraft exploring the     solar system.  To carry out this function it is equipped with     high-power transmitters, low-noise amplifiers and receivers,     and appropriate monitoring and control systems.       The DSN consists of three complexes situated at approximately     equally spaced longitudinal intervals around the globe at     Goldstone (near Barstow, California), Robledo (near Madrid,     Spain), and Tidbinbilla (near Canberra, Australia).  Two of     the complexes are located in the northern hemisphere while the     third is in the southern hemisphere.       Each complex includes several antennas, defined by their     diameters, construction, or operational characteristics:     70-m diameter, standard 34-m diameter, high-efficiency 34-m     diameter (HEF), and 34-m beam waveguide (BWG).

Instrument Host Overview - 2001 Mars Odyssey   ============================================     The 2001 Mars Odyssey (ODY) spacecraft was built by Lockheed Martin     Astronautics (LMA).  Most spacecraft systems were redundant     in order to provide backup should a device fail.  In addition     to transmitting data collected by ODY instruments and systems,     the telecommunications system was used to relay data from Mars     surface assets and measure their relative motion radiometrically     in the 400 MHz frequency range.

The initial mission      included one year orbit of Mercury which was subsequently      extended to a total of four years.

The following sections       provide an overview first of the spacecraft and then of the       DSN ground system as both supported Mars Global Surveyor       science activities.         Instrument Host Overview - Spacecraft     =====================================       The Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) spacecraft was built by       Lockheed Martin Astronautics (LMA).  The spacecraft structure       included four subassemblies: the equipment module, the       propulsion module, the solar array support structure, and the       high-gain antenna (HGA) support structure.         The equipment module housed the avionics packages and science       instruments.  Its dimensions were 1.221 x 1.221 x 0.762 meters       in X, Y, and Z, respectively.  With the exception of the       Magnetometer, all of the science instruments were bolted to       the nadir equipment deck, mounted above the equipment module on       the +Z panel.  The Mars Relay antenna was the tallest       instrument rising 1.115 meters above the nadir equipment deck.         Inside, two identical computers orchestrated almost all of       the spacecraft's flight activities.  Although only one of the       two units controlled Surveyor at any one time, identical       software ran concurrently in the backup unit in case of an       emergency.  Each computer consisted of a Marconi 1750A       microprocessor, 128 Kbytes of RAM for storage, and 20 Kbytes       of ROM that contained code to run basic survival routines in       the event that the computers experienced a reset.         Additional storage for science and spacecraft health data       was provided by two solid-state recorders with a combined       capacity of 375 megabytes.  Mars Global Surveyor was NASA's       first planetary spacecraft to use RAM exclusively (instead of       a tape recorder) for mass data storage.  This technological       improvement reduced operational complexity and cost.         The equipment module also housed three 'reaction wheels'       mounted at right angles to each other.  By transferring angular       momentum to and from the rapidly spinning reaction wheels, MGS       flight computers could control the spacecraft attitude to high       precision.  A fourth reaction wheel, mounted in a direction       skewed to the other three, provided redundancy and backup.         Sun sensors were placed at several locations about the       spacecraft.  They provided basic information on spacecraft       attitude -- namely, a rough vector toward the Sun.  Their       primary use was during attitude reinitialization after a       spacecraft anomaly.         The Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) contained gyroscopes       and accelerometers to measure angular rates and linear       accelerations.  Angular rate measurements were used to       determine yaw attitude during the Mapping Phase.  The IMU       also provided inertial attitude control, as might be       required during maneuvers.         The Mars Horizon Sensor Assembly (MHSA) determined the horizon       as seen from the spacecraft; from this, an empirical nadir       could be derived for pointing the science instruments.  The       MHSA was mounted to the +Z panel of the equipment module, next       to the science instruments.         The Celestial Sensor Assembly (CSA) complemented the IMU by       providing attitude data based on determination of positions       of known stars.  It was used during the Cruise Phase and Orbit       Insertion Phase for both attitude determination and control.       It was also used when precise attitude knowledge was required       during the Mapping Phase.  The CSA was mounted to the +Z panel       of the equipment module, next to the science instruments.         The propulsion module contained the propellant tanks, main       engines, propulsion feed system and attitude control       thrusters.  It was a rectangular box 1.063 meters on a side       and was bolted to the equipment module on the latter's -Z       panel.  The propulsion module also served as the adaptor to       the launch vehicle.         Propulsion was provided by a dual mode bi-propellant system       using nitrogen tetroxide (NTO) and hydrazine.  This dual mode       differed from conventional bi-propellant systems in that the       hydrazine was used by both the main engine and the attitude       control thrusters, rather than having separate hydrazine       tanks for each.  The main engine was the only one that used       the bi-propellant system.  The main engine maximum thrust       was 659 N.  It was used for major maneuvers including large       trajectory corrections during Cruise, Mars orbit injection       (MOI), and transfer to the Mapping orbit (TMO).         Four rocket engine modules (REM), each containing three 4.45 N       thrusters, were provided.  Each REM contained two aft-facing       thrusters and one roll control thruster.  Four of the eight       aft-facing thrusters were used for the smaller trajectory       corrections during Cruise and for Orbit Trim Maneuvers (OTM)       during Mapping; they could also be used for attitude control       during main engine burns.  Two sets of four thrusters were on       redundant strings so that one string could be isolated in the       event of a failure.  Four thrusters were provided for       attitude control.  In addition to their role during maneuvers,       the 4.45 N thrusters were also used for momentum management.         MGS carried about 385 kg of propellant; nearly 75 percent of       that was used during MOI.         Two solar arrays, each 3.53 meters long by 1.85 meters wide       provided power.  Each array was mounted close to the top of       the propulsion module on the +Y and -Y panels and near the       interface between the propulsion and equipment modules.       Including the adaptor that held the array to the propulsion       module, the tip of each array was designed to stand 4.270       meters from the side of the spacecraft.  During initial       deployment, the -Y solar array yoke was damaged leaving its       exact position and orientation in some doubt (and leading to       several changes in mission design).  Rectangular, metal       'drag flaps' were mounted to the end of each array; these       flaps increased the total surface area of the structure and       added another 0.813 meters to the overall dimensions.       Between each array and flap was mounted a magnetometer sensor.         Each array consisted of two panels, an inner and outer panel,       comprised of gallium arsenide and silicon solar cells,       respectively.  During mapping operations at Mars, the amount       of power produced by the arrays varied from a high of 980       Watts at perihelion to a low of 660 Watts at aphelion.         While in orbit around Mars, the solar arrays provided       power as MGS flew over the day side of the planet.  When       the spacecraft passed over the night side, energy flowed       from two nickel-hydrogen (NiH2) batteries, each with a       capacity of about 20 Amp-hours.  Eclipses lasted from 36 to       41 minutes per orbit; depth of battery discharge was limited       to 27% except during emergencies.         The high-gain antenna structure was also bolted to the       outside of the propulsion module.  When fully deployed, the       1.5-meter diameter antenna sat at the end of a 2-meter boom       which was mounted to the +X panel of the propulsion module.       Two rotating joints (gimbals) held the antenna to the boom       and allowed the antenna to track and point at Earth while       the science instruments observed Mars.         One of the two main functions of the HGA was to receive       command sequences sent by the flight operations       team on Earth.  During command periods, data flowed to MGS       at rates in multiples of two from 7.8125 bits per second       (emergency rate) to 500 bits per second (750 commands per       minute); the nominal rate was 125 bits per second.         The other main function of the HGA was to send data back       to Earth.  All transmissions from MGS utilized an X-band       radio link near 8.4 gigahertz.  The transmitted power was       about 25 watts.  Data rates as high as 85333 bits per second       were used.         The spacecraft was also equipped with four low-gain antennas       (LGA), two for transmit and two for receive.  The LGAs were       used in Inner Cruise, during special events such as maneuvers,       during aerobraking, and for emergency communications following       a spacecraft anomaly.         The primary transmitting low-gain antenna (LGT1) was mounted       on the traveling wave tube amplifier (TWTA) enclosure, which       was mounted on the rim of the HGA reflector; its boresight       was aligned with the HGA boresight, which was in the +X       direction until HGA deployment.  The backup (LGT2) was also       mounted on the TWTA enclosure.  LGT2 boresight was aligned       at a cant angle approximately 160 degrees away from the       shared boresights of the HGA and LGT1.  This angle was chosen       to minimize the consequences of a gimbal failure once       articulation commenced after deployment of the HGA boom in       mapping orbit.  LGT2 was not used prior to HGA deployment       because its orientation and proximity to the nadir payload       deck would lead to irradiation of the payload instruments       while the HGA was in its stowed position.  One receiving LGA       (LGR) was mounted on the -X panel of the equipment module;       the other was on the +X side of the propulsion module.         The spacecraft was equipped with an experimental Ka-band       downlink radio system.  The transmitter converted the X-band       signal to 32 Ghz and amplified it to about 0.5 watts; the       Ka-band output was radiated through the HGA.         The spacecraft +Z axis vector was normal to the nadir equipment       deck; the main engine was aimed in the -Z direction.  The -X       axis vector was in the direction of the velocity vector during       nominal Mapping (e.g., May 1999).  +X was in the direction of       the HGA boresight during Cruise, and the HGA boom was mounted to       the +X panel of the propulsion module.  The +Y axis completed an       orthogonal rectangular coordinate system.  The +/-Y axes defined       generally the deployment directions of the solar panels.  The       solar cells themselves were on the -Z sides of the panels.         There were three levels of anomaly response in the spacecraft       flight software.  The first, emergency mode, was entered in       response to a command-loss timeout.  Entry into emergency mode       reconfigured the telecom subsystem to its lowest data rate       settings to enhance the chances of successful contact from       Earth.  After a programmable period of time in emergency mode,       the spacecraft transitioneds to contingency mode.         Contingency mode was entered by four paths: failure to regain       contact with Earth while in emergency mode, power-related faults       such as gimbal faults and low battery state of charge, loss of       inertial reference, and explicit ground command.  Contingency       mode sets telecom rates to their minimum values, turneds off       non-essential power loads (including the payload), disableds       stored sequences not explicitly specified as enabled for this       mode, and changeds the spacecraft attitude to sun-coning to       optimize power and communications.         Safe mode was the deepest level of anomaly response.  It couldan be       be entered by three paths: failures of key spacecraft components       that could cannot be corrected by normal fault protection, power-on       reset of both Spacecraft Control Processors (SCPs), or explicit       ground command.  The response to safe mode entry was similar to       that of contingency mode.  Safe mode program code for the SCP was       executed from Programmable Read-Only-Memory (PROM).

Instrument Host Overview - DSN     ==============================       The Deep Space Network is a telecommunications facility managed       by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of       Technology for the U.S.  National Aeronautics and Space       Administration (NASA).

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument_host:spacecraft.mo,MARS OBSERVER,MARS OBSERVER,"         Mars Observer was launched September 25, 1992 from Cape Canaveral     on a Titan III built by Martin Marietta Corporation, with an     upper Transfer Orbit Stage from Orbital Sciences Corporation.     Flight controllers lost contact with the spacecraft on August     21, 1993, effectively terminating the mission.       For most Mars Observer experiments, data were to be collected by     instruments on the spacecraft.  Those data were then to be     relayed via the telemetry system to stations of the NASA Deep     Space Network (DSN) on the ground.  Radio Science experiments     (such as radio tracking of the spacecraft and bistatic radio     scattering experiments) required that DSN hardware also     participate in data acquisition.  The following sections provide     an overview first of the spacecraft and then of the DSN ground     system as both supported Mars Observer science activities.       Instrument Host Overview - Spacecraft     =====================================         The Mars Observer spacecraft provided a stabilized,       nadir-oriented platform for continuous observations of Mars by       an advanced set of science instruments.However, communication       with the spacecraft was lost three days before it was scheduled       to enter Mars orbit in late August 1993.  Only data from       Earth-Mars cruise and a very small amount of distant-encounter       Mars data were obtained from Mars Observer.         The spacecraft contract was originally won by the RCA       Astro-Space Division (ASD), which subsequently became the       General Electric Astro-Space Division when the two companies       merged.  The selection of RCA was intended to make maximum use       of existing designs and technologies from DMSP/TIROS weather       satellites and Satcom-K communication satellites.  General       Electric sold ASD to Martin Marietta Corporation at about the       time Mars Observer was launched; Martin Marietta was the prime       contractor when the spacecraft was lost.         The dimensions of the rectangular bus were 2.1 x 1.5 x 1.1 m in       the x-y-z dimensions.  When fully deployed, the six-panel solar       array was 7.0 x 3.7 meters, and would have developed over a       kilowatt of power at Mars.  The mass of the spacecraft was       about 1028 kg, including 166 kg of payload but excluding the       approximately 1346 kg of propellant required, most of which was       intended for orbit insertion and orbit circularization at Mars.       The propellant also included 63 kg of hydrazine, which would       have been used for spacecraft control during mapping.         At launch (25 September 1992), the solar panels and high-gain       antenna were folded against the rectangular bus and the two       science booms (Magnetometer and Gamma-Ray Spectrometer) were       retracted.  During early cruise the partially-deployed       spacecraft was stabilized in a controlled 0.01-rpm roll about       the y-axis; communications were conducted with Earth via a       low-gain antenna.  For trajectory correction and orbit       insertion maneuvers the spacecraft was oriented under three-       axis control and then returned to cruise attitude.         In its mapping orbit, Mars Observer was to be controlled in       three axes, using its horizon sensors to point the science       instruments on the +Z face toward the nadir.  The six-panel       solar-array was to be fully deployed on a boom to track the Sun       during each orbit, and the high-gain antenna boom was to be       fully deployed to track the Earth around each orbit.         Spacecraft pointing control was provided by four reaction       wheels.  Attitude information during mapping was to be provided       by a Mars horizon sensor that defined the nadir direction, a       star-mapper for inertial attitude, gyros and accelerometers for       measuring angular rates and linear accelerations, and multiple       sun sensors.  The spacecraft was required to maintain adequate       pointing control and to provide sufficient telemetry to allow       reconstruction of the pointing after each orbit.  The telemetry       stream provided data from the sensors sufficient to       characterize nadir and high-gain antenna pointing to within +/-       3 mrad (per axis, 3 sigma) and boom-mounted science instrument       pointing to within +/- 25 mrad (per axis, 3 sigma).         Two independent propulsion systems were provided.  All major       maneuvers, both in cruise and during orbit insertion, were to       be accomplished by a hypergolic, bipropellant system.  A       hydrazine system was available for orbit trim maneuvers during       the mapping period and some attitude control functions,       including unloading of the momentum wheels.  The hydrazine       thrusters were chosen to minimize contamination of the       instruments during the mapping period.         Most instruments were rigidly mounted on a nadir-pointing       spacecraft panel and, in general, provided simultaneous views       of the same nadir area.  No movable scan platform was provided;       the spacecraft was to be continuously pointed toward nadir,       rotating at the orbital rate.  Those instruments that required       scanning or multiple fields of view were constructed with       internal scanning mechanisms.  The Gamma Ray Spectrometer and       Magnetometer sensor assemblies were mounted on individual booms       on the spacecraft.  The steerable high-gain antenna (used for       radio science) was mounted on a third boom.         For more information regarding the Mars Observer spacecraft,       see [ALBEE&PALLUCONI1990]         Instrument Host Overview - DSN     ==============================       The Mars Observer Radio Science investigations utilized       instrumentation with elements both on the spacecraft and at the       NASA Deep Space Network (DSN).  Much of this is shared       equipment, being used for routine telecommunications as well as       for Radio Science.         The Deep Space Network is a telecommunications facility managed       by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of       Technology for the U.S.  National Aeronautics and Space       Administration.         The primary function of the DSN is to provide two-way       communications between the Earth and spacecraft exploring the       solar system.  To carry out this function the DSN is equipped       with high-power transmitters, low-noise amplifiers and       receivers, and appropriate monitoring and control systems.         The DSN consists of three complexes situated at approximately       equally spaced longitudinal intervals around the globe at       Goldstone (near Barstow, California), Robledo (near Madrid,       Spain), and Tidbinbilla (near Canberra, Australia).  Two of the       complexes are located in the northern hemisphere while the       third is in the southern hemisphere.         The network comprises four subnets, each of which includes one       antenna at each complex.  The four subnets are defined       according to the properties of their respective antennas: 70-m       diameter, standard 34-m diameter, high-efficiency 34-m       diameter, and 26-m diameter.         These DSN complexes, in conjunction with telecommunications       subsystems onboard planetary spacecraft, constitute the major       elements of instrumentation for radio science investigations.

An engine section in the Delta first       stage housed the Rocketdyne RS-27 main engine and two       Rocketdyne LR101-NA-11 vernier engines.  The vernier engines       provided roll control during main engine burn, and attitude       control after main engine cutoff and before second stage       separation.  The RS-27 main engine was a single start, liquid       bi-propellant rocket engine which provided approximately       894,094 N of thrust at lift off.  The first stage propellant       load (96,000 kg) consisted of RP-1 fuel (thermally stable       kerosene) and liquid oxygen as an oxidizer.  The RP-1 fuel tank       and liquid oxygen tank were separated by a center body section       that housed control electronics, ordnance sequencing equipment,       a telemetry system, and a rate gyro.  First stage thrust       augmentation was provided by nine solid-propellant Graphite       Epoxy Motors (GEMs), each fueled with 12,000 kg of       hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene solid propellant.  Each GEM       provided an average thrust of 439,796 N at lift off.  The main       engine, vernier engines, and six of the GEMs were ignited at       lift off.  The remaining three GEMs were ignited in flight.       The GEMs were jettisoned from the first stage after motor       burnout.         The interstage assembly extended from the top of the first       stage to the second stage mini-skirt.  This assembly carried       loads to the first stage, and contained an exhaust vent and six       spring driven separation rods.         The Delta II 7925 second stage propulsion system included a       restartable, liquid bi-propellant Aerojet AJ10-118K engine that       consumed Aerozine 50 fuel (a 50/50 mix of hydrazine and       asymmetric dimethyl hydrazine) and nitrogen tetroxide (N2O4).       Since Aerozine 50 and nitrogen tetroxide are hypergolic, no       catalyst or igniter in the engine thrust chamber was required.       The second stage had a total propellant load of 6000 kg and       provided a thrust of 42,000 N.  Gaseous helium was used for       pressurization, and a nitrogen cold gas jet system provided       attitude control during coast periods and roll control during       powered flight.  Hydraulically activated gimbals provided pitch       and yaw control.  The forward section of the second stage       housed the guidance and control equipment that provided       guidance sequencing and stabilization signals for both the       first and second stages.  Both first and second stages had a       battery driven DC power system.  Separate batteries were used       for the guidance and control system, ordnance, and engine       systems.  The instrumentation and flight termination system       were powered by the same battery.         The Payload Assist Module D (PAM-D) was the third stage of the       Delta II 7925 launch vehicle and provided the final velocity       required to place the Pathfinder spacecraft on a trajectory to       Mars.  The PAM-D upper stage consisted of (1) a spin table to       support, rotate, and stabilize the Pathfinder spacecraft /       PAM-D combination before separating from the second stage, (2)       a Star-48B solid rocket motor for propulsion, (3) an active       Nutation Control System (NCS) to provide stability after       spin-up of the spacecraft/PAM-D stack, (4) a 3717C payload       attach fitting to mount the Star-48B motor to the spacecraft,       and (5) a yo-yo de-spin system designed to decrease the spin       rate of the upper stage / spacecraft stack from 70 RPM to 12       +/- 2 RPM.  The Star-48B provided an average thrust of 67,168 N       and was fueled with 2000 kg of solid propellant that was       composed primarily of ammonium perchlorate and aluminum.         During launch and ascent through the sensible atmosphere, the       Pathfinder spacecraft / PAM-D upper stage combination was       protected from aerodynamic forces by a 2.9 m diameter payload       fairing.  The payload fairing was jettisoned from the launch       vehicle during second stage powered flight at a minimum       altitude of 111 km.         Flight System Description     -------------------------       The Mars Pathfinder Flight System consisted of six major       subsystems: Attitude and Information Management (AIM);       Telecommunications; Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL); Power       and Pyrotechnics; Propulsion; and Mechanical Structure.  Brief       descriptions of the subsystems are given below.         Mechanical Structure     --------------------       The Mars Pathfinder flight system was effectively three       spacecraft in one.  The flight system was a standard       interplanetary spacecraft in one mode, an atmospheric entry       vehicle in another, and a surface lander in the third.  The       major components of the spacecraft were the cruise stage, the       entry vehicle (consisting of the heatshield, backshell, and       attached hardware), and the lander (containing the rover).       Components from all other subsystems were distributed through       each of these elements.         The purpose of the lander was to provide engineering support to       the science instruments and rover during surface operations.       The landing approach employed by Mars Pathfinder required the       lander to have self righting capability.  A simple tetrahedron       design was developed to limit the possible landing       orientations.  The lander was able to right itself if it landed       on any face of the tetrahedron by driving actuators which       connected three faces of the tetrahedron (the petals) with the       fourth (the base petal).  All thermally sensitive electronics       were contained in the insulated Integrated Support Assembly       (ISA) located inside the tetrahedron.  This enclosure provided       a controlled environment to minimize the effects of the extreme       temperature variations on Mars.  The lander high gain antenna       and low gain antenna were attached to the outside of the ISA,       as was the Imager for Mars Pathfinder.  The rover was attached       to one of the side petals.         A detailed description of the entry vehicle is given in the       following EDL subsystem description.  The cruise stage was       responsible for controlling the vehicle during cruise, and was       home to most of the components required for interplanetary       flight.  These included launch vehicle separation devices;       attitude sensors; propulsive thrusters, tanks, and other       equipment; cruise antennas; and solar arrays.  The cruise stage       was jettisoned prior to entry into the Martian atmosphere and       impacted the surface.  To eliminate duplication of       capabilities, cruise stage hardware utilized key       telecommunications, attitude and information management       services, and power support from equipment that resided on the       lander.  As a result, there was a significant umbilical       extending between the lander and cruise stage.         Entry, Descent, and Landing Subsystem     -------------------------------------       The Entry, Descent, and Landing subsystem was responsible for       safely placing the lander on the surface of Mars.  In order to       do this, the velocity had to be reduced from the initial entry       velocity of 7.6 km/s to a level that limited the maximum       landing shock to less than 40 g's.  Specific components of the       system required to do this included a 2.65 meter diameter       aeroshell, accelerometers, a parachute, an incremental bridle,       retrorockets, airbags, and a radar altimeter.         The aeroshell was used to reduce the velocity of the vehicle       from 7.6 km/s to .370 km/s, removing over 99% of the initial       kinetic energy and protecting the lander against the resultant       extreme aerodynamic heating.  The heatshield was a       Viking-heritage, 70 degree half angle blunt cone.  Thermal       protection was provided by Viking-heritage SLA-561V ablative       material.  Ablative material was also applied to the backshell       to protect the lander from the effects of recirculation flow       around the entry vehicle.  During the entry and descent phases,       accelerometers on the lander provided parachute deployment       timing information and acceleration data.  A 12.7 meter       diameter Viking heritage disk-gap-band parachute was used for       terminal descent.  The parachute was designed to open at       supersonic speeds with a maximum deployment dynamic pressure of       700 N/m^2.         The EDL system also included separation devices designed to       separate the heatshield from the backshell after parachute       deployment.  The heatshield had to be separated and released       from the backshell so that the lander could be deployed on the       incremental bridle.  The incremental bridle was designed to       provide separation between the backshell-mounted retrorockets       and the lander and to improve stability during the rocket       firing.  A radar altimeter on the lander was used to determine       when to ignite the three retrorockets.  The retrorockets were       sized to bring the backshell/lander system to a complete stop       at approximately 15 m above the surface.  Four airbags attached       to the faces of the tetrahedral lander were inflated just       before the rockets fired and were designed to limit landing       loads to less than 40 Earth g's.  The airbags were inflated       using three gas generators in 1/4 of a second.  The generators       continued to maintain the pressure in the airbags for over one       minute past initial pressurization.  Just prior to contacting       the surface, cable cutters released the lander from the       parachute, backshell, and retrorockets.  The lander hit with a       vertical velocity of 12 m/s and a horizontal velocity of 6 m/s.       After ground impact and tumbling, the airbags deflated and were       retracted.  The three lander petals were then opened to       establish an upright configuration on the surface.         All of the details of the timing for the entire EDL procedure       were determined in real time on board the spacecraft.         Attitude and Information Management Subsystem     ---------------------------------------------       The AIM subsystem performed all spacecraft computing functions       including command and telemetry handling, HGA pointing, payload       data compression, cruise attitude determination and control,       and EDL timing.  This subsystem was built around a single       high-performance (20 MIPS), 32-bit, single-board R6000       computer.  The computer had 128 Mbyte of dynamic RAM for flight       software, engineering measurements, and science data.  An       additional 4 Mbytes of electronically erasable PROM was       included to hold flight software boot code, critical sequences       and data.  The speed and capabilities of this computer greatly       simplified both software development and mission operations.         Internal interfaces within AIM were implemented using a VME bus       backplane.  Major VME interfaces included the Power &       Pyrotechnics subsystem, the Reed Solomon downlink board, the       hardware command decoder, and the power converter unit.  A       Mil-Std-1553 bus served for engineering data links to remote       engineering units which collected status data from the       celestial sensors and analog telemetry channels.  Celestial       sensors included a modified Magellan/IUS star scanner and a       five head sun sensor.  The spacecraft was spin stabilized       during cruise, and maintained an Earth point profile for most       of the flight (except for portions near Earth and Mars).  The       attitude determination and control system was required to       maintain at least 2 degrees inertial pointing throughout       cruise.  Attitude determination and HGA control was required       during the surface phase.  The autonomous pointing accuracy       requirement for the HGA was 3.5 degrees (note that more       accurate pointing was possible using downlink dithering).  The       AIM was also responsible for collecting and packetizing science       data from the instruments.         Flight software in the AIM controlled the uplink interface,       downlink telemetry, instrument control, engineering / science       data collection and formatting, bus control, sequence and       command processing, attitude determination / control, and power       / pyro functions.  The flight software design was coded in 'C'.       The operating system was an adaptation of VxWorks, a       commercially-available operating system for the R6000 computer.       The operating system provided a file system and an interprocess       communications protocol for flight software components.         Telecommunications Subsystem     ----------------------------       The Telecommunications subsystem provided communications       capability during cruise, EDL and surface operations and       support for radio navigation during cruise.  The baseline       design was a direct to Earth X-band system.  There were two       major elements to this subsystem: the Radio Frequency Subsystem       (RFS) and the Antenna Subsystem.  All RFS components were       located in the lander ISA.  Primary RFS functions were       performed by a single string Cassini transponder, a 13 watt       (RF) Solid State Power Amplifier, a newly developed Telemetry       Modulation Unit, and a Cassini Command Decoder Unit.  This       single string approach was designed to work for the duration of       the short Pathfinder mission, however, a partially redundant       backup downlink capability was also provided.  This backup       system included a small X-band transmitter with an integrated 5       W (RF) power amplifier and an additional TMU.  This backup       provided significantly less performance than the primary       system, but was designed to be sufficient to satisfy the       primary mission objectives in an emergency.         The Antenna Subsystem consisted of five antennas for cruise,       EDL and surface operations.  A waveguide connected the RFS in       the lander to a medium gain antenna (MGA) located on the cruise       stage.  A medium gain antenna was required to maintain a       minimum 20 b/s link through cruise.  The MGA was a standard       Mars Observer design.  Two antennas were provided for EDL       communications.  The backshell LGA was used during entry and       early parachute descent.  The EDL LGA was a whip antenna       attached to the top of the lander and was used during the final       portion of parachute descent.  Two antennas were provided on       the lander.  The principal antenna was a steerable high gain       antenna mounted on the ISA.  The HGA was a mechanically-steered       slotted plate with 2 degrees of freedom in pointing.  It       provided a nominal 125 b/s command uplink rate and a telemetry       downlink rate of approximately 600 b/s into a DSN 34-m antenna       (or 2700 b/s into a 70-m antenna).  These data rate       capabilities assumed 3.5 degrees pointing of the HGA.  Improved       pointing (using a dithering scheme with the DSN) could improve       these rates.  These rates were also conservative in that they       contained a 3 dB link margin.  A Low Gain Antenna was provided       for emergency situations in the event the HGA should fail.  The       LGA provided an emergency 7.8 b/s command uplink rate and a       minimum 40 b/s downlink rate over a 60 degree beam width.         Power and Pyrotechnics Subsystem     --------------------------------       The Power and Pyrotechnics Subsystem was responsible for       generating, storing and distributing power during cruise and       surface operations.  In addition, this subsystem was       responsible for controlling and initiating all pyrotechnic       devices required for EDL and surface operations.  Power was       generated during cruise by a 4.4 m^2 Gallium Arsenide (GaAs)       solar array which covered the top surface of the cruise stage.       The 5.5 mm thick cells were arranged to prevent any single       failures from catastrophically impacting the power output.       Power was generated on the surface by 2.9 m^2 of GaAs solar       arrays mounted on the exposed surfaces of the lander petals.       The lander and cruise stage used the same 5.5 mm thick cells.         A 40 amp-hr (~1120 W-hr @ 28 V) silver zinc battery was used to       provide energy storage during the mission.  Silver zinc       batteries are typically used in primary battery applications       (like launch vehicles), but Pathfinder re-qualified the       technology for use as a rechargeable battery.  The advantage of       this type of battery is a much higher energy density than       typical NiCd or NiH batteries.  The disadvantage is a       relatively short cycle life (limited to 30-100 cycles).  The       battery was only used to support launch, trajectory correction       maneuvers (TCMs) and surface operations, however, so the cycle       capability was sufficient for primary operations.         The power distribution system used an unregulated bus       controlled by a shunt regulator.  Pyro devices were initiated       using a secondary power distribution system (isolated from the       main) to prevent ground loop problems.  Because of the rapid       firing of pyros during EDL, special thermal batteries were       included as a backup power source for the pyro system.  The       pyro system was designed to provide sufficient arm and enable       controls to satisfy all system safety requirements.         Propulsion Subsystem     --------------------       The Propulsion subsystem included all equipment needed to       perform attitude control and TCM's during cruise and Rocket       Assisted Deceleration during EDL.  The cruise stage propulsion       system consisted of four blow-down hydrazine titanium       propellant tanks connected with eight 4.45 N (1 lb) thrusters       via series latch valves.  These thrusters were arranged to       allow coupled turns and both axial and transverse translational       maneuvers.  The purpose and function of the RAD rockets are       described more fully in the EDL section above.         Mass Summary     ------------       The spacecraft launch mass was 894 kg, including the hydrazine       (N2H4) propellant, science instruments, and a free-ranging       rover surface vehicle.  The required amount of propellant was       calculated using the maximum available spacecraft launch mass       of 905 kg.  The entry mass was 584 kg.  The entry mass was a       key driver on the EDL system design, so careful margin       management was important.

This utilized elements of the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) in     addition to the instrumentation on board the spacecraft.       The Deep Space Network is a telecommunications facility managed     by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of     Technology for the U.S.  National Aeronautics and Space     Administration.       The primary function of the DSN is to provide two-way     communications between the Earth and spacecraft exploring the     solar system.  To carry out this function the DSN is equipped     with high-power transmitters, low-noise amplifiers and receivers,     and appropriate monitoring and control systems.       The DSN consists of three complexes situated at approximately     equally spaced longitudinal intervals around the globe at     Goldstone (near Barstow, California), Robledo (near Madrid,     Spain), and Tidbinbilla (near Canberra, Australia).  Two of the     complexes are located in the northern hemisphere while the third     is in the southern hemisphere.       The network comprises four subnets, each of which includes one     antenna at each complex.  The four subnets are defined according     to the properties of their respective antennas: 70-m diameter,     standard 34-m diameter, high-efficiency 34-m diameter, and 26-m     diameter.       These DSN complexes, in conjunction with telecommunications     subsystems onboard planetary spacecraft, constitute the major     elements of instrumentation for radio science investigations.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument_host:spacecraft.mpfr,MICROROVER FLIGHT EXPERIMENT,MICROROVER FLIGHT EXPERIMENT,"     Instrument Host Overview   ========================     The Microrover Flight Experiment (MFEX), also known as the 'Mars     Pathfinder Rover' and 'Sojourner', is a NASA Office of Advanced     Concepts and Technology (OACT) flight experiment for autonomous     mobile vehicle technologies.  Its primary mission was to     determine microrover performance in the poorly understood     planetary terrain of Mars.  The microrover was delivered,     integrated with the Mars Pathfinder (MPF) Lander, to Mars on July     4, 1997.  After landing, the microrover was deployed from the     lander and began a nominal 7 sol mission, which was later     extended, to conduct technology experiments such as determining     wheel-soil interactions, autonomous navigation and hazard     avoidance capabilities, and engineering characterizations     (thermal control, power generation performance, etc.).  In     addition, the microrover carried an Alpha Proton X-ray     Spectrometer (APXS) which when deployed on rocks and soil     provided element composition.  Lastly, the microrover imaged the     lander to assist in status and damage assessment.         Mechanical, Thermal, and Mobility Subsystem     -------------------------------------------       The microrover is a 6-wheeled vehicle of a rocker bogie design       which allows the traverse of obstacles a wheel diameter (13 cm)       in size.  Each wheel is independently actuated and geared       (2000:1) providing superior climbing capability in soft sand.       The front and rear wheels are independently steerable,       providing the capability for the vehicle to turn in place.  The       vehicle has a top speed of 0.4 m/min.         Microrover components not designed to survive ambient Mars       temperatures (-110 degrees Celsius during a Martian night) are       contained in the warm electronics box (WEB).  The WEB is       insulated, coated with high and low emissivity paints, and       heated with a combination of 3, 1W RHUs, resistive heating       under computer control during the day and waste heat produced       by the electronics.  This design allows the WEB to maintain       components between -40 and +40 degrees Celsius during a Martian       day.           Control and Navigation Subsystem       --------------------------------- Control is provided by an       integrated set of computing and power distribution electronics.       The computer is an 80C85 rated at 100 Kips which uses, in a 16       Kbyte page swapping fashion, 176 Kbytes of PROM and 576 Kbytes       of RAM.  The computer performs I/O to some 70 sensor channels       and services such devices as the cameras, modem, motors and       experiment electronics.         Vehicle motion control is accomplished through the on/off       switching of the drive or steering motors.  An average of motor       encoder (drive) or potentiometer (steering) readings determines       when to switch off the motors.  When motors are off, the       computer conducts a proximity and hazard detection function,       using its laser striping and camera system to determine the       presence of obstacles in its path.  The vehicle is steered       autonomously to avoid obstacles but continues to achieve the       commanded goal location.  While stopped, the computer also       updates its measurement of distance traveled and heading using       the averaged odometry and on-board gyro.  This provides an       estimate of progress to the goal location.         Power Generation and Distribution     ---------------------------------       The microrover is powered by a 0.22 sqare meter solar panel       comprised of 13 strings of 18, 5.5 mil GaAs cells each.  The       solar panel is backed up by 9 LiSOCL2 D-cell sized primary       batteries, providing up to 150 W-hr.  This combined       panel/batteries system allows microrover power users to draw up       to 30W of peak power (mid-sol) while the peak panel production       is 16 W.  The normal driving power requirement for the       microrover is 10 W.         Radio Communications     --------------------       Command and telemetry is provided by modems on the microrover       and lander.  The microrover is the link commander of this 1/2       duplex, UHF system.  During the day, the microrover regularly       requests transmission of any commands sent from Earth and       stored on the lander.  When commands are not available, the       microrover transmits any telemetry collected during the last       interval between communication sessions.  The telemetry       received by the lander from the microrover is stored and       forwarded to the earth the same as any lander telemetry.  In       addition, this communication system is used to provide a       'heartbeat' signal during vehicle driving.  While stopped, the       microrover sends a signal to the lander.  Once acknowledged by       the lander, the microrover proceeds to the next stopping point       along its traverse.         Commands for the microrover are generated and analysis of       telemetry is performed at the microrover control station, a       Silicon Graphics workstation which is a part of the MPF ground       control operation.  At the end of each sol of microrover       traverse, the camera system on the lander takes a stereo image       of the vehicle in the terrain.  Those images, portions of a       terrain panorama and supporting images from the microrover       cameras, are displayed at the control station.  The operator is       able to designate on the display points in the terrain which       will serve as goal locations for the microrover traverse.  The       coordinates of these points are transferred into a file       containing the commands for execution by the microrover on the       next sol.  In addition, the operator can use a model which,       when overlayed on the image of the vehicle, measures the       location and heading of the vehicle.  This information is also       transfered into the command file to be sent to the microrover       on the next sol to correct any navigation errors.  This command       file is incorporated into the lander command stream and is sent       by the MPF ground control to the lander, earmarked for       transmission to the microrover upon request.

Those data were then relayed     via the telemetry system to stations of the NASA Deep Space     Network (DSN) on the ground.  Radio Science observations (such     as radio tracking) required that DSN hardware also participate     in data acquisition.  The following sections provide an     overview first of the spacecraft and then of the DSN ground     system as both supported Mars Odyssey science activities.       Instrument Host Overview - Spacecraft   =====================================     The Mars Odyssey spacecraft was built by Lockheed Martin     Astronautics (LMA).  The spacecraft structure was divided into     two modules: the equipment module and the propulsion module.     The shape was not uniform, but can be approximated by     envisioning a box 2.2 x 1.7 x 2.6 meters.  The framework was     composed of aluminum and titanium.  Most spacecraft systems     were redundant in order to provide backup should a device fail.     For more information, see [JPLD-16303].       Command and Data Handling     -------------------------       This subsystem handled all computing functions for Mars       Odyssey.  It ran the flight software and controlled the       spacecraft through interface electronics.  The system was       based around a RAD6000 computer with 128 megabytes of       random access memory (RAM) and 3 megabytes non-volatile       memory, which allowed data to be maintained by the system       in the event of a power failure.  The interface       electronics were computer cards that communicated with       external peripherals.  The cards fit into the computer's       main board.  There were two identical sets of the       computer and interface electronics for back up in case       one failed.  One card was not redundant.  It was a one       gigabyte mass memory card that was used to store imaging       data.       Telecommunications     ------------------       The telecommunication subsystem was composed of two parts.       The first was a radio system that operated in the X-band       microwave frequency range.  It was used for communications       between Earth and the spacecraft.  The other system operated       in the ultra high frequency (UHF) range for communications       between future Mars landers and Odyssey.         Communication between the spacecraft and Earth occurred       through the use of three antennas.  The high-gain antenna was       a dish with 1.3 meter diameter (4.25 feet).  It was used       during the late Cruise and Science and relay phases of the       mission when data rates were high.  It simultaneously       received commands from Earth and transmitted science data to       Earth.  The medium-gain antenna was a 7.1 cm (2.8 inch) wide       rectangular horn antenna that protruded through the high-gain       dish.  The low-gain antenna was 4.4 cm (1.75 inches) and       provided wide- angle communications in emergencies or when       the high-gain antenna was not pointed directly at Earth.       Electrical Power     ----------------       A 7 square meter (75 square feet) solar panel containing an       array of gallium arsenide cells generated power for the       spacecraft.  The power distribution and drive unit sent power       to the electrical loads of the spacecraft through a system of       switches.       Guidance, Navigation and Control     --------------------------------       This subsystem used three redundant pairs of sensors to       determine the spacecraft's attitude.  A star camera was used       to look at star fields and a sun sensor detected the position       of the Sun in order to back up the star camera.  The inertial       measurement unit collected spacecraft orientation data       between star camera updates.  The reaction wheels along with       the thrusters operated to control the attitude.  There were       four reaction wheels - three primary and one for backup.       Odyssey was a three-axis stabilized spacecraft.       Propulsion     ----------       The propulsion system comprised a main engine, which aided in       placing Odyssey in orbit around Mars, and sets of small       thrusters, which performed attitude control and trajectory       correction maneuvers.  The main engine produced a thrust of       about 695 Newtons (156 pounds of force).  Each of the four       attitude controlling thrusters produced a thrust of 0.9       Newtons (0.2 pounds of force) and the four spacecraft turning       thrusters produced a force of 22 Newtons (5 pounds of force).       The propulsion system also included one gaseous helium tank       used to pressurize the fuel and oxidizer tanks, miscellaneous       tubing, pyro valves, and filters.       Structures     ----------       The spacecraft was composed of two modules - propulsion and       equipment.  The propulsion module contained tanks, thrusters,       and associated plumbing.  The equipment module consisted of       the equipment deck, which supported the Mars Radiation       Environment Experiment (MARIE), and engineering components.       The other component of the equipment module was the science       deck which housed the Thermal Emission Imaging System       (THEMIS), Gamma Ray Spectrometer (GRS), High-Energy Neutron       Detector (HEND), Neutron Spectrometer (NS), and star cameras       on top and engineering components and the GRS central       electronics box on the underside.       Thermal Control     ---------------       A combination of heaters, radiators, louvers, blankets, and       thermal coatings maintained each spacecraft component's       temperature within its allowable limits.       Mechanisms     ----------       Odyssey functioned via several mechanisms, many of which were       associated with the high-gain antenna.  The antenna was       locked down during launch, cruise, and aerobraking through       three 'retention and release devices,' or latches.  The       antenna was released and deployed with a motor-driven hinge       once the science orbit around Mars was attained. A two-axis       gimbal assembly controlled the position of the antenna. The       solar array used four latches which folded together and       locked down the panels during launch.  After deployment, a       two-axis gimbal assembly controlled the solar array.  The       last mechanism was a latch for the deployment of the 6-meter       GRS boom.       Flight Software     ---------------       Odyssey received commands from Earth via radio and then       translated them into spacecraft actions. The flight software       had the capability to run many sequences concurrently in       addition to executing received commands immediately.         The data collection software was quite flexible.  The science       and engineering data were collected and then put in a variety       of holding bins called Application Identifiers (APIDs).  Ground       commands could easily modify the data routing and sampling       frequency.         A number of autonomous spacecraft performance functions were       part of the flight software.  The spacecraft ran routines       to control attitude and orientation without commands sent       from Earth.  The software also executed fault protection       routines to determine if any internal problem occurred.  If       a problem was found, a number of automatic preset actions       would occur to resolve the problem and put the spacecraft       into a standby mode until ground controllers provided       further direction.       Coordinate System     -----------------       The spacecraft frame is defined with the X axis parallel to       the stowed HGA boresight, the Y axis normal to the stowed       solar arrays, and the Z axis in the direction of the main       engine thrust (see figure below).  The origin of the frame       is centered on the launch vehicle separation plane.                                    _______________ HGA                                  \             /               Science        ..   `._________.'

The primary function of the DSN is to provide two-way     communications between the Earth and spacecraft exploring the     solar system.  To carry out this function it is equipped with     high-power transmitters, low-noise amplifiers and receivers,     and appropriate monitoring and control systems.       The DSN consists of three complexes situated at approximately     equally spaced longitudinal intervals around the globe at     Goldstone (near Barstow, California), Robledo (near Madrid,     Spain), and Tidbinbilla (near Canberra, Australia).  Two of     the complexes are located in the Northern Hemisphere while the     third is in the Southern Hemisphere.       Each complex includes several antennas, defined by their     diameters, construction, or operational characteristics:     70-m diameter, standard 34-m diameter, high-efficiency 34-m     diameter (HEF), and 34-m beam waveguide (BWG).

Those data were then relayed directly     to stations of the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN)  on Earth or     indirectly using the Mars orbiters Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) or 2001     Mars Odyssey  (ODY). The following sections provide an overview first     of the Phoenix spacecraft, then of the DSN  ground system, and finally     of the 2001 Mars Odyssey, as each supported Phoenix science     activities.     Instrument Host Description   ===========================       The Mars Phoenix Lander was build for the canceled Mars 2000 Lander     Mission. The spacecraft  was refurbished and held as the instrument     host for the Phoenix mission [SMITHETAL2008]. Phoenix  was the first     of the Scout class mission and consisted of a single lander with     associated  instrumentation. The Lander was about 18 feet (5.5 meters)     long with the solar panels deployed, and  the science deck by itself     was about 5 feet (1.5 meters) in diameter. From the ground to the top     of the  MET mast, the Lander measured about 7 feet (2.2 meters) tall.     The Lander weighed 350 kg, or 770 lbs.  It was launched on August 4,     2007, on a Delta II 7925 launch vehicle, and was operational until     November 2, 2008, performing on the Martian surface for 152 sols.       Power was generated during the cruise stage by two gallium arsenide     solar panels (total area  3.1 m2, or 33 ft2) mounted to the cruise     stage. After touchdown, Phoenix relied on two octagonal  gallium     arsenide solar panel wings extending from the Lander base to charge     its battery for operations.  Input from the solar panels was     sufficient to power daytime operations, but nighttime operations     required additional power from the Lander heater system.       Phoenix communicated directly with Earth using the X-band portion of     the radio spectrum (8  to 12 gigahertz) throughout the launch and     cruise stages. Continuous and instantaneous  communication with the     spacecraft was maintained throughout the launch phase, switching to     communication every three days in the cruise phase.  All X-band     capability was lost once the cruise  stage was jettisoned. During the     surface mission, the landed Helix antenna on the Lander deck     communicated with DSN via the orbiters Mars Express (MRO), Mars     Odyssey (ODY), and Mars Express  (MEX) every four to eight hours.       Other Lander systems included a single RAD6000 processor, a fault     detection and correction  system for monitoring spacecraft health, a     guidance system to land the spacecraft, a propulsion  system for     touchdown, a data handling system for committing critical data to     overnight storage during  surface operations, and a heater system to     ensure the spacecraft maintained an appropriate  temperature . The     Lander served as a host for various associated instrumentation,     including six  instrument packages: the Surface Stereo Imager (SSI),     Robotic Arm (RA) and associated Icy Soil  Acquisition Device (ISAD),     the Robotic Arm Camera (RAC), the Microscopy, Electrochemistry, and     Conductivity Analyzer (MECA), the Thermal Evolved Gas Analyzer (TEGA),     and the Meteorological  Package (MET) [SMITHETAL2008].       During most of Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL), Phoenix used a UHF     antenna that wrapped around  the backshell to give it a wide field of     view (FOV) for  communications. During terminal descent (approximately     30 seconds before landing), the Lander switched to the landed Helix     antenna  and continued transmitting a UHF signal until one minute     after  landing. This wide FOV was  necessary as the geometry between     Phoenix and the orbiters MRO, ODY, and MEX  required a very wide     spread of off-boresight angles.       Following its soft touchdown between 65 deg N to 72 deg N latitude,     and after waiting 20 minutes for the dust to settle, the Lander     performed a number of critical activities. These 'Sol 0' (a sol is  a     mars day) activities included deployments of the landed solar  arrays,     the bio-barrier covering the RA, and the SSI and MET  masts. The SSI     took images of the bio-barrier, solar arrays,  and part of the footpad     and workspace. High priority EDL and Sol  0 data were saved to flash     memory within the first hour after  touchdown, after which the Lander     went to sleep to conserve  energy. The Lander woke up for 10 minutes     for the first  post-landed UHF communication pass one ODY or MRO orbit     period  (approximately 2 hours) after landing. After relaying data to     the orbiters during that first pass, the  Lander went to sleep again.     Payload heaters were on  continuously from touchdown, with Lander     heaters kicking in  around midnight for 4-5 hours of keep-alive     heating.  [GUINNETAL2008]     Lander on the Surface of Mars   =============================     The first seven sols after Landing were known as the  characterization     phase, with pre-planned activities running from  a minimum of 3 hours     on Sol 1 to a maximum of 6.5 hours on Sol 6  (the Lander was active     for up to 7 hours during the nominal surface  or digging phase). The     performance of the spacecraft's power, thermal, and UHF subsystems     were thoroughly characterized during  this phase, and TEGA, MECA, and     MET instruments went through their initial checkouts and  prepared for     nominal operations. Concurrent with  these activities, the EDL and Sol     0 data that were stored in the  non-volatile (flash memory) were     relayed to the ground. The SSI  imaged as much of the Lander as it     could see and characterized  the workspace and surrounding     environment. The  RAC located on the 'wrist' of the RA was  used to     image the footpads and the TEGA cover, as it was the only  imager that     could be maneuvered into the proper viewpoint for these  pictures.       After the Robotic Arm (RA) was checked out, the digging phase     commenced. The digging phase activities included digging a trench  in     front of the Lander, and the analysis of soil samples at  various     trench-depths by the Lander instruments. This phase  continued until     the End-of-Mission on Sol 90. Operations during  this phase were     conducted at the University of Arizona.       The Lander operated for 152 sols and achieved all scientific     objectives.     Instrument Host Overview - DSN   ==============================     The Deep Space Network is a telecommunications facility managed     by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of     Technology for the U.S.  National Aeronautics and Space     Administration (NASA).       The primary function of the DSN is to provide two-way     communications between the Earth and spacecraft exploring the     solar system.  To carry out this function it is equipped with     high-power transmitters, low-noise amplifiers and receivers,     and appropriate monitoring and control systems.       The DSN consists of three complexes situated at approximately     equally spaced longitudinal intervals around the globe at     Goldstone (near Barstow, California), Robledo (near Madrid,     Spain), and Tidbinbilla (near Canberra, Australia).  Two of     the complexes are located in the northern hemisphere while the     third is in the southern hemisphere.       Each complex includes several antennas, defined by their     diameters, construction, or operational characteristics:     70-m diameter, standard 34-m diameter, high-efficiency 34-m     diameter (HEF), and 34-m beam waveguide (BWG).       For more information see [ASMAR&RENZETTI1993].     Instrument Host Overview - 2001 Mars Odyssey   ============================================     The 2001 Mars Odyssey (ODY) spacecraft was built by Lockheed Martin     Astronautics (LMA).  Most spacecraft systems were redundant     in order to provide backup should a device fail.  In addition     to transmitting data collected by ODY instruments and systems,     the telecommunications system was used to relay data from Mars     surface assets and measure their relative motion radiometrically     in the 400 MHz frequency range.  For more information, see     [JPLD-16303].          ",,

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument_host:spacecraft.pvmp.bus,PIONEER VENUS PROBE BUS,PIONEER VENUS PROBE BUS,"       Instrument Host Overview     ========================         The spacecraft was the Bus portion of the Pioneer Venus Multiprobe        mission. On this mission four instrumented atmospheric entry Probes        were carried by this Bus to the vicinity of Venus and released for        descent through the atmosphere to the planetary surface. Investigators        emphasized the study of the structure and composition of the atmosphere        down to the surface, the nature and composition of the clouds, the        radiation field and energy exchange in the lower atmosphere, and local        information on the atmospheric circulation pattern. A sister mission,        Pioneer Venus Orbiter, placed an orbiting spacecraft around Venus 5 days        before the Probes entered the atmosphere. Simultaneous measurements by the        probes and orbiter permitted relating specific local measurements to the        general state of the planet and its environment as observed from orbit.             Platform Descriptions     =====================         The Multiprobe Bus had a total mass at launch of 875 kg, of which 585 kg        were the attached Large Probe and three Small Probes, 32 kg was hydrazine        fuel, and 290 kg was the Bus structure itself. The Bus was a 2.5 meter        diameter cylinder on top of which were mounted the Large Probe in the center        and the three Small Probes spaced 120 degrees apart around the Large Probe.        The total height of the unit from the bottom of the Bus to the top of the        large probe was 2.9 meters. Power was provided by a solar array around the        outside of the cylinder and batteries. Attitude control and knowledge was        provided by radial and aft thrusters and star sensors. Communications were        via forward and aft omnidirectional antennae and an aft medium gain horn        antenna. The bus was not equipped with heat shield or parachutes, it was only        designed to survive upper atmospheric entry. The Large Probe was designed to       be launched from the Bus by a pyrotechnic spring-separation system. The Small        Probes were held by clamps which could be released by firing explosive nuts.        The probes would then spin off the bus tangentially due to the 48 rpm rotation.        The Bus carried Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometers to study the upper atmosphere.        The total cost of building and operating the probes was $83 million.              The Probe Bus was launched on the Pioneer Venus 2 mission on 8 August 1978 at        07:33:00 UT from Cape Canaveral. There was one midcourse correction on 16 August        1978. The trip to Venus took 123 days. The Large Probe separated from the Bus on        16 November and the Small Probes on 20 November. After release of the probes the        bus was slowed slightly to fall behind the probes as they headed towards Venus. Two        Small Probes entered on the nightside, and one Small Probe and the Large Probe entered        on the dayside of the planet. The spacecraft was spin-stabilized at about 48 rpm. The        Large Probe took 1-1/2 h to descend through the atmosphere, while the three smaller        probes reached the surface of the planet 75 min after entry. The Bus portion of the        spacecraft was targeted to enter the Venusian atmosphere at a shallow entry angle and        transmit data to Earth until the Bus was destroyed by the heat of atmospheric friction        during its descent. At 20:21:52 UT on 9 December 1978 the bus entered the dayside Venus        atmosphere (200 km altitude) at 37.9 S, 290.9 E. It returned signals until reaching an        altitude of 110 km one minute later at 20:22:55 UT.          ",,

On this mission four        instrumented atmospheric entry probes were carried by a spacecraft bus        to the vicinity of Venus and released for descent through the atmosphere        to the planetary surface. Two Small Probes entered on the nightside and        a Small Probe and this Large Probe entered on the dayside of the planet.        The spacecraft Bus entered the atmosphere and obtained atmospheric        composition data until burnup. Investigations emphasized the study of the        structure and composition of the atmosphere down to the surface, the nature        and composition of the clouds, the radiation field and energy exchange in        the lower atmosphere, and local information on the atmospheric circulation        pattern.

Platform Descriptions     =====================         The Large Probe comprised a spherical pressure vessel, a forward aeroshell        heat shield, and an aft cover. The probe was 1.5 m in diameter and had a mass        of 315 kg. The pressure vessel was built of three machined titanium parts: an        aft hemisphere, a flat ring section, and a forward cap. Each section was flanged        and bolted together and sealed with O-rings and graphoil gaskets. The interior        of the pressure vessel was filled with 102 kPa of nitrogen. A pressure bottle        held nitrogen to increase the internal pressure by 41 kPa. Two beryllium shelves        held the instruments and spacecraft systems. The interior of the shell was lined        with a 2.5 cm thick Kapton blanket. An antenna protruded from the top (aft) of        the sphere. Two arms on the outside of the pressure vessel held a prism and an arm        on the opposite side held a temperature sensor. There were 14 sealed penetrations        in the pressure vessel: one for the antenna, four for electrical cables, two access        hatches and seven for instruments. Power was provided by a 40 A-hr silver-zinc battery.        Radio transmission at 2.3 GHz was powered by four 10-W amplifiers. The blunt cone-shaped        aeroshell had an ablative carbon phenolic coating as a heat-shield. A pilot chute and        mortar were mounted on the aeroshell and the main chute, held by the aft cover, was        connected to three towers on the pressure vessel. The Large Probe carried a neutral        mass spectrometer, a solar flux radiometer, an atmospheric structure experiment, a        nephelometer, a cloud particle size spectrometer, a gas chromatograph, an infrared        radiometer, and radio science experiments. The total cost of building and operating        the probes was $83 million.              The Large Probe, mounted on the Multiprobe Bus, was launched on the Pioneer Venus 2        mission on 8 August 1978 at 07:33:00 UT from Cape Canaveral. There was one midcourse        correction on 16 August 1978. The Large Probe was released from the Multiprobe Bus at        02:37:13 UT on 16 November 1978 and entered the Venus atmosphere (200 km altitude) on        9 December at 18:45:32 UT. Telemetry had been initiated 16 minutes earlier. The parachute        was deployed at approximately 18:46:21 UT and the heat shield jettisoned at an altitude        of 67 km. The parachute was jettisoned at 19:03:28 UT at an altitude of 47 km, and the        probe impacted the surface (4.4 N, 304 E) at 19:39:53 UT, at which point transmissions        ended.

They were all mounted on the Multiprobe Bus (1978-078A) and were released        on 20 November 1978. The probes were targeted for different entry points        in the Venus atmosphere, all entered on 9 December 1978. The total cost        of building and operating the Pioneer Venus probes was $83 million.            Platform Descriptions     =====================         The probe consisted of a spherical pressure vessel surrounded by a forward        conical heat shield and an afterbody. The probes had a mass of 90 kg and a        diameter of 0.8 m. The pressure vessel held all the scientific instruments        and spacecraft systems. It was made of two precisely machined flanged titanium        hemispheres joined by bolts with seals between. The seals comprised O-rings and        graphoil flat gaskets. The vessel walls were lined on the inside with Kapton        blankets and the interior was filled with 102 kPa of Xenon. The instruments were        mounted on two beryllium shelves to absorb heat. A small hemispherical antenna        protruded from the top of the pressure vessel. The pressure vessel had 7 openings,        one for the antenna, three for electrical cables, two for scientific instruments,        and one for an access hatch. There were also special diamond and sapphire windows.        The probe did not have any thrusters, once released it was on a ballistic trajectory.        The aeroshell was a 45 degree blunt cone made of titanium which used a bonded        carbon phenolic ablative coating as a heat shield. The aeroshell was permanently        attached to the pressure vessel, as was the fiberglass honeycomb afterbody. The        small probes did not have parachutes. The small probe carried an atmospheric        structure experiment, a nephelometer, a net-flux radiometer, and radio science        experiments.

The vessel walls were lined on the inside with        Kapton blankets and the interior was filled with 102 kPa of Xenon. The instruments        were mounted on two beryllium shelves to absorb heat. A small hemispherical        antenna protruded from the top of the pressure vessel. The pressure vessel had        7 openings, one for the antenna, three for electrical cables, two for scientific        instruments, and one for an access hatch. There were also special diamond and        sapphire windows. The probe did not have any thrusters, once released it was on        a ballistic trajectory. The aeroshell was a 45 degree blunt cone made of titanium        which used a bonded carbon phenolic ablative coating as a heat shield. The aeroshell        was permanently attached to the pressure vessel, as was the fiberglass honeycomb        afterbody. The small probes did not have parachutes. The small probe carried an        atmospheric structure experiment, a nephelometer, a net-flux radiometer, and radio        science experiments.              The North Probe was released from the Multiprobe Bus at 13:06:29 UT on 20 November 1978.        (All times are given in spacecraft time, Earth received time was approximately 3 minutes        later.) It was targeted for the nightside at high northern latitudes and reached Venus on        9 December 1978. The probe initiated telemetry at 18:32:55 UT and entered the atmosphere        (200 km altitude) at 18:49:40 UT. After a 53 minute descent, the probe touched down on the        surface (59.3 N, 4.8 E) at 19:42:40 UT. Signals ended at this time.                    ",,

It     has operated nearly continuously since then except for an interruption     from June 25, 1998 until October 22, 1998. Smaller unplanned interruptions     have occurred periodically, and pre-planned interruptions for routine     maintenance, calibration, and satellite control have occurred, and will     continue to occur until the conclusion of the mission.       The SOHO spacecraft is three-axis stabilized and pointed towards the     Sun with an accuracy of +/- 10 arcsec per 15 min. It consists of a     Payload Module to accommodate the instruments and a Service Module     carrying the spacecraft subsystems and solar arrays. SOHO occupies a     halo orbit at the Earth-Sun L1 Lagrangian point to obtain uninterrupted     sunlight. The design life was two years, but on-board consumables were     sufficient for at least an extra four years of operations, and the nominal     mission end is now March 2007.       Twelve instruments comprise the payload, producing a continuous stream     of data at 40 kbs, except when the solar oscillations imager     Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) operates in high-bit-rate mode,     producing 160 kbs. The high-bit-rate mode is used during scheduled     daily eight-hour periods or during dedicated campaigns. Magnetic tape     stores data between telemetry contacts with the Experiment Operations     Facility, located at NASA-GSFC. For more information, see B. Fleck, V.     Domingo, and A. I.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument_host:spacecraft.vg1,VOYAGER 1,VOYAGER 1,"     Instrument Host Overview   ========================     For most Voyager experiments, data were collected by     instruments on the spacecraft.  Those data were then relayed     via the telemetry system to stations of the NASA Deep Space     Network (DSN) on Earth.  Radio Science experiments (such as     radio occultations) required that DSN hardware also participate     in data acquisition.  The following sections provide an     overview first of the spacecraft and then of the DSN ground     system as both supported Voyager science activities.       Instrument Host Overview - Spacecraft   =====================================     The Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 spacecraft were identical and were     built by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).  With a mass of     815 kilograms, each carried its own power, propulsion, and     communications systems and its own science instruments.     Spacecraft electrical power was supplied by Radioisotope     Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs) that produced about 400 watts.     The Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS),     Computer Command Subsystem (CCS), and Flight Data Subsystem     (FDS) managed spacecraft operations.  Thrusters and gyros     provided physical propulsion and attitude control.     Communications between the spacecraft and Earth were carried     out via a high-gain radio antenna using both S-band and X-band     frequencies at data rates as high as 115.2 kilobits per second.     A Digital Tape Recorder (DTR) could save up to 500 million bits     when no Earth station was available for real-time data     transmission.  Voyager control systems could record sets of     several thousand instructions, allowing autonomous operation     for days or weeks at a time.  More information on the     spacecraft can be found in [MORRISON1982], [KOHLHASE1989], and     [JPLPD618-128].       The spacecraft itself was built around its 'bus' -- a decagonal     prism, which was about 2 meters in diameter and about 60 cm     deep.  Each of the ten sides of the bus was associated with a     'bay' containing engineering systems or science instrument     electronics.  Bay 1, for example, contained the radio     transmitter.  The High-Gain Antenna (HGA) was mounted to the     end of the bus facing Earth.  The bays were numbered 1 through     10 in a clockwise direction when viewed from Earth.  Extending     away from the bus were three booms: a science boom and scan     platform to which most instruments were mounted, a magnetometer     boom, and a boom to which the RTGs were mounted.         Spacecraft Coordinate System     ----------------------------       The centerline of the bus was the roll axis of the       spacecraft; it also served as the z-axis of the spacecraft       coordinate system with the high-gain antenna (HGA) boresight       defining the negative z-direction.  The HGA boresight was       also defined as cone angle 0 degrees and as azimuth 180       degrees, elevation 7 degrees.  The science boom, supporting       the scan platform, extended in the general direction of       positive y; this boom was also defined as being at cone angle       90 degrees, clock angle 215 degrees and at azimuth 180       degrees, elevation 97 degrees.  A boom supporting the RTGs       was mounted on the bus in generally the negative y direction.       The positive y-axis (yaw axis) of the spacecraft coordinate       system passed through Bay 3; the negative y-axis passed       through Bay 8.  The x-axis (pitch axis) was in a direction       which defined a right-handed rectangular coordinate system.       The positive x-axis was at cone angle 90 degrees, clock angle       305 degrees (azimuth 270 degrees, elevation 90 degrees).         Telecommunications Subsystem     ----------------------------       The high-gain antenna was mounted to the spacecraft bus,       pointing in the negative z-direction.  It was a parabolic       reflector 3.7 meters in diameter with a feed that permitted       simultaneous operation at both S-band (13 cm wavelength) and       X-band (3.6 cm).  The half-power full-width of the antenna       beam was 0.6 degrees at X-band and 2.3 degrees at S-band.       The Low-Gain Antenna (LGA) was mounted on the feed structure       of the HGA and radiated approximately uniformly over the       hemisphere into which the HGA pointed.         The Telecommunications Subsystem (TCS) electronics included a       redundant pair of transponders, meaning that a failed       functional unit in one transponder could be bypassed by       swapping to the redundant unit.  The TCS could transmit       science data on the X-band link at rates between 4.8 and       115.2 kilobits per second and engineering data on the S-band       link at 40 bits per second.  It could receive instructions       sent (uplinked) from ground stations at a rate of 16 bits per       second.  Commands were extracted from the uplink signal by       the Command Detector Unit (CDU) and were then sent to the       Computer Command Subsystem (CCS).         Spacecraft receivers were designed to lock to the uplink       signal.  Without locking, Doppler effects -- resulting from       relative motion of the spacecraft and ground station -- could       result in loss of the radio link as the frequency of the       received signal drifted.         Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem     -------------------------------------------       The Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS)       provided three-axis-stabilized control so that the spacecraft       could maintain a fixed orientation in space.  Attitude       control was accomplished using gyroscopes or by celestial       reference.  The AACS also controlled motion of the scan       platform, upon which the four 'remote sensing' instruments       were mounted.         Gyro control was used in special situations (e.g., trajectory       corrections and solar conjunctions) for periods of up to       several days.  The inertial reference unit operated with       tuned rotor gyros having an uncalibrated drift rate of less       than 0.5 degrees per hour and a calibrated drift rate of less       than 0.05 degrees per hour.         Celestial control was based on viewing the Sun (through a       sensor mounted on the high-gain antenna) and a single bright       star (through a second sensor named the Canopus Star Tracker,       after the star used most frequently as the reference).  When       the spacecraft attitude drifted by more than a small amount       from the reference objects, the AACS fired small thrusters       which returned the spacecraft to the proper orientation.  The       Sun sensor was an optical potentiometer with a cadmium       sulfide detector; its error was less than 0.01 degrees and       its limit cycle was +/-0.05 degrees.  The Canopus Star       Tracker was an image dissector tube with a cesium detector,       an error of less than 0.01 degree, and a limit cycle of       +/-0.05 degrees.         Redundant (backup) sun sensors, star trackers, and computers       were also part of the AACS.  The non-redundant portions of       the AACS were those controlling the pointing of the       instrument scan platform, which had two degrees of freedom --       elevation and azimuth (see below).         Propulsion Subsystem     --------------------       The propulsion system was part of the AACS and consisted of       16 hydrazine thrusters.  These thrusters were also used to       control the three-axis stabilization of the spacecraft.  Two       thrusters on opposite sides of the spacecraft were used to       perform positive roll turns around the +Z axis.  Two       oppositely pointed thrusters were used to perform negative       roll turns.  One thruster was used to perform positive yaw       turns (around the +Y axis) and one was used to perform       negative yaw turns.  One thruster was used to perform       positive pitch turns (around the +X axis) and one was used to       perform negative pitch turns.  A backup hydrazine system was       connected to a redundant set of eight thrusters.         Power Subsystem     ---------------       Spacecraft power was provided by three Radioisotope       Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs) mounted on a boom in the       negative y-direction.  At Launch the three RTGs converted       7000 watts of heat into 475 watts of electrical power.  RTG       electrical output decreased by about 7 watts per year because       of decay of the plutonium dioxide fissionable material and       degradation of the silicon-germanium thermocouples.  The       difference between available electrical power and the power       required to operate spacecraft subsystems was called the       'power margin.' Voyager Project guidelines required a power       margin of at least 12 watts to guard against electrical       transients and miscalculations; excess electrical power was       dissipated as heat in a shunt radiator.         Data Storage Subsystem     ----------------------       The Digital Tape Recorder (DTR) was used to store data when       real-time communications with Earth were either not possible       or not scheduled.  The DTR recorded data on eight tracks;       rates were 115.2 kilobits per second (record only), 21.6       kilobits per second (playback only), and 7.2 kilobits per       second (record and playback).  Capacity of each track was 12       images or equivalent.         Computer Command Subsystem     --------------------------       The Computer Command Subsystem (CCS) consisted of two       identical computer processors, their software algorithms, and       associated electronic hardware.  The CCS was the central       controller of the spacecraft.  During most of the Voyager       mission the two CCS computers on each spacecraft were used       non-redundantly to increase the command and processing       capability of the spacecraft.         Flight Data Subsystem     ---------------------       The Flight Data Subsystem (FDS) consisted of two       reprogrammable digital computers and associated encoding       hardware.  The FDS collected and formatted science and       engineering telemetry data for transmission to Earth.       Convolutional coding was imposed on all data transmitted from       the spacecraft.  Additionally, both Golay encoding and Reed-       Solomon encoding were available for use on spacecraft data.       Data compression was also performed within the FDS.         Science Boom     ------------       The Voyager science instrument boom carried the plasma       detector, cosmic ray detector and the low energy charged       particle detector.  The scan platform was mounted on the       science boom.         Scan Platform     -------------       Four instruments (Imaging, PhotoPolarimeter, Infra-Red       Interferometric Spectrometer, and Ultra Violet Spectrometer)       were mounted on the scan platform, which could be slewed by       motors and gears (called actuators).  Elevation of the scan       platform was measured with respect to a plane slightly offset       (by approximately 7 degrees) from the spacecraft x-z plane;       the spacecraft positive y-axis was at 97 degrees elevation       (see Spacecraft Coordinate System above).  The scan platform       azimuth reference was defined by the y-z plane, with zero       azimuth being in the negative z-direction.  Drive actuators       were controlled by fine feedback potentiometers; the error of       each was less than 0.03 degrees, and the final pointing error       of the scan platform was nominally +/-0.1 degrees (2-sigma       per axis).  Subsequent analysis by the Navigation and       Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF) at JPL has shown larger       errors during at least the Jupiter and Saturn encounters.       High rate slews were at 1 deg/sec, medium rate slews were at       0.33 deg/sec, and low rate slews were at 0.08 deg/sec.         Magnetometer Boom     -----------------       Two low-field magnetometers were mounted on a 13-meter-long       boom that was unfurled and extended automatically after       Launch.  One low-field magnetometer was mounted at the end of       the boom and a second was mounted about 3 meters from the       end.  Two high-field magnetometers were mounted at the base       of the boom.         Science Sensors     ---------------       Each Voyager spacecraft carried instrumentation to support       eleven science investigations.  Target body (or remote       sensing) instruments included:         (1) Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS)       (2) Photopolarimeter Subsystem (PPS)       (3) Infrared Radiometer Interferometer Spectrometer (IRIS)       (4) Ultraviolet Spectrometer (UVS)         Fields, waves, and particles (or in situ) sensors included:         (1) Plasma Subsystem (PLS)       (2) Low-Energy Charged Particle (LECP)       (3) Cosmic-Ray Subsystem (CRS)       (4) Magnetic Fields (MAG)       (5) Plasma Wave Subsystem (PWS)       (6) Planetary Radio Astronomy (PRA)         The Radio Science (RSS) investigation was carried out using       the on-board and ground elements of the Telecommunications       Subsystem (TCS).  More information on instrumentation for       each of the science investigations can be found elsewhere.       Instrument Host Overview - DSN   ==============================     Voyager Radio Science investigations utilized instrumentation     with elements on both the spacecraft and at ground stations of     the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN).  Much of this was shared     equipment, used for routine telecommunications as well as for     Radio Science.       The DSN is a telecommunications facility managed by the Jet     Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology     for NASA.  The primary function of the DSN is to provide     two-way communications between the Earth and spacecraft     exploring the solar system.  To carry out this function the DSN     is equipped with high-power transmitters, low-noise amplifiers     and receivers, and appropriate monitoring and control systems.       During the Voyager era the DSN consisted of three complexes     situated at approximately equally spaced longitudinal intervals     around the globe at Goldstone (near Barstow, California),     Robledo (near Madrid, Spain), and Tidbinbilla (near Canberra,     Australia).  Two of the complexes are located in the northern     hemisphere while the third is in the southern hemisphere.       The network comprised several subnets, each of which included     one antenna at each complex.  The subnets were defined     according to the properties of their respective antennas.  Over     the course of the Voyager Mission, those antennas were expanded     and improved.  Nominal dimensions at the end (and beginning) of     the Voyager Mission were: 70-m diameter (initially 64-m),     standard 34-m diameter (initially 26-m), and high-efficiency     34-m diameter (did not exist at beginning of Voyager).       Additional ground equipment was provided by the Commonwealth     Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) in     Australia, the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science     (ISAS) in Japan, and the National Radio Astronomy Observatory     (NRAO) in the United States.  For the Voyager 2 encounters with     Uranus and Neptune, the CSIRO 64-m diameter radio astronomy     antenna near Parkes (Australia) was included in the receiving     system for both telemetry and Radio Science.  For the Voyager 2     encounter with Neptune, the ISAS 64-m diameter antenna near     Usuda (Japan) was added for Radio Science and the NRAO Very     Large Array (VLA) near Socorro (New Mexico) was added for     telemetry.  The VLA consisted of 27 25-m antennas.  Parkes,     Usuda, and the VLA were integrated with the permanent stations     at Goldstone, Robledo, and Tidbinbilla by DSN personnel.

A boom supporting the RTGs       was mounted on the bus in generally the negative y direction.       The positive y-axis (yaw axis) of the spacecraft coordinate       system passed through Bay 3; the negative y-axis passed       through Bay 8.  The x-axis (pitch axis) was in a direction       which defined a right-handed rectangular coordinate system.       The positive x-axis was at cone angle 90 degrees, clock angle       305 degrees (azimuth 270 degrees, elevation 90 degrees).         Telecommunications Subsystem     ----------------------------       The high-gain antenna was mounted to the spacecraft bus,       pointing in the negative z-direction.  It was a parabolic       reflector 3.7 meters in diameter with a feed that permitted       simultaneous operation at both S-band (13 cm wavelength) and       X-band (3.6 cm).  The half-power full-width of the antenna       beam was 0.6 degrees at X-band and 2.3 degrees at S-band.       The Low-Gain Antenna (LGA) was mounted on the feed structure       of the HGA and radiated approximately uniformly over the       hemisphere into which the HGA pointed.         The Telecommunications Subsystem (TCS) electronics included a       redundant pair of transponders, meaning that a failed       functional unit in one transponder could be bypassed by       swapping to the redundant unit.  The TCS could transmit       science data on the X-band link at rates between 4.8 and       115.2 kilobits per second and engineering data on the S-band       link at 40 bits per second.  It could receive instructions       sent (uplinked) from ground stations at a rate of 16 bits per       second.  Commands were extracted from the uplink signal by       the Command Detector Unit (CDU) and were then sent to the       Computer Command Subsystem (CCS).         Spacecraft receivers were designed to lock to the uplink       signal.  Without locking, Doppler effects -- resulting from       relative motion of the spacecraft and ground station -- could       result in loss of the radio link as the frequency of the       received signal drifted.  Unfortunately, a series of failures       in the Voyager 2 receivers left that transponder unable to       track the uplink signal.  Beginning in April 1978, Doppler       shifts were predicted and the uplink carrier was tuned so       that Voyager 2 would see what appeared to be a signal at       constant frequency (to an accuracy of 100 Hz).         Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem     -------------------------------------------       The Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS)       provided three-axis-stabilized control so that the spacecraft       could maintain a fixed orientation in space.  Attitude       control was accomplished using gyroscopes or by celestial       reference.  The AACS also controlled motion of the scan       platform, upon which the four 'remote sensing' instruments       were mounted.         Gyro control was used in special situations (e.g., trajectory       corrections and solar conjunctions) for periods of up to       several days.  The inertial reference unit operated with       tuned rotor gyros having an uncalibrated drift rate of less       than 0.5 degrees per hour and a calibrated drift rate of less       than 0.05 degrees per hour.         Celestial control was based on viewing the Sun (through a       sensor mounted on the high-gain antenna) and a single bright       star (through a second sensor named the Canopus Star Tracker,       after the star used most frequently as the reference).  When       the spacecraft attitude drifted by more than a small amount       from the reference objects, the AACS fired small thrusters       which returned the spacecraft to the proper orientation.  The       Sun sensor was an optical potentiometer with a cadmium       sulfide detector; its error was less than 0.01 degrees and       its limit cycle was +/-0.05 degrees.  The Canopus Star       Tracker was an image dissector tube with a cesium detector,       an error of less than 0.01 degree, and a limit cycle of       +/-0.05 degrees.         Redundant (backup) sun sensors, star trackers, and computers       were also part of the AACS.  The non-redundant portions of       the AACS were those controlling the pointing of the       instrument scan platform, which had two degrees of freedom --       elevation and azimuth (see below).         Propulsion Subsystem     --------------------       The propulsion system was part of the AACS and consisted of       16 hydrazine thrusters.  These thrusters were also used to       control the three-axis stabilization of the spacecraft.  Two       thrusters on opposite sides of the spacecraft were used to       perform positive roll turns around the +Z axis.  Two       oppositely pointed thrusters were used to perform negative       roll turns.  One thruster was used to perform positive yaw       turns (around the +Y axis) and one was used to perform       negative yaw turns.  One thruster was used to perform       positive pitch turns (around the +X axis) and one was used to       perform negative pitch turns.  A backup hydrazine system was       connected to a redundant set of eight thrusters.         Power Subsystem     ---------------       Spacecraft power was provided by three Radioisotope       Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs) mounted on a boom in the       negative y-direction.  At Launch the three RTGs converted       7000 watts of heat into 475 watts of electrical power.  RTG       electrical output decreased by about 7 watts per year because       of decay of the plutonium dioxide fissionable material and       degradation of the silicon-germanium thermocouples.  The       difference between available electrical power and the power       required to operate spacecraft subsystems was called the       'power margin.' Voyager Project guidelines required a power       margin of at least 12 watts to guard against electrical       transients and miscalculations; excess electrical power was       dissipated as heat in a shunt radiator.         Data Storage Subsystem     ----------------------       The Digital Tape Recorder (DTR) was used to store data when       real-time communications with Earth were either not possible       or not scheduled.  The DTR recorded data on eight tracks;       rates were 115.2 kilobits per second (record only), 21.6       kilobits per second (playback only), and 7.2 kilobits per       second (record and playback).  Capacity of each track was 12       images or equivalent.         Computer Command Subsystem     --------------------------       The Computer Command Subsystem (CCS) consisted of two       identical computer processors, their software algorithms, and       associated electronic hardware.  The CCS was the central       controller of the spacecraft.  During most of the Voyager       mission the two CCS computers on each spacecraft were used       non-redundantly to increase the command and processing       capability of the spacecraft.         Flight Data Subsystem     ---------------------       The Flight Data Subsystem (FDS) consisted of two       reprogrammable digital computers and associated encoding       hardware.  The FDS collected and formatted science and       engineering telemetry data for transmission to Earth.       Convolutional coding was imposed on all data transmitted from       the spacecraft.  Additionally, both Golay encoding and Reed-       Solomon encoding were available for use on spacecraft data.       Data compression was also performed within the FDS.         Science Boom     ------------       The Voyager science instrument boom carried the plasma       detector, cosmic ray detector and the low energy charged       particle detector.  The scan platform was mounted on the       science boom.         Scan Platform     -------------       Four instruments (Imaging, PhotoPolarimeter, Infra-Red       Interferometric Spectrometer, and Ultra Violet Spectrometer)       were mounted on the scan platform, which could be slewed by       motors and gears (called actuators).  Elevation of the scan       platform was measured with respect to a plane slightly offset       (by approximately 7 degrees) from the spacecraft x-z plane;       the spacecraft positive y-axis was at 97 degrees elevation       (see Spacecraft Coordinate System above).  The scan platform       azimuth reference was defined by the y-z plane, with zero       azimuth being in the negative z-direction.  Drive actuators       were controlled by fine feedback potentiometers; the error of       each was less than 0.03 degrees, and the final pointing error       of the scan platform was nominally +/-0.1 degrees (2-sigma       per axis).  Subsequent analysis by the Navigation and       Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF) at JPL has shown larger       errors during at least the Jupiter and Saturn encounters.       High rate slews of 1 deg/sec were discontinued after the       azimuth drive mechanism on Voyager 2 temporarily froze a       short time after Saturn closest approach.  The medium slew       rate was 0.33 deg/sec, and the low slew rate was 0.08       deg/sec.         Magnetometer Boom     -----------------       Two low-field magnetometers were mounted on a 13-meter-long       boom that was unfurled and extended automatically after       Launch.  One low-field magnetometer was mounted at the end of       the boom and a second was mounted about 3 meters from the       end.  Two high-field magnetometers were mounted at the base       of the boom.         Science Sensors     ---------------       Each Voyager spacecraft carried instrumentation to support       eleven science investigations.  Target body (or remote       sensing) instruments included:         (1) Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS)       (2) Photopolarimeter Subsystem (PPS)       (3) Infrared Radiometer Interferometer Spectrometer (IRIS)       (4) Ultraviolet Spectrometer (UVS)         Fields, waves, and particles (or in situ) sensors included:         (1) Plasma Subsystem (PLS)       (2) Low-Energy Charged Particle (LECP)       (3) Cosmic-Ray Subsystem (CRS)       (4) Magnetic Fields (MAG)       (5) Plasma Wave Subsystem (PWS)       (6) Planetary Radio Astronomy (PRA)         The Radio Science (RSS) investigation was carried out using       the on-board and ground elements of the Telecommunications       Subsystem (TCS).  More information on instrumentation for       each of the science investigations can be found elsewhere.       Instrument Host Overview - DSN   ==============================     Voyager Radio Science investigations utilized instrumentation     with elements on both the spacecraft and at ground stations of     the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN).  Much of this was shared     equipment, used for routine telecommunications as well as for     Radio Science.       The DSN is a telecommunications facility managed by the Jet     Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology     for NASA.  The primary function of the DSN is to provide     two-way communications between the Earth and spacecraft     exploring the solar system.  To carry out this function the DSN     is equipped with high-power transmitters, low-noise amplifiers     and receivers, and appropriate monitoring and control systems.       During the Voyager era the DSN consisted of three complexes     situated at approximately equally spaced longitudinal intervals     around the globe at Goldstone (near Barstow, California),     Robledo (near Madrid, Spain), and Tidbinbilla (near Canberra,     Australia).  Two of the complexes are located in the northern     hemisphere while the third is in the southern hemisphere.       The network comprised several subnets, each of which included     one antenna at each complex.  The subnets were defined     according to the properties of their respective antennas.  Over     the course of the Voyager Mission, those antennas were expanded     and improved.  Nominal dimensions at the end (and beginning) of     the Voyager Mission were: 70-m diameter (initially 64-m),     standard 34-m diameter (initially 26-m), and high-efficiency     34-m diameter (did not exist at beginning of Voyager).       Additional ground equipment was provided by the Commonwealth     Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) in     Australia, the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science     (ISAS) in Japan, and the National Radio Astronomy Observatory     (NRAO) in the United States.  For the Voyager 2 encounters with     Uranus and Neptune, the CSIRO 64-m diameter radio astronomy     antenna near Parkes (Australia) was included in the receiving     system for both telemetry and Radio Science.  For the Voyager 2     encounter with Neptune, the ISAS 64-m diameter antenna near     Usuda (Japan) was added for Radio Science and the NRAO Very     Large Array (VLA) near Socorro (New Mexico) was added for     telemetry.  The VLA consisted of 27 25-m antennas.  Parkes,     Usuda, and the VLA were integrated with the permanent stations     at Goldstone, Robledo, and Tidbinbilla by DSN personnel.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument_host:spacecraft.vl1,VIKING LANDER 1,VIKING LANDER 1,"         Instrument Host Overview     ========================       The two Viking Lander spacecraft were the first spacecraft to       operate successfully for an extended period of time on the       surface of Mars.  Both spacecraft operated from 1976 through       April 1980 and Viking Lander 1 (VL1) continued to operate until       November 1982.  In 1981, Viking Lander 1 was renamed the Thomas       A.  Mutch Memorial Station in honor of Tim Mutch, Lander       Imaging Team Leader and later NASA Associate Administrator for       Space Sciences.  Tim Mutch was killed in a climbing accident in       1980.         The Viking Landers were identical to each other and had the       same instrument packages.  The main lander structure was a       hexagonal prism body that housed the spacecraft computers, tape       recorder, batteries, several science instruments, and controls       for the surface sampler, thermal system, and data handling       system.  The spacecraft body was supported above the surface by       three legs, each with a curved footpad.  The legs were arranged       in a triangle pattern with two at the front of the lander and       one at the rear.  Mounted to the sides of the spacecraft were       three terminal descent engines, two propellant tanks, and the       extendible surface sampler arm and collector head.  Also       mounted on the spacecraft body were two cameras, two       radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTG) with covers,       sample entry ports for the biology, organic chemistry and       inorganic chemistry instruments, the seismometer, the       meteorology boom, a magnifying mirror, and three imaging       reference test charts.  The spacecraft had three antennas for       communications; a high-gain S-band antenna (the large disk       antenna), a low-gain S-band antenna, and a UHF antenna.  The       two S-band antennas were used to communicate with Earth,       whereas the UHF antenna communicated with the orbiters.  The       spacecraft had several redundant systems for computers,       batteries, and communication systems [Moore et al., 1987].         The lander was about 1.5 m across.  Clearance between the       spacecraft body and the surface was about 22 cm.  After landing       the spacecraft weighted about 610 kg.  Power for the spacecraft       was generated by the two RTGs in which plutonium-238 produced       about 70 watts of electric power and also charged a series of       batteries.  Excess heat from the RTGs was used to heat the       instruments and control systems in the spacecraft body [Soffen,       1977].         Science Packages     ================       Lander science packages included eight investigations.  The       imaging system included two identical facsimile cameras.  The       meteorology package was mounted on a mast and had instruments       to measure atmospheric temperature, pressure, and wind speed       and direction.  Each lander had a three-axis, short-period       seismometer to measure Mars seismic activity.  The seismometer       on VL1 failed to deploy and no data was returned from it, while       the one on VL2 operated as planned.  A X-ray fluorescence       spectrometer (XRFS) measured the inorganic elemental       composition of soils at the landing sites.  A gas chromatograph       mass spectrometer (GCMS) measured the composition of the       atmosphere and searched for organic compounds in the soils.       The biology investigation consisted of three experiments to       search for biological metabolism, growth, or photosynthesis:       carbon assimilation, labeled release of carbon-14, and gas       exchange.  The physical properties investigation used       information from many lander operations, such as sampling       activities, digging trenches, pushing rocks, forming soil       piles, and footpad penetration during landing to characterize       the properties of rocks and soils at the landing sites.  The       magnetic properties experiment was the only Viking experiment       to directly study the mineralogy of soils.  This experiment       consisted of magnets mounted on the surface sampler collector       head and on the lander deck to collect magnetic minerals.       Finally, lander communication systems were used for radio       science experiments [Snyder and Moroz, 1992].            ",,

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument_host:spacecraft.vo1,VIKING ORBITER 1,VIKING ORBITER 1,"               Online Reference: http://www-pdsimage.wr.usgs.gov/PDS/public/mapmaker/mapmkr.htm            Instrument Host Overview     ========================       The Viking spacecraft consisted of two orbiters, each with a       heat-sterilized lander within a capsule.  Together with fuel       they each weighed 3530 kg just after launch.  After landing,       their masses were about 900 kg for the orbiters and 600 kg for       each lander.         The orbiters, derived from earlier Mariner designs, were       powered by solar panels and were stabilized in three axes by       use of solar and star sensors in conjunction with attitude       control jets.  Three remote sensing science investigations       resided on the two-axis scan platform: a pair of high       resolution slow scan televison framing cameras (the Visual       Imaging Subsystem, or VIS); a near-infrared spectrometer for       atmospheric water detection (the Mars Atmosphere Water       Detector, MAWD); and a visual and thermal infrared radiometer       system (Infrared Thermal Mapper, IRTM).         The landers each carried two facsimile cameras providing stereo       views of the surface; a boom-mounted set of meteorology       instruments; an X-ray fluorescence experiment for inorganic       chemical analysis of soil; a gas chromatograph mass       spectrometer to measure the soil and atmosphere; three biology       experiments: the pyrolytic release, labeled release, and gas       exchange systems; a seismometer; a magnetic properties       experiment.  Soil physical properties experiments were carried       out using several of the abovementioned systems.  Upper       atmosphere measurements were performed using detectors on the       landers during entry through the atmosphere.  Finally, radio       science was done using transmitters and receivers on both the       orbiters and landers.  An extensible arm and scoop system on       each lander was programmable to acquire samples of soil and       rock for analysis on board the landers and to affect the local       environment for visual inspection.       Platform Descriptions     =====================         SCAN PLATFORM       -------------         The three Viking orbiter science instruments are mounted on a         scan platform that provides temperature control for them and         pointing in two axes: cone and clock.  The platform can be         rotated in cone and/or clock at rates of 0.25 or 1.0         degree/sec.  Subroutines stored in the memory of the on-board         computer can be called upon to move the platform in specified         patterns.  The nominal range of motion possible for the scan         platform is from 45 to 175 degrees cone and 80 to 310 clock;         however, there are mechanical constraints that reduce this         range.

Together with     fuel they each weighed 3530 kg just after launch. After     landing, their masses were about 900 kg for the orbiters     and 600 kg for each lander.       The orbiters, derived from earlier Mariner designs, were     powered by solar panels and were stabilized in three axes     by use of solar and star sensors in conjunction with     attitude control jets. Three remote sensing science     investigations resided on the two-axis scan platform: a     pair of high resolution slow scan televison framing cameras     (the Visual Imaging Subsystem, or VIS); a near-infrared     spectrometer for atmospheric water detection (the Mars     Atmosphere Water Detector, MAWD); and a visual and thermal     infrared radiometer system (Infrared Thermal Mapper, IRTM).       The landers each carried two facsimile cameras providing     stereo views of the surface; a boom-mounted set of     meteorology instruments; an X-ray fluorescence experiment     for inorganic chemical analysis of soil; a gas     chromatograph mass spectrometer to measure the soil and     atmosphere; three biology experiments: the pyrolytic     release, labeled release, and gas exchange systems; a     seismometer; a magnetic properties experiment. Soil     physical properties experiments were carried out using     several of the abovementioned systems. Upper atmosphere     measurements were performed using detectors on the landers     during entry through the atmosphere. Finally, radio science     was done using transmitters and receivers on both the     orbiters and landers. An extensible arm and scoop system on     each lander was programmable to acquire samples of soil and     rock for analysis on board the landers and to affect the     local environment for visual inspection.     Platform Descriptions   =====================     Platform SCAN PLATFORM     ----------------------       The three Viking orbiter science instruments are mounted on       a scan platform that provides temperature control for them       and pointing in two axes: cone and clock. The platform can       be rotated in cone and/or clock at rates of 0.25 or 1.0       degree/sec. Subroutines stored in the memory of the       on-board computer can be called upon to move the platform       in specified patterns. The nominal range of motion possible       for the scan platform is from 45 to 175 degrees cone and 80       to 310 clock; however, there are mechanical constraints       that reduce this range.
