urn:nasa:pds:context:facility:laboratory.asf,Australian Synchrotron Facility,Australian Synchrotron,"           Australian Synchrotron facility is a 3 GeV national synchrotron facility located in Clayton (southeastern suburbs) in Melbourne,           Victoria, Australia. The Australian Synchrotron is a light source facility (in contrast to a collider), which uses particle            accelerators to produce a beam of high energy electrons that are boosted to nearly the speed of light and directed into a storage            ring where they circulate for many hours. As the path of these electrons are deflected in the storage ring by either bending magnets            or insertion devices, they emit synchrotron light. The light is channelled to experimental endstations containing specialised            equipment, enabling a range of research applications including high resolution imagery that is not possible under normal laboratory            conditions.                      The Australian Synchrotron supports the research needs of Australia’s major universities and research centres, and businesses ranging            from small-to-medium enterprises to multinational companies. During 2014-15 the Australian Synchrotron supported more than 4,300            researcher visits and close to 1,000 experiments in areas such as medicine, agriculture, environment, defence, transport, advanced            manufacturing and mining.                      The electrons used to provide the synchrotron light are first produced at the electron gun, by thermionic emission from a heated metal           cathode. The emitted electrons are then accelerated to an energy of 90 keV (kilo-electron volts) by a 90 kilovolt potential applied            across the gun and make their way into the linear accelerator. The linear accelerator (or linac) uses a series of RF cavities, operating            at a frequency of 3 GHz, to accelerate the electron beam to an energy of 100 MeV, over a distance of around 15 metres. Due to the nature            of this acceleration, the beam must be separated into discrete packets, or 'bunches'. The bunching process is done at the start of the            linac, using several 'bunching' cavities. The linac can accelerate a beam once every second. Further along the linac quadrupole magnets            are used to help focus the electron beam. The booster is an electron synchrotron which takes the 100 MeV beam from the linac and            increases its energy to 3 GeV. The booster ring is 130 metres in circumference and contains a single 5-cell RF cavity (operating at 500            MHz) which provides energy to the electron beam. Acceleration of the beam is achieved by a simultaneous ramping up of the magnet strength            and cavity fields. Each ramping cycle takes approximately 1 second (for a complete ramp up and down). The storage ring is the final            destination for the accelerated electrons. It is 216 metres in circumference and consists of 14 nearly identical sectors. Each sector            consists of a straight section and an arc, with the arcs containing two dipole 'bending' magnets each. Each dipole magnet is a potential            source of synchrotron light and most straight sections can also host an insertion device, giving the possibility of 30+ beamlines at the            Australian Synchrotron. Two of the straight sections are used to host the storage ring 500 MHz RF cavities, which are essential for            replacing the energy that the beam loses through synchrotron radiation. The storage ring also contains a large number of quadrupole            and sextupole magnets used for beam focusing and chromaticity corrections. The ring is designed to hold 200 mA of stored current with a            beam lifetime of over 20 hours. The electron beam is kept within a very high vacuum at all times during the acceleration process and            within the storage ring. This vacuum is necessary as any beam collisions with gas molecules will quickly degrade the beam quality and            reduce the lifetime of the beam. The vacuum is achieved by enclosing the beam in a stainless steel pipe system, with numerous vacuum            pump systems continually working to keep the vacuum quality high. Pressure within the storage ring is typically around 10−13 bar (10 nPa).                      Each digital and analogue I/O channel is associated with a database entry in a customised distributed open source database system called            EPICS (Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System). The condition of the system is monitored and controlled by connecting            specialised GUIs to the specified database entries. There are about 115,000 database entries (also known as process variables), most of            which relate to the physical I/O. About 35,000 of these are permanently archived at intervals ranging from milliseconds to minutes. Some            high level control of the physics-related parameters of the beam is provided through MATLAB which also provides data analysis tools and an            interface with a computerised model of the accelerator. Personnel and equipment protection is achieved through the use of PLC-based systems,            which also transfer data to EPICS. The Beamlines also use EPICS as the basis for their control.                      Facility Website -- http://www.synchrotron.org.au         ",,

urn:nasa:pds:context:facility:laboratory.cls,Canadian Light Source Facility,Canadian Light Source,"           Canada's national synchrotron light source facility located at the University of Saskatoon in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.           The CLS has a third-generation 2.9 GeV storage ring, and the building occupies a footprint the size of a football field.           It opened in 2004 after a 30-year campaign by the Canadian scientific community to establish a synchrotron radiation            facility in Canada. It has expanded both its complement of beamlines and its building in two phases since opening, and its            official visitors have included Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip. As a national synchrotron facility with over 1000 individual           users, it hosts scientists from all regions of Canada and around 20 other countries. Research at the CLS has ranged from viruses           to superconductors to dinosaurs, and it has also been noted for its industrial science and its high school education programs.                      The injection system consists of a 250 MeV LINAC, a low energy transfer line, a 2.9 GeV booster synchrotron and a high energy transfer           line. The LINAC was operated for over 30 years as part of the Saskatchewan Accelerator Lab and operates at 2856 MHz. The 78m low            energy transfer line takes the electrons from the below-ground LINAC to the ground level booster in the newer CLS building, via two            vertical chicanes. The full energy 2.9 GeV booster, chosen to give high orbit stability in the storage ring, operates at 1 Hz, with an            RF frequency of 500 MHz, unsynchronised with the LINAC. This results in significant beam loss at the extraction energy.                      The storage ring cell structure has a fairly compact lattice with twelve straight sections available for injection, RF cavities and 9            sections available for insertion devices. Each cell has two bending magnets detuned to allow some dispersion in the straights – the            so-called double-bend achromat structure – and thus reduce the overall beam size. As well as the two bend magnets each cell has three            families of quadrupole magnets and two families of sextupole magnets. The ring circumference is 171m, with a straight section length            of 5.2m. The CLS is the smallest of the newer synchrotron facilities, which results in a relatively high horizontal beam emittance of            18.2 nm-rad. The CLS was also one of the first facilities to chicane two undulators in one straight section, to maximize the number            of insertion device beamlines.                      All five of the phase I X-ray beamlines use insertion devices. Four use permanent magnet undulators designed and assembled at the CLS,            including one in-vacuum undulator and one elliptically polarized undulator (EPU). The HXMA beamline uses a superconducting wiggler            built by the Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics in Novosibirsk. Phase II added two further devices including another Budker superconducting            wiggler, for the BMIT beamline. Phase III will add four more devices, filling 8 of the 9 available straight sections. Longer term development            includes the replacement of two of the phase I undulators with elliptically polarizing devices.

urn:nasa:pds:context:facility:observatory.madrid,Madrid Deep Space Communications Complex,Madrid Deep Space Communications Complex,"             The NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) comprises three Deep Space Communications Complexes (DSCCs)             spaced by approximately 120 degrees in longitude and within about 40 degrees latitude             of Earth's equator. As the Earth rotates, this configuration provides nearly continuous              coverage of spacecraft in the ecliptic -- that is, spacecraft flying to or orbiting most              solar system objects.  The Madrid Deep Space Communications Complex (MDSCC) is one of              these three DSCCs.  The first antennas at the complex became operational in the mid-1960s.                           The MDSCC includes several Deep Space Stations (DSSs, or antennas), a Signal Processing             Center (SPC), and administrative and support facilities.  Each DSCC handles several types of              data including: frequency and timing, tracking, telemetry, command, monitor, radio science,              and very long baseline interferometry. These data types support uplink (to spacecraft) or              downlink (from spacecraft) operations or passive reception.  Data received from spacecraft             are relayed via the local SPC to the Network Operations Control Center (NOCC) at the NASA             Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, CA, where they are distributed to the offices             responsible for each spacecraft.  Commands, generated in those offices, are sent via the              NOCC, SPC, and DSS to the spacecraft.                          The Madrid Deep Space Communications Complex (MDSCC) is located about 65 km west of Madrid,             near the town of Robledo de Chevala, Spain.  Under an agreement between the governments of             Spain and the United States, dated 1964-01-29, the National Institute for Aerospace              Technology (INTA) and the U.S. space agency NASA signed a contract for operation and              maintenance of the MDSCC facilities. The creation, in 1992, of the state-owned Aerospace              Engineering and Services, SA (INSA, S.A.) under INTA, allowed the concentration of these              responsibilities in the new company. INSA has disappeared and Ingeniería de Sistemas para la             Defensa de España is the company that has managed MDSCC since December 2012.         ",,

The observatory is located at 19°49'33"" N, 155°28'35"" W.                          Excerpt from (Iye et al., 2004):             Following the recommendations of the Science Council of Japan, the project was fully approved and construction              of JNLT began in 1991 April (Kogure, Kodaira 1991). A call for proposals for renaming JNLT ended up with its              new name, Subaru Telescope, after the old and familiar Japanese name for the visible star cluster Pleiades              (Kodaira 1992). Progress of the project and the instrumentation plan was critically reviewed at another international              conference held in Tokyo in 1994 (Iye, Nishimura 1995). The Subaru Telescope base facility was established at the              University of Hawaii campus in Hilo, Hawaii, in 1997 April, and more than 20 NAOJ staff relocated from the Mitaka              campus to begin work on the telescope in collaboration with local staff recruited through the Research Corporation              of the University of Hawaii. The progress of construction was reported on several occasions (Iye 1997; Kaifu 1998),              and the engineering First Light of the Subaru Telescope was achieved on 1998 December 24. Reports on First Light              observations were published in 2000 (Kaifu et al. 2000; Iye et al. 2000). An inauguration ceremony was held in              1999 September. The 9- year construction project was completed in 2000 March, and the telescope has been made              available to both Japanese and the international community of astronomers since 2000 December.
