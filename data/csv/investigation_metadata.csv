urn:esa:psa:context:investigation:mission.giotto_extended_mission,GIOTTO EXTENDED MISSION,GIOTTO EXTENDED MISSION,"         Giotto was launched on 2 July, 1985, at 11:23:16 UTC aboard an       Ariane-1. The mission reached fruition 8 months later during the       night of 13-14 March, 1986, when Giotto passed comet Halley at a       distance of less than 596 km of the nucleus, making spectacular       images of the nucleus.         Giotto was not expected to survive the passage through the cometary       dust surrounding Halley, where particles would strike the spacecraft       with an explosive force 50 times that of a bullet.  However, after       passing Halley, the spacecraft still appeared to be functioning quite       well.         It was decided to continue payload operation until the early morning       of 14 March, and to make an additional science pass during the night       of 14/15 March.  It was found that the magnetometer (MAG), the optical       probe experiment (OPE), the energetic particles analyzer (EPA), and       the particulate impact analyzer (PIA) were working nominally; the       Johnstone plasma analyzer (JPA) and the dust impact detector system had       lost some of their measuring capabilities but could still provide more       than 60% of their scientific data.  The ion mass spectrometer (IMS) had       lost one measurement channel (HERS, the high energy range spectrometer,       optimized for measurements in the outer coma), but the high intensity       spectrometer (HIS) optimized for measurements in the inner coma had       survived the encounter.  The Reme plasma analyzer (RPA) seemed to be       severely damaged;  only its electron electrostatic analyzer (EESA)       could still provide sufficient scientific data to permit determination       of electron spatial density.         In February 1990 the long process of reactivation was started, as       Giotto made its approach towards Earth.  The spacecraft had been       dormant for 4 years, had been subjected to cyclic extremes of       temperature and was in an unknown attitude, one, more over that       precluded communication via its high gain antenna (HGA).  There was       only one way to communicate with Giotto and that was via the       omni-directional low gain antenna (LGA) mounted on the top of the       spacecraft.         Once experiment checkout had been completed, the Control Centre made       preparations for directing the spacecraft towards comet       Grigg-Skjellerup. This was no ordinary maneuver, as Earth's       gravitational field was to provide the kick needed to bring Giotto       into the otherwise unreachable orbit.  At 10:00 UT on 2 July, 1990,       exactly 5 years after its launch, and with the MAG and EPA activated,       Giotto flew over Earth at an altitude of 22 000 km and made space       history once again.         After this activity, Giotto was put into its second hibernation which       would last until the spacecraft was reactivated again on 4 May, 1992       for its mission to comet P/Grigg-Skjellerup.  At that time the       spacecraft to Earth range was 219 x 10**6 km. The operations with       Giotto, who's health showed no further degradation since 1990 continued       without problems, concentrating on guiding the spacecraft as close as       possible toward its new target.         Two orbit-control maneuvers were performed:  the first on 22 May,       reducing the predicted flyby distance from 167 400 km to 510 km.  The       final maneuver was performed on July 8, reducing the expected flyby       distance to near zero.         During actual encounter phase on 10 July, 1992 there were no problems.       The science data processed in real time at European Space Operations       Centre (ESOC) provided immediate access to the cometary environment.         At 03:00 on 11 July, 1992 all experiments were switched-off.  After a       period of seven years in orbit around the Sun, Giotto operations were       officially terminated on 23 July 1992, after the completion of final       orbit adjustments and after configuring the spacecraft for its third       hibernation.         In its present trajectory course, Giotto will pass 219 000 km above the       Earth's surface on 1 July 1999, 14 years after the spacecraft's launch.       Future operation of the spacecraft is considered doubtful, partly       because the fuel remaining (4 +/- 3 kg) is insufficient for anything       more than an Earth or Moon fly-by in 1999, and partly because of the       age by then of both the spacecraft itself and the ground systems used       to support the GEM mission.

Mission phase start time: 1985-07-02       Mission phase stop time:  1985-07-02           Reactivation       ------------       In February 1990 the long process of reactivation was started, as       Giotto made its approach towards Earth.  The spacecraft had been       dormant for 4 years, had been subjected to cyclic extremes of       temperature and was in an unknown attitude, one, more over that       precluded communication via its high gain antenna (HGA).  There was       only one way to communicate with Giotto and that was via the       omni-directional low gain antenna (LGA) mounted on the top of the       spacecraft.         Two hours after the start of the reactivation activities, the NASA       Deep Space Network Station at Madrid reported acquisition of a weak       signal (-166 dBm), and about 150 hours after starting, full control       of the spacecraft was established through the HGA and Giotto again       performed beyond its design envelope.         From the spacecraft telemetry data received and analyzed, it was       evident that Giotto had survived its odyssey through space extremely       well.  A check of the payload concluded, with a high degree of       confidence, that the hibernation period had not caused any further       degradation in instrument performances and that a viable payload       remained to support another cometary encounter.         Once experiment checkout had been completed, the Control Centre made       preparations for directing the spacecraft towards comet       Grigg-Skjellerup. This was no ordinary maneuver, as Earth's       gravitational field was to provide the kick needed to bring Giotto       into the otherwise unreachable orbit.  At 10:00 UT on 2 July, 1990,       exactly 5 years after its launch, and with the MAG and EPA activated,       Giotto flew over Earth at an altitude of 22 000 km and made space       history once again.         After this activity, Giotto was put into its second hibernation.         The second reactivation of the Giotto spacecraft had been scheduled       for 4 May 1992. At 16:55 h local time, the first commands were sent       from the European Space Operations Centre (ESOC) in Darmstadt, Germany,       via NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena (Calif.), to the 70 m       Deep-Space Network (DSN) ground station in Madrid, Spain, for uplinking       to Giotto. At that time, the space probe was 219 million kilometres       from Earth.         The commands sent were the first in an extensive series designed to       awaken Giotto from its hibernation configuration. To ensure reception       of the signals by the tiny omnidirectional antenna on the top of the       spacecraft, the DSN's most powerful 95 kW transmitter had to be used.         The spacecraft was configured to allow the transmitter connected to       the Low-Gain Antenna to be turned on. At 18:14 h local time, the Madrid       ground station reported the reception of a downlink carrier with a       signal strength of -171 dBm, as predicted by the ESOC Operations Team.       Giotto was back, again at the first attempt, just as in 1990 after its       first period of hibernation! Once again, Giotto had lived up to the       confidence that the Project and Operations Teams had placed in it.       Only the waiting required was a little nerve-racking, because the       remoteness of the spacecraft from Earth meant that one had to wait       nearly half an hour for the spacecraft's response to a command to be       seen on the ground!         A series of 'blind' maneuvers were subsequently performed to orient       Giotto so that its High-Gain Antenna (HGA) pointed towards Earth and       telemetry could be received.  This was accomplished on 7 May 1992,       when good telemetry was received continuously. At this point, the       Giotto reactivation effort could be truly declared a success!           Mission phase start time:  1990-02-19       Mission phase stop time:   1992-07-09           Flyby       -----         There were a number of features of the comet Grigg-Skjellerup encounter       that were most unlike those at encounter with Halley:         (1) Grigg-Skjellerup would approach Giotto at an angle of 68 degrees           instead of head-on as at Halley: hence the bumper shield would           afford no protection.         (2) The relative velocity was 14 km/s, with the comet meeting Giotto           from below and behind, whereas Halley had met Giotto head-on at           68 km/s.         (3) The Earth range at encounter was 214 x 10**6 km leading to a round-           trip light time of 24 min.  At Halley, the range had been 140 x           10**0 km and the round-trip light time was 16 min.           The good navigation of Giotto was confirmed by the data obtained by the       OPE, based on an analysis of the brightness increase of the sunlight       scattered by the dust particles in the inner coma.  The closest       approach was inferred to have occurred at a distance smaller than       200 km, with the brightness peak recorded at 15:30:43 with an       uncertainty of only 3 seconds.  At 03:00 on 11 July, 1992 all       experiments were switched-off.         Already at 03:00 UTC, more than 12 hours before the closest approach,       the JPA detected the presence of cometary ions.  During the last hour       before closest approach, after JPA confirmed the increase in the       density of the ions, RPA, the EPA, and the IMS also reported detection       of ions.  Meanwhile, periodic bit errors in telemetry were noticed at       ESOC, causing occasional loss of data.         At 15:20 the Optical Probe Experiment (OPE) could see cometary dust. At       15:31:02, when the first housekeeping telemetry format was received       after the major impact, the data showed the HGA to be oscillating       slightly around its nominal value.  An increase in the spin rate by       0.003 RPM was also observed while the solar aspect angle readings were       fluctuating between 89.26 degrees and 89.45 degrees, indicating a       nutation of about 0.1 degrees.  The small nutation of the spacecraft,       experienced around closest approach, can be explained by the spacecraft       being hit by one large dust particle of at least 30 mg effective mass,       assuming that this particle struck on the upper end of the solar cell       array.         At 03:00 on 11 July, 1992 all experiments were switched-off.  After a       period of seven years in orbit around the Sun, Giotto operations were       officially terminated on 23 July 1992, after the completion of final       orbit adjustments and after configuring the spacecraft for its third       hibernation.         In its present trajectory course, Giotto will pass 219 000 km above the       Earth's surface on 1 July 1999, 14 years after the spacecraft's launch.

The       satellite was developed to provide a general facility for observing       ultraviolet (UV) spectra of astronomical sources over the wavelength       range from about 1150 A to 3200 A.  The project has been a joint       undertaking in which the US National Aeronautics and Space       Administration (NASA) provided the spacecraft, the optical and       mechanical components of the scientific instrument, the US ground       observatory and spacecraft control software; the UK Science Research       Council (SRC) in collaboration with University College London (UCL)       provided the television cameras used to record the spectroscopic       data; and the European Space Agency (ESA) provided the solar arrays       and European ground observatory. The image processing software was       developed jointly by NASA and the SRC's Appleton Laboratory. The       satellite has been placed in geosynchronous orbit over the Atlantic       Ocean and is operated for 16h each day, for NASA sponsored       observers, from the US ground observatory located at the Goddard       Space Flight Center (GSFC) near Washington, D.C., and for the       remaining 8h by ESA, for ESA and UK sponsored observers, from the       European ground observatory located near Madrid.         A synchronous orbit has other advantages. Because the Earth subtends       an angle of only 17 degrees the unconstrained area of sky is much       greater than for low orbits and, as its movement along the ecliptic       is at the diurnal rate, the occurrence of occultations is       infrequent. Consequently, over large portions of the sky, neither       long exposures nor the observation of variable phenomena need be       periodically interrupted. A penalty is that in synchronous orbit       observations are normally made in full sunlight so the telescope       must be baffled to ensure adequate rejection of stray sunlight and       earthlight.  The offset guiding system can be influenced, however,       and relatively bright guide stars are needed near the Earth's limb.         The IUE mission was terminated on Sept 30, 1996 at 18:42 UT after a       life span of 18 years, 8 months, 4 days, 1 hour and 6 min.           ",INTERNATIONAL_UV_EXPLORER,

urn:esa:psa:context:investigation:mission.ulysses,ULYSSES,ULYSSES,"     Mission Overview   ================       Introduction     ------------       Launched in October 1990, Ulysses was an exploratory mission       carried out jointly by ESA and NASA and had as its primary       objective the study of the inner heliosphere in three       dimensions.  The importance of such a mission was recognized       even at the dawn of the space era (e.g., [SIMPSONETAL1959]),       since it was generally accepted that the conditions found in       the narrow band of heliographic latitudes available to       observers in the ecliptic plane were not representative of       the global structure of the inner heliosphere.  Nevertheless,       prior to Ulysses, attempts to understand the basic physical       processes occurring within this environment had, by       necessity, been based for the most part on observations made       in or near the ecliptic plane.  The Ulysses mission provided,       for the first time, comprehensive in-situ measurements of the       heliospheric particles and fields at distances from 1 to 5 AU       from the Sun, and at essentially all solar latitudes.         Within the framework of the Ulysses project, ESA was       responsible for the operation of the European-built       spacecraft, while NASA provided the launch, the spacecraft's       radioisotope thermoelectric power source, and was responsible       for acquisition of data using the Deep Space Network of       tracking stations.  The scientific payload comprising nine       hardware investigations was provided by international teams       of scientists from Europe and the United States.         The mission provided results addressing many aspects of solar       and heliospheric science.  In addition to numerous individual       publications, as of 1996 seven collections of papers had       appeared as special issues or sections of journals, each one       focusing on a specific part of the mission ([GRLV19N121992],       [SCIENCEV257N50761992], [JGRV98NA121993], [PSSV41N11/121993],       [SSRV72N1/21995], [SCIENCEV268N52131995], [GRLV22N231995]).         General aspects of the mission     ------------------------------       Following launch by the Space Shuttle, a combined IUS/PAM-S       upper-stage was used to inject Ulysses into a direct       Earth/Jupiter transfer orbit.  A gravity-assist maneuver at       Jupiter in February 1992 placed the spacecraft in its final       Sun-centered out-of-ecliptic orbit, with a perihelion       distance of 1.3 AU and an aphelion of 5.4 AU.  The orbital       period was 6.2 years.  Ulysses' trajectory took the spacecraft       literally into the uncharted third dimension of the heliosphere.         The prime mission, covering the period from launch up to the end       of September 1995, included two polar passes, which are defined to       be the parts of the trajectory when the spacecraft was above 70       degrees heliographic latitude in either hemisphere.  The first       polar pass (over the south solar pole) commenced on 26 June 1994       and ended on 5 November, the second pass (north) occurred one year       later (19 June - 29 September), making a total of 234 days       (or approximately 9 solar rotations) above 70 degrees latitude.       The maximum heliographic latitude reached by Ulysses was the same       in both hemispheres, namely 80.2 degrees.  Based on the scientific       success of the mission in the first solar orbit, and the excellent       health of the spacecraft and its payload, both ESA and NASA       undertook to continue operating the spacecraft for a second orbit       of the Sun.  Constituting what was essentially a new mission, the       so-called Second Solar Orbit brought Ulysses back over the solar       poles in 2000 and 2001.  In contrast to the high-latitude phase of       the prime mission, which took place under quiet solar conditions,       the second set of polar passes occurred close to solar maximum.         Scientific investigations     -------------------------       Phenomena studied by Ulysses include the solar wind, the       heliospheric magnetic field, solar radio bursts and plasma waves,       solar and interplanetary energetic particles, galactic cosmic       rays, interstellar neutral gas, cosmic dust, solar X-rays and       gamma-ray bursts.  The prime goal of all of these studies was       to characterize the heliographic latitude dependence of the       physical parameters involved.  In addition, however, Ulysses'       unique interplanetary orbit was highly suitable for carrying       out measurements that are difficult to perform from the       relative proximity of the Earth's orbit to the Sun.  An       important example of such measurements was the detection of       interstellar pick-up ions (atoms of interstellar gas that       have become singly ionized).  Other investigations carried       out by Ulysses included detailed interplanetary-physics       studies during the in-ecliptic Earth-Jupiter phase,       measurements in the Jovian magnetosphere during the Jupiter       encounter, and radio-science investigations of the Sun's       corona and the Io Plasma Torus using the spacecraft and       ground telecommunication systems.         Scientific highlights     ---------------------       Summaries of the key findings from the southern polar pass and       pole-to-pole transit have been reported elsewhere (e.g.       [SMITH&MARSDEN1995], [MARSDEN&SMITH1996A], [MARSDEN&SMITH1996B]).       The papers in [A&AV316N21996], in addition to addressing new       aspects of the data obtained during these periods, also focus on       the results from the first northern polar pass.  Of particular       interest in this context are the north-south asymmetries reported       by various authors.         Nutation Anomaly     ----------------       About two hours following deployment of the 7.5 meter axial       boom on 4 November 1990, a small nutation of the spacecraft       was observed.  This gradually grew until it reached a       half-cone angle of 3 degrees with a pronounced periodicity.       At that distance from Earth, data transmission was still in       S-band with its wide-angle beam.  If significant nutation had       occurred at larger geocentric distance, with the narrowbeam       (2 degree beamwidth) X-band system operating, data       transmission would have been seriously hampered.         Investigations to find the cause of the nutation and to find       ways to reduce and control it showed that the principal, but       not the only, cause was solar energy entering the axial boom       as the spacecraft rotated at 5 rpm.  This induced a periodic       bending of the boom which coupled into the entire spacecraft       to cause nutation.  As the spacecraft traveled further from       the Sun and the solar aspect angle diminished (putting the       boom into the shadow of the spacecraft), the effect was       reduced and on 17 December 1990 the nutation disappeared       completely.  In the period when nutation was still active, it       was experimentally established that use of the automatic       earth seeking attitude control system (closed loop CONSCAN)       was extremely efficacious in keeping nutation at very low       levels (see [WENZELETAL1992]).         Correct interpretation enabled the preparation for the return       of nutation in 1994 to be carried out in an orderly manner       followed by the successful control of nutation during a       period of over one year.  These activities stretched to the       limit the NASA and ESA ground facilities used for the task as       well as the operational staff located at JPL and at the       ground stations.  The fact that the acquired scientific data       were not degraded is proof of success of these operations.         In 1995, as expected, the joint ESOC-JPL Mission Operations       Team located at JPL had to contend with a renewed build-up of       the nutation disturbance.  Following the procedures developed       during previous periods when nutation was present, the onboard       Conscan system was operated in closed-loop mode in order to keep       the spacecraft's high gain antenna pointed at the Earth.  In line       with predictions, the nutation, which peaked in early May, had       decayed by early September.  The cooperation of NASA's Deep Space       Network in providing the round-the-clock tracking support needed       to operate Conscan throughout this period is gratefully       acknowledged.  Nutation is not expected to return until January       2001.       Mission Phases   ==============       Launch     ------       The spacecraft was launched on Oct. 6, 1990 by the shuttle       Discovery with two upper stages.  To reach high solar latitudes,       the spacecraft was aimed close to Jupiter so that Jupiter's large       gravitational field would accelerate Ulysses out of the ecliptic       plane to high latitudes; no man-made launch vehicle could by       itself provide the needed velocity for Ulysses to achieve high       latitudes.

Closest approach to the planet occurred at 12:02 UT on 8 February,       1992.         The inbound trajectory was rather similar to those of the four       spacecraft which flew past Jupiter previously: Pioneer 10, 11       (1972, 1973) and Voyager 1, 2 (1979). In contrast to these       missions, however, Ulysses reached high latitudes (40 degrees       north of Jupiter's equator) near closest approach. Ulysses'       outbound flight path was through the hitherto unexplored dusk       sector (18:00 hours local time) of the magnetosphere, this time at       high southern latitudes. Another unique aspect of the flyby was       the penetration of the Io Plasma Torus (IPT), a few hours after       closest approach, in a basically north-south direction which       contrasted with the nearly equatorial traversals of the Voyager 1       and Galileo spacecraft. In addition to this direct penetration,       the spacecraft radio signal passed through the IPT for a       significant length of time making it possible to probe the       electron density distribution in the Torus.

Important design requirements for the mission were to       maximize the time spent at high solar latitudes and to achieve the       highest possible latitude. Owing to the relative positions of the       Earth, Sun and Jupiter at the time of the planetary swing-by, a       south-going out-of-ecliptic trajectory best met these       requirements.

The       Ulysses polar passes are defined to be the segments of the       trajectory corresponding to solar latitudes greater than or       equal to 70 degrees in either hemisphere.  The south polar       pass lasted 132 days, equivalent to 5 solar rotations.       During this time, the distance from the spacecraft to the Sun       decreased from 2.8 AU to 1.9 AU (1 AU = 150 million km).  The       spacecraft reached its most southerly point, 80.2 degrees       south of the solar equator, on 13 September 1994, at a       distance of 2.3 AU from the Sun.         Polar Pass (latitude > 70 deg. S)    : 1994-06-26 to 1994-11-05       Max. Latitude (80.2 deg. S)          : 1994-09-13           First North Polar Pass:       On 30 September, five years after launch, Ulysses completed       the first phase of its exploratory mission to study the Sun's       environment from the perspective of a solar polar orbit.       Between 19 June and 29 September, one year after its south       polar pass, the spacecraft flew over the Sun's northern polar       regions, reaching a maximum latitude of 80.2 degrees north of       the equator on 31 July.         Polar Pass (latitude > 70 deg. N)    : 1995-06-19 to 1995-09-29       Max. Latitude (80.2 deg. N)          : 1995-07-31         Second Solar Orbit     ------------------       Ulysses' out-of-ecliptic orbit has a period of 6.2 years,       corresponding to approximately half a solar cycle. A consequence       of this is that the high-latitude passes of the second solar orbit       occurred close to the maximum of solar cycle 23. The conditions in       the polar regions are expected to be dramatically different from       those encountered during the prime mission. In particular, the       rather simple configuration of the corona found at solar minimum,       with large coronal holes over the polar caps, will have been       replaced by a much more complex arrangement, probably including       high-latitude streamers. Transient events (solar flares, coronal       mass ejections, etc.) related to the increase in solar activity       will dominate, greatly disturbing the underlying structure of the       solar wind and influencing the transport of cosmic rays and       energetic solar particles.

urn:esa:psa:context:investigation:mission.venus_express,VENUS EXPRESS,VENUS EXPRESS,"   Mission Overview ================ Venus Express is ESA's first mission to Venus. It reuses the design of the Mars Express spacecraft. Many of the instruments are simply upgraded versions of those developed for ESA's Mars Express and Rosetta missions. The scientific objectives of the mission is to study the atmosphere, the plasma environment, and the surface of Venus in great detail.   Venus Express was launched by a Soyuz-Fregat launcher from the Baikonour Cosmodrome on 9 November 2005. After separation, Venus Express, of mass 1244 kg,was placed into an interplanetary transfer orbit during approximately 150 days. After a 153 day cruise to Venus the spacecraft entered Venusian orbit on 11 april 2006. The first capture orbit was an eccentric polar and lasted 9 days. Several manoeuvres over the period 15 April-6 May 2006 lowered the spacecraft into its operational orbit: a 24-hour elliptical, quasi-polar orbit. The pericentre altitude is 250 kms and the apocentre altitude is 66000 kms.   Pericentre altitude                    250 km Apocentre altitude                     66000 km Period                                 24 h Inclination                            ~90 deg Pericentre latitude                    80 deg   The mission has been described in many papers [ESA2005; HUNTER2004]. Details about the mission launch sequence and timeline can be obtained from the Mission Calendar [DAUVIN2005] and from the Consolidated Report on Mission Analysis (CREMA) [SANCHEZ&RODRIGU2005].   Mission Phases ============== The mission timeline defines the different spacecraft and payload operations required per phase to prepare the spacecraft for Venus operational orbit acquisition, science data acquisition and transmission. The pre-routine mission phase, which are:     - the pre-launch phase     - the launch and early orbit phase     - the near earth commissioning phase     - the interplanetary cruise phase     - the venus orbit insertion phase     - the venus orbit commissioning phase, the nominal mission phase and the extended mission phases phase are detailed below.   PRELAUNCH --------- Pre-launch operations started approximately 6 months before the launch and covered the period from delivery of the spacecraft to the launch site until L-8 hrs in the launch countdown sequence. During this period the Venus Express Mission Operations Centre (VMOC) at ESOC performed its final simulation programme including the validation of the Flight Operations Plan (FOP) and the final mission control system.      mission phase start time : ~ June 2005      mission phase stop time  : 2005-11-09   LAUNCH AND EARLY ORBIT PHASE (LEOP) -----------------------------------   The Venus Express spacecraft was launched on a Soyouz-Fregat rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome at 3:33:34 UT on 9 November 2005.   The three-stage Soyuz launcher lifted the Fregat autonomous upper stage (fourth stage) with Venus Express mounted on it into a sub-orbital trajectory.   After separation from the Soyuz third stage, a Fregat main engine burn (at an altitude of about 200 kilometres) for around 20 seconds placed the Fregat-Venus Express composite into an almost circular parking orbit. After a coast phase of about 70 minutes in the low Earth orbit, a second Fregat engine burn, lasting 16 minutes, moved the combined craft from the parking orbit onto an escape trajectory, after which the Fregat stage and Venus Express separated.        Duration                 : 3 days      mission phase start time : 2005-11-09      mission phase stop time  : 2005-11-11   After separation, Venus Express spent approximately 150 days in an interplanetary transfer orbit. During this phase, trajectory corrections were performed using the spacecraft's own thrusters.   NEAR EARTH COMMISSIONING PHASE (NECP) -------------------------------------   It included the following activities for the spacecraft:      - spacecraft commissioning.      - deployment of the MAG Boom.      - Payloads commissioning.        Duration                 : 3 weeks      mission phase start time : 2005-11-12      mission phase stop time  : 2005-12-16   INTERPLANETARY CRUISE PHASE ---------------------------   The Interplanetary Cruise Phase finished about one month before Venus capture. During this 3 months phase, the spacecraft was on the Sun-centred ballistic orbit to Venus. Most of this phase was not dedicated to any specific activity, except the cruise orbit determination and correction.        Duration                 : 107 days      mission phase start time : 2005-12-17      mission phase stop time  : 2006-04-04   VENUS ORBIT INSERTION PHASE (VOI) ---------------------------   The Venus Orbit Insertion (VOI) phase was the period of transition between the Interplanetary Cruise phase and the final operational orbit around Venus. It started before the Venus capture manoeuvre and ended when the satellite reached the operational orbit. The duration of this phase was about 2 weeks.   A final course adjustment was performed on 29 March to fine tune the arrival hyperbola for Venus Orbit Insertion. The VOI manoeuvre took place on 11 April 2006. To enable capture of the spacecraft, it was first slewed such that the main engine was aligned to the direction of travel.   The main engine burn lasted around 50 minutes and decelerated the spacecraft by approximately 1251 ms-1 (~ 4500 kmh-1).   The spacecraft initially entered a highly elliptical polar orbit with a pericentre of 400 km, an apocentre of 350 000 km and a period of 9 days.   To achieve the final operational orbit a series of correction manoeuvres were necessary: Date             Activity                       Velocity Change (m/s) 15 April 2006    Pericentre Control Manoeuvre #1             5.8 20 April 2006    Apocentre Lowering Manoeuvre #1           199.9 23 April 2006    Apocentre Lowering Manoeuvre #2           105.3 26 April 2006    Apocentre Lowering Manoeuvre #3             9.2 29 April 2006    Apocentre Lowering Manoeuvre #4             8.0  2 May   2006    Apocentre Trim                              2.0  6 May   2006    Pericentre Control Manoeuvre #2             3.1        Duration                 : 16 days      mission phase start time : 2006-04-05      venus capture manoeuvre  : 2006-04-11      mission phase stop time  : 2006-04-21   VENUS ORBIT COMMISSIONING PHASE ---------------------------------   The Venus Payload Commissioning phase started when the spacecraft reached the operational orbit and ended when it was declared ready for science data acquisition and transmission to the Earth.   It was dedicated to spacecraft commissioning activities, payloads commissioning and demonstration activities prior to operational science operations. The duration of the Payload Commissioning phase around Venus was about 1 month. The operations to be performed during the phase were the following:      - S/C in-orbit commissioning,      - Payloads in-orbit commissioning,      - Isolation of the Propulsion system.        Duration                 : 42 days      mission phase start time : 2006-04-22      mission phase stop time  : 2006-06-03   ROUTINE OPERATIONS PHASE ------------------------   The selected operational orbit was inertially fixed, so that coverage of all planetocentric longitudes was accomplished in one Venus sidereal day (243 Earth days). The nominal mission orbital lifetime was two Venus sidereal days (486 Earth days). It consisted in science data acquisition from the payloads, data storage in the SSMM and data transmission to the Earth.   There were two different phases of operations for Venus Express once it was in operational orbit: the Earth Pointing phase and the Observation phase.   The Earth pointing phase was dedicated to communication with Earth and battery charging. It was used whenever the spacecraft was not in the observation phase. In the Earth pointing phase, one of the two High Gain Antennas was oriented towards Earth. The antenna was selected according to the season, so that the spacecraft's cold face remained always protected from illumination by the Sun. The rotation angle around the Earth direction was optimised in order to avoid any entrance of Sun light on the side walls radiators. High rate communication was performed 8 hours per day in X-band, in order to transmit to Earth all science data stored in the Solid State Mass Memory. An average of 2 Gbits of science data was downlinked every day to the new ESA ground station of Cebreros, Spain.   The observation phase consisted of several different modes of observation, depending on the payload configuration and spacecraft orientation: Nadir pointing, Limb observation, Star occultation, Radio science.   During observation, the Sun could illuminate under transient conditions any spacecraft face, except for the cold face. The duration of observation was therefore limited by thermal constraints and by battery discharge. The maximum duration of an observation period depended on the Sun direction with respect to the orbit plane, which varied along the mission.   Observations and spacecraft activities were planned based on the following principles:   1. Complete and uniform the coverage of the science themes   2. Balance between distant and close-up view of Venus   3. Balance between observations of the Northern and Southern   hemisphere   4. Synergy between experiments in covering science objectives   5. Use of two cases in each orbit: one in apocentre, one in   pericentre   6. Even distribution of pericentric cases with priority given to the   solar and Earth radio occultation experiments in specific seasons   7. Apocentric cases (2,3) were grouped in campaigns of 10 orbits   that was required by the atmospheric dynamics mission objectives   8. Maximum compliance with the current flight rules.   Individual Objectives per Instrument ------------------------------------   ASPERA On during the entire mission and permanently collecting data. Survey observations in the beginning of the mission and more specific and detailed observations on selected part of the orbit later in the mission. Data was collected at different rates depending on the selected mode.   MAG On during the entire mission and permanently collecting data. Data was collected at different rates depending on the selected mode.   SPICAV The main goal of SPICAV was to sound the Venus atmosphere in solar and stellar occultation geometry with sufficient latitude and local time coverage. SPICAV did also nadir and corona observations (90 deg slew from nadir pointing and back to nadir).   VeRa 4 types of observations 1. Earth occultation with as good as possible latitude and local time coverage of Venus. 2. Bi-static sounding of surface targets. The radio signal was sent to selected targets on the Venus surface. Reflected and scattered signal was received by ground station. As the signal was weak, the experiment depended on the Earth Venus distance, geometry and surface target properties. 3. Solar Corona observations in vincinity of conjunctions. 4. Gravity anomaly. It consisted in the precise tracking of the s/c while it passes over global geological formations on Venus solid body. It has been carried out only twice during the nominal mission . The Gravity Anomaly observations have been abandoned since the end of the nominal mission as the added scientific value with respect to previous observations was very small.          Duration                 : 486 days      mission phase start time : 2006-06-04      mission phase stop time  : 2007-10-02   EXTENDED OPERATIONS PHASE -------------------------   The nominal mission ended on October 2, 2007 when started the first extended mission. The first extended mission phase was approved until May 2009, end of MTP 040, May 30th, orbit 1135. It was followed by the second mission extension from MTP 041 that started in May, 31 2009 (orbit 1136). The second extension was followed by the third extension that started with MTP 057, August 22nd 2010, orbit 1584. The third extension ended with MTP 085 in December 2012.

Pericentre lowering campaign:   The pericentre altitude was maintained between 250 km and 350 km   during the first 8 months of the extended mission. After May 31,   2008 the pericentre was lowered to the corridor 170-220 km. This   pericentre lowering aimed at observing plasma at this altitude   range.

Orbits               : 286 - 329 Phase duration       : 43 days MTP                  : 10-12   Phase 6 ------- Phase 6 started at the beginning of the eclipse season #4 in orbit 330. It ended with the same season in orbit 369. The phase provided good conditions for observations of the night side and atmospheric sounding in solar occultation geometry. Solar occultations were used to study composition and structure of the atmosphere above the cloud top. Campaigns of off-pericentre observations and apocentre VIRTIS mosaic were used to study composition and dynamics of deep atmosphere on the night side. Conditions was also favourable for observations of nightglows to study composition and dynamics of the thermosphere and search for lightning. Limb observations in forward scattering geometry (spacecraft in eclipse) provided good opportunity to study vertical structure of hazes above the main cloud. Thermal mapping of the surface and search for active volcanism was performed. One bi-static sounding experiment (BSR #4) was scheduled. The night side surface targets were Beta Regio, Theia Mons and Phoebe Regio.   SPICAV observed nadir and Solar occultations. VeRa did the bi-static sounding experiment #4. VIRTIS and VMC observed off-pericentre and in mosaic mode. They observed Themis and Phoebe Regio on the night side.   Dates                : March 16 - April 24, 2007.

Thus significant portion of orbits was devoted to solar occultation observations. This phase was favourable for investigation of dayside dynamics. Proximity to the Earth provided good conditions for solar corona studies and bi-static sounding. Gravity #2 target was Atalanta Planitia, which was poorly covered by the Magellan observations. The thermal mapping covers Beta Regio, Phoebe Regio.   SPICAV observed nadir and solar occultation. VeRa did the gravity #2 experiment and bi-static radar sounding #6 (Beta Regio and Theia Mons).

However, solar occultations was only possible from orbit 576 to 596 because of the temperature conditions due to the sun position. VIRTIS performed some airglow campaign in nadir and limb geometry. VMC observed the surface on the night side. The observation targets were Asteria Regio, Hinemoa, Gunda and Kawelu Planitia, Beta Regio (Rheja and Theja Mons) and Phoebe Regio. SPICAV observed stars at large distance, later in the phase. Two spot pointings were performed in orbit 561 and 571 (study of cloud scattering phase function). Gravity measurements were performed over Atalanta Planita in orbits 615, 617, 619, 621. Meteors occurred in orbit 555. Despite the solar occultation that began 27th October 2007, SOIR did not make any observation neither calibration until 25th November 2007, due to thermal reasons in Quadrature period.     Dates                : October 27, 2007- January 3, 2008. Orbits               : 554 - 622 Phase duration       : 68 days MTP                  : 20-22   Phase 12 -------- Phase 12 started with Earth occultation season # 5 and ended with the eclipse season # 7. Earth occultation season began in orbit 623 and ended in orbit 692. Pendulum observations were performed during all this phase. From orbit 659 to orbit 680, three periods overlapped: Earth occultations, Eclipse season, solar opposition. The solar opposition was favorable for apocentre mosaics by VIRTIS. The surface targets for this phase were Atahensik and Zimina Coronae, Atla Regio (Ozza Mons) and East from it and Atalanta Planitia.   VIRTIS near-IR did temperature sounding in the same region. Then cross-correlation on results were made possible. From orbit 612 to 631 there was the VIRTIS apocentre mosaic season. Solar occultations and pendulum observations were mainly performed at the end of the phase (from orbit 690). VeRa had the priority for pericentre observations of the Southern Hemisphere. However, VeRa measurements were not possible from orbit 645 to 658 for NNO maintenance.   Dates                : January 3 - March 31, 2008. Orbits               : 623 - 710 Phase duration       : 87 days MTP                  : 22-25   Phase 13 -------- There was no specific season during most of phase 13. During this phase, pericentre observations, stellar occultation observations, limb observations at pericentre were performed. At the end of the phase 13, in orbit 769, the mission entered superior conjunction phase and telecommunication outage period (orbit 769 to 790) during which all science operations were suspended.   Dates                : April 1 - June 4, 2008. Orbits               : 711 - 775 Phase duration       : 64 days MTP                  : 25-28   Phase 14 -------- Phase 14 started with the eclipse season #8 and Earth occultation season #6. At the beginning of the phase, the superior solar conjunction prevented any science observations. The eclipse and Earth occultation seasons overlapped (orbit 777-821). The Earth occultation period lasted longer up to orbit 832. The targets for the surface observations were East flank of Atla Regio, Ozza Mons, Zevana and Paga Chasma. During this phase, there was a pericentre lowering campaign in orbits 814, 815, 821, 822, 829 and 830.   VMC performed surface imaging and  wind tracking. SPICAV  did solar occultations (ingress and egress solar occultations in orbits 811-819), night and plane limbs and UV observations of the exosphere on the day side. Stellar occultations may have been performed in coordination with VeRa. They observed dayglow when flying perpendicular to terminator. Possibly sub-solar point tracking may have been performed by SOIR. VIRTIS performed night limbs together with SPICAV and surface imaging. The VeRa Earth occultation experiments began in orbit 817.     Dates                : June 5 - July 31, 2008. Orbits               : 776 - 832 Phase duration       : 56 days MTP                  : 28-30   Phase 15 -------- There was no specific season during phase 15. The pericentre lowering campaign that began in the previous phase ends at orbit 836 and occurred in orbits 836 and 837. SPICAV performed night limbs, plane limbs and stellar occultations. Later in the phase, SPICAV performed day side limbs. VMC performed wind tracking on the day side. VIRTIS did night side and terminator monitoring and limb observations together with SPICAV at the beginning of the phase. Later in the phase, day side and terminator monitoring was performed.   Dates                : August 1 - September 22, 2008. Orbits               : 833 - 885 Phase duration       : 52 days MTP                  : 30-32   Phase 16 -------- This phase started with Eclipse season (orbit 866 - 934). During phase 16, there was also a Mosaic season (orbit 903 - 969) and the Earth occultation season #7 (orbit 921 - 985). Pendulum observations were frequently used. There was a joint VIRTIS-SPICAV campaign of night side nadir airglow observations in equatorial zone. There was good opportunity for SOIR nadir observations. SPICAV  performed solar occultation and limb observations. VMC performed monitoring, wind tracking on the day side, surface imaging between solar occultations. Around orbit 967, they performed night side imaging of Aphrodite Terra. VIRTIS performed day side monitoring, limb observations together with SPICAV. Later in the phase, VIRTIS also performed Mosaic at apocentre. VeRa performed radio occultations. VIRTIS suffered a failure of the M cooler on 27th October 2008. As a consequence, from this date, there was no M-IR data.   Dates                : September 23 - December 31, 2008. Orbits               : 886 - 985 Phase duration       : 99 days MTP                  : 32-35   Phase 17 -------- This phase started with the end of the Earth occultation season.

The Venusian atmosphere was studied             during the Venus Express mission of the European Space Agency. Akatsuki was also             designed to study the Venusian atmosphere, but in contrast to the Venus Express strategy,             five cameras with narrowband filters will image Venus at different wavelengths to track             the distributions of clouds and minor gaseous constituents at different heights.             In other words, we aim to study the Venusian atmospheric dynamics in three dimensions,             while Venus Express collected mainly spectroscopic observations of the atmosphere.             The mission started with the mission name and the spacecraft name PLANET-C, which means             Japan's third planetary explorer succeeding SUISEI (PLANET-A), which observed Halley's             comet, and NOZOMI (PLANET-B), which could not complete its mission to explore Mars.

Those looks are also archived in delay-Doppler format with the PDS, and the documentation for that archive details the data collection steps (https://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/missions/venus_radar/index.htm). In all but the 2012 dataset, the echoes were transmitted from and received at the Arecibo Observatory. In 2012 the Green Bank Telescope was used as a receiver. For each observing year with Venus close to inferior conjunction, there are multi-look views of the ""northern"" and ""southern"" hemispheres, defined with respect to the sub-radar point latitude and longitude during the period. All maps are referenced to a 335 E projection longitude. Each map set contains an image in the opposite-sense circular polarization (OCP, sometimes called ""polarized"") and one in the same-sense circular polarization (SCP, sometimes called ""depolarized""). Spatial sampling is at 1 km per pixel, or about 106 pixels per degree on Venus. The individual looks are normalized to the background noise level such that the OCP and SCP mosaics can be ratioed to obtain the circular polarization ratio (CPR).

Spacewatch was created to explore the various populations of small objects in the solar             system and study the statistics of asteroids and comets in order to investigate the             dynamical evolution of the solar system. Studies included the Main-Belt, Centaur,             Trojan, Comet, Trans-Neptunian, and Earth-approaching asteroid populations.             Spacewatch played an important role in selecting potential targets for interplanetary             spacecraft missions.             After 1998, Spacewatch focused primarily on follow-up astrometry of such targets, and             monitored the positions and motions of objects that might present a hazard to the Earth.             Later on, the focus was on near-Earth objects (NEOs), especially Potentially Hazardous             Asteroids (PHAs) and Virtual Impactors (VIs).

The impact delivered more energy to Jupiter       than the largest nuclear warheads ever built, and up to a       significant percentage of the energy delivered by the impact which       is generally thought to have caused the extinction of the dinosaurs       on Earth, roughly 65 million years ago.         History       -------       The comet, the ninth short-period comet discovered by Gene and       Carolyn Shoemaker and David Levy, was first identified on a       photograph taken on the night of 24 March 1993 with the 0.4-meter       Schmidt telescope at Mt. Palomar.  On the original image it appeared       'squashed'.  Subsequent photographs at a larger scale taken by Jim       Scotti with the Spacewatch telescope on Kitt Peak showed that the       comet was split into many separate fragments.  Before the end of       March it was realized that the comet had made a very close approach       to Jupiter in mid-1992 and at the beginning of April, after       sufficient observations had been made to determine the orbit more       reliably, Brian Marsden found that the comet is in orbit around       Jupiter.  By late May it appeared that the comet was likely to       impact Jupiter in 1994.  Since then, the comet has been the subject       of intensive study.  Searches of archival photographs have       identified pre-discovery images of the comet from earlier in March       1993 but searches for even earlier images have been unsuccessful.         Cometary Orbit       --------------       According to the most recent computations, the comet passed less       than 1/3 of a Jovian radius above the clouds of Jupiter late on 7       July 1992 (UT).  The individual fragments separated from each other       1 1/2 hours after closest approach to Jupiter and they are all in       orbit around Jupiter with an orbital period of about two years.       Calculations of the orbit prior to 7 July 1992 are very uncertain       but it seems very likely that the comet was previously in orbit       around Jupiter for two decades or more.  Because the orbit takes the       comet nearly 1/3 of an astronomical unit (30 million miles) from       Jupiter, the sun causes significant changes in the orbit.  Thus,       when the comet again came close to Jupiter in 1994 it actually       impacted the planet, moving almost due northward at 60 km/sec aimed       at a point only halfway from the center of Jupiter to the visible       clouds.         The 23 identified fragments all hit Jupiter in the southern       hemisphere, at latitudes near 45 S, between 16 and 22 July 1994,       approaching the atmosphere at an angle roughly 45 deg from the       vertical.  The times of the impacts were known to within a few hours       but observations in early 1994 significantly improved the precision       of the predictions.  The impacts happened on the back side of       Jupiter as seen from Earth in an area that was also in darkness.       This area was close to the limb of Jupiter and was carried by       Jupiter's rotation to the front, illuminated side less than half an       hour after the impact.  The grains ahead of and behind the comet       impacted Jupiter over a period of four months, centered on the time       of the impacts of the major fragments.  The grains in the tail of       the comet passed behind Jupiter and remain in orbit around the       planet.         The Nature of the Comet       -----------------------       The exact number of large fragments is not certain since the best       images show hints that some of the larger fragments were multiple.       At least 23 major fragments were identified.  No observations are       capable of resolving the individual fragments to show the solid       nuclei.  Images with the Hubble Space Telescope suggested that there       were discrete, solid nuclei in each of the largest fragments which,       although not spatially resolved, produce a single, bright pixel that       stood out above the surrounding coma of grains.  Reasonable       assumptions about the spatial distribution of the grains and about       the reflectivity of the nuclei implied sizes of 2 to 4 km (diameter)       for each of the 11 brightest nuclei.  Because of the uncertainties       in these assumptions, the actual sizes were very uncertain.         No outgassing was detected from the comet.  The dust distribution       suggests that the material ahead of and behind the major fragments       in the orbit were likely large particles from the size of sand up to       boulders.  The particles in the tail are very small, not much larger       than the wavelength of light.  The brightnesses of the major       fragments were observed to change by factors up to 1.7 between March       and July 1993, although some became brighter while others became       fainter.         Summary of impact times, impact locations, and impact geometries       ----------------------------------------------------------------       Published estimates of the impact times and locations of the       fragments of SL9 are given below (Table 5 in Chodas, P.W. and       Yeomans, D.K.(1996) [CHODAS&YEOMANS1996]).  Impact was defined to       occur at the 100mbar level of Jupiter's atmosphere.  The impact for       all fragments except J and M are based on independent orbit       solutions given by Chodas and Yeomans (1996) [CHODAS&YEOMANS1996].       The estimates for the 'lost' fragments J and M were obtained by       applying the tidal disruption model to the orbit for fragment Ql and       matching the astrometry of these two fragments relative to Ql.  The       third column of the table contains the final pre-impact prediction       for each of the fragments as distributed electronically by the UMd       e-mail exploder.  The fourth column lists the final best estimates,       which were inferred directly from impact phenomena for 16 fragments,       and computed from the orbit solutions for the rest.  All times are       as viewed from the Earth, and therefore include the light travel       time.  The impact time uncertainties are rough estimates which       indicate a confidence level in the accepted time; they are not       formal 1-sigma uncertainties.  The impact latitude is jovicentric,       while the longitude is System III, measured westwards on the       planet.  The meridian angle is the jovicentric longitude of the       impact point measured from the midnight meridian towards the morning       terminator.  At the latitude of the impacts, the limb as viewed from       the Earth was at meridian angle 76 deg, and the terminator was at       meridian angle 87 deg.  The final column gives the angular distance       of the impacts behind the limb.     Event         Impact Time (UTC)         Impact Location Merid. Ang.

Six experiments were carried as part of the science payload: television, ultraviolet spectrometer, infrared spectroscopy, infrared radiometry, S-band occultation and celestial mechanics. Two experiments (S-band occultation and celestial mechanics) utilized the radio telemetry subsystem to derive data; the other required specially developed instruments, mounted, and boresighted to each other, on the spacecraft's scan platform. Pre-launch mission planning encompassed two separate, but complementary, missions. The orbit of each spacecraft was optimized to match the corresponding objective. The mapping mission was designed with an Earth-synchronous orbit (about a 12-hr periods) to maximize antenna utilization, or communications efficiency. For maximum surveillance of an area, it was designed with a steep inclination (80 degrees) to the equatorial plane of Mars. The dynamic objective dictated a Mars-synchronous (or sub-synchronous) orbit and a lower (50 degree) inclination for closer observations of specific areas. The plans for the two missions were in detailed stages of development on May 9, 1971 when Mariner 8 was lost because of guidance difficulties in the second stage of the launch vehicle.

On August 21, 1993, flight controllers lost contact with the Mars Observer spacecraft when an expected transmission that was part of the pre-Mars-Orbit-Insertion sequence failed to occur. Subsequent attempts to re-establish communication with the spacecraft proved unsuccessful. After the 11-month transit the spacecraft was to be injected into an elliptical orbit around Mars with periapsis near the north pole. The orbit would then be adjusted through a series of maneuvers to a near-circular, sun-synchronous (2 am/pm), low altitude, near-polar orbit. Due to the non-uniformity of the gravity field, the altitude was to vary from 376 km near the south pole to 430 km near the north pole. During the Martian year in this mapping orbit the instruments were to acquire data in a systematic program of global mapping. At the end of the mission the spacecraft could have been boosted to a permanent quarantine orbit. The Mars orbit insertion (MOI) period was to end one month before solar conjunction and the beginning of the dust storm period. The playback data rate for a 10-hour link would vary by a factor of 4 with Earth-Mars distance during the mission. The continuous data rate to the tape recorders was about one fifth the playback rate for a 10-hour link to a 34 m NASA Deep Space Network tracking station. The normal sequence of collecting scientific data would be to record continuously for 24 hours and then to play the data back in one 10-hour link. The mapping orbit would be a 117-minute orbit with a 7-day repeat cycle. As a result, the planet would be repeatedly mapped in 26-day cycles with a 58.6 km nominal path separation. Orbit trim adjustments would make it possible to obtain uniform coverage during the course of the mission with an ultimate spacing of ground tracks at the equator or 3.1 km.

urn:nasa:pds:context:investigation:mission.next,NEXT,NEXT,"   One-sentence Mission Result Summary ===================================     The small changes in comet 9P/Tempel 1 between two observed perihelia,   in 2005 by Deep Impact and in 2011 by Stardust-NExT, were most obvious   in the vicinity of smooth flows [VEVERKAETAL2011].     Mission overview ================     Stardust-NExT was an extended mission that used the Stardust (SDU)   spacecraft to effect a flyby of comet 9P/Tempel 1 at 178 km on   15 February, 2011 (40 days post perihelion) and obtain high-resolution   images of the coma and nucleus, as well as measurements of the   composition, size distribution and flux of dust emitted into the coma.   The SDU spacecraft had been launched in 1999 and had already flown by   comet 81P/Wild 2 in January, 2004 as part of the prime Stardust mission   ([BROWNLEEETAL2003] [SEMENOVETAL2004A], [RYNOETAL2004A]   [SEMENOVETAL2008]).     The 2005 impact by the Deep Impact (DI) mission on 9P/Tempel 1 excavated   ejecta with an optical depth such that the cameras on the DI flyby   spacecraft could not image the surface in the impact area.  Therefore the   size of and character of the crater that had been excavated could not be   determined ([AHEARNETAL2005A], [AHEARNETAL2005B]) by the DI mission.     Mission activities included a plan to update knowledge of the rotational   phase of the comet sufficiently well to view significant portions of the   hemisphere studied by Deep Impact in 2005 and imaging the crater   excavated by the impactor [BELTONETAL2011] [MEECHETAL2011].     Stardust-NExT was a low-cost, low-risk mission to complete and expand   the investigation of comet Tempel 1 initiated by Deep Impact, and for   the first time assess the changes in the surface of a comet between two   successive perihelion passages.  It provided important new data that   may be used to assess how Jupiter family comets (JFCs) evolve and how   they were formed 4.6 billion years ago.     The investigation of comets addresses each of the three strategic   objectives for solar system exploration enunciated in NASA's Space   Science Enterprise Strategy (SSES) 2003:       To learn how the solar system originated and evolved to its current     state.       To understand how life begins and determine the characteristics of     the solar system that led to the origin of life.       To catalog and understand the potential impact hazard to Earth from     space.     ([WEILERETAL2003])     Stardust-NExT contributed significantly to the first and last of these   objectives.  Stardust-NExT was designed to obtain essential new data,   capitalize on the discoveries of earlier missions to determine how   cometary nuclei were constructed at the birth of the solar system,   and increase our understanding of how they have evolved since then.     The investigations on the Stardust-NExT mission included:       Cometary coma and nucleus imaging (Navigation Camera a.k.a. NAVCAM,     [NEWBURNETAL2003])       Comet particle composition measurements (Cometary and Interstellar     Dust Analyzer a.k.a. CIDA [KISSELETAL2003])       Dust flux measurements (Dust Flux Monitor Instrument a.k.a. DFMI,     [TUZZOLINOETAL2003])     The Sample Return Capsule (SRC) had been returned to Earth in 2006 and   was no longer part of the in-flight spacecraft [FARNHAM&SEMENOV2006].     Mission phases ==============     Based on NAVCAM activities, and particle instruments' general inactivity   before and after the Tempel 1 encounter, there were four logical mission   phases for Stardust-NExT:  CRUISE; APPROACH; ENCOUNTER; DEPARTURE.     N.B. Because of differences in sensing range between the imaging and        particle instruments, these logical mission phases correspond only        approximately to instrument-specific operational data collection        periods or subphases as defined in instrument data catalogs for the        Stardust-NExT data sets.          For the particle instruments, CIDA and DFMI, there are only        two phases:  CRUISE and ENCOUNTER.  APPROACH and DEPARTURE, as        defined here, are combined and considered to be CRUISE.          For the NAVCAM, operational mission subphases were defined as CO        (CHECKOUT), C5 and C6 (CRUISE 5 and 6), and TE (TEMPEL ENCOUNTER),        and those two-letter acronyms were used in the NAVCAM PRODUCT_IDs        and FILE_NAMEs.  C6 was not intentional but was added when the        NAVCAM image count was reset during C5, temporarily causing problems        in the ground data system.  An earlier mission phase, C4 (CRUISE 4)        was defined but no NAVCAM data were taken during that phase.        Details of these two-letter NAVCAM 'subphase' designations have been        provided in the NAVCAM data set.       CRUISE   ------       Performed instrument checkout and calibration activities:  All     instruments were in CRUISE configuration when turned on:  NAVCAM and     DFMI were off except for calibrations; CIDA was on nearly continuously.     Minimal science data were taken except for CIDA.  NAVCAM activities     included characterization of photometric (stars), geometric (star     clusters), bias and dark (shutter closed), and post-decontamination     (post-bake) behaviors.  Navigation maneuvers were performed including     Tempel 1 time of arrival adjustment in February, 2010 to maximize the     probability of optimizing imaging of both previously seen and unseen     comet surface including the DI crater.

All instruments were in cruise configuration when     turned on.  CIDA was off.  DFMI was off except for calibration.     NAVCAM coma observations started with eight-image sets every 2-6 days,     increasing later to up to ~100 images per day, interrupted only for     calibration and decontamination.  Significant scattered light was     observed for most of these images, due to the spacecraft attitude and     mirror angle used, which prevented coma detection.  The coma was first     detected in summed images at E-28d when the sequences were modified to     use a spacecraft attitude which minimized scattered light.  Approach     phase ended with a two-day standdown of instrument operations to     prepare for ENCOUNTER phase (below).  Because of the standdown, there     is a discontinuity (gap) between the APPROACH stop date and the     ENCOUNTER start date.

NAVCAM took seventy-two high-spatial resolution     brightness-compressed images over T +/- ~4minutes; four of these were     coma observations for which the comet nucleus was intentionally     overexposed.  CIDA was on continuously.  DFMI was on for T +/- ~20     minutes.  Auto-navigation software performed flawlessly and kept the     bulk of the comet nucleus in all NAVCAM images.  Before and after the     encounter, the spacecraft was in two-day standdowns of instrument     operations to downlink data.  Because of the standdowns, there are     discontinuities (gaps) between the APPROACH stop date and the     ENCOUNTER start date, and between the ENCOUNTER stop date and the     DEPARTURE start date.

All instruments were in cruise configuration when turned on.     CIDA was off.  DFMI was off except for a final calibration.  NAVCAM     imaging was stopped at E+10d after the coma was determined to be too     faint for further scientific utility.  Remaining spacecraft fuel was     burned to exhaustion on 26 March in a final maneuver to allow     validation and/or calibration of fuel estimation techniques used on     this and other missions.  The Stardust spacecraft was left in a safe     orbit (it will not come near Earth for the foreseeable future) and will     boot to a safe configuration in the event the solar panels supply power     to the processing unit.

urn:nasa:pds:context:investigation:mission.saturn_ring_plane_crossing_1995,SATURN RING PLANE CROSSING 1995,SATURN RING PLANE CROSSING 1995,"     Mission Overview   ================     The Earth and Sun cross Saturn's ring plane every 13-15 years.     Because of the orbital characteristics of Saturn and Earth,     these ring plane crossing (RPX) events can be either triple     (with Earth crossing the ring plane three times) or single     (with Earth crossing the ring plane only once).  Single     crossings generally occur with Saturn very close to solar     conjunction, and so are difficult to observe from the Earth.     Triple crossings are generally much more favorable to     Earth-based observers.       The period around a Saturn RPX enables Earth-based astronomers to     study a wide range of phenomena not observable at any other     time.  Direct measurements of ring thickness and vertical ring     warps become possible.  Precise timing of the crossings make it     possible to better determine Saturn's rotation pole.  With the     rings becoming very thin and faint, detections of faint outer     rings and tiny ring-moons become possible.  Also, satellite     eclipses, occultations and mutual events during the RPX period     can be used to refine satellite orbits throughout the Saturn     system.       A triple RPX occurred in 1995-1996.  Earth passed through the     plane of Saturn's rings on May 22, 1995, August 10, 1995 and     February 11, 1996.  Of these events, only the third was     difficult to observe due to Saturn's proximity to the Sun.  The     Sun also crossed the ring plane as well, November 17-21, 1995.     Astronomers carried out a wide range of Saturn observations     during this period.       The next two Saturn RPXs crossings will be unfavorable from     Earth: they are both single events occurring on 4 September     2009 and 23 March 2025.  Earth-based observers will not get a     favorable edge-on view of Saturn's rings until the triple RPX     events of 2038-2039.       Although no formal NASA 'mission' was organized for the 1995     RPX, data acquired for Saturn and its rings and moons were some     of the best obtained since the Voyager encounters and serve as     a useful bridge to the upcoming Cassini mission in 2004-2008.     To foster the combined analysis of data from different sources     and thereby to maximize the scientific return from this     'mission', the PDS Rings Node is archiving data from the     1995-1996 RPX in a series of CDROMs.       Mission Phases   ==============     Four major events occurred during the Saturn ring plane     crossing period---three Earth crossings and one Sun crossing.     The mission phases listed below have been chosen somewhat     arbitrarily to be centered on these four events, plus the two     extended periods before and after the crossings.         PRE-RPX     -------       The pre-RPX phase extended up to the time approximately three       weeks before Earth's first ring plane crossing.

A long term     observing campaign was undertaken in order to extend the time line     of astrometric observations.       The campaign used archival HST data from 1994, previously     unexamined RPX images, and a large series of targeted WFPC2     observations between 1996 and 2005. The ultimate goals were to     refine the ephemerides of both satellites and if possible     determine the cause or causes of the discrepancies.       Sufficient observations to produce astrometrically meaningful data     for nine other satellites were obtained incidentally in the     Prometheus-Pandora observing campaign.       Details of the project can be found in FRENCHETAL2006.         ",,
urn:nasa:pds:context:investigation:mission.solar_and_heliospheric_observatory,SOLAR AND HELIOSPHERIC OBSERVATORY,SOLAR AND HELIOSPHERIC OBSERVATORY,"       Mission Overview   ================     The Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) is an unmanned scientific   space mission developed by ESA and NASA. The spacecraft was launched on Dec   2, 1995 aboard an Atlas IIAS rocket from Cape Canaveral, FL. Eventually, the   SOHO spacecraft was placed in an orbit about the first Lagrangian, or L1,   libration point, that point along the Earth-Sun line at which the   gravitational attraction of the spacecraft to the Earth is just balanced by   its attraction to the Sun. Located approximately 1.5 million kilometers from   Earth, SOHO required a 'cruise phase' of about 4 months to settle into its   orbit about L1. The orbit allows for observations of very low frequency   helioseismologic oscillations, and for continuous observation of the Sun's   outer atmosphere, but suffers some disadvantage in that the distance takes a   toll on allowable telemetry data rates. The orbit is only quasi-stable, and   periodic station keeping is required. The nominal lifetime for the SOHO   mission was two years after arrival on station. Expendables were carried,   however, sufficient for at least 6 more years of operation. The mission was   extended in 1997 and again in 2002, and is ongoing as of 2010.     On June 24, 1998, SOHO had a series of events that caused it to lose Sun   pointing on June 25. The spacecraft started spinning around the solar vector   sufficiently fast that it flipped to place the angular momentum vector with   the highest moment of inertia pointing towards the Sun. This meant that the   solar arrays and instruments were pointed almost 90 degrees away from the   Sun so that no power was being generated. This lack of power combined with   the pointing change meant that no communication with the spacecraft was   possible.     Due to its orbit around the Sun, it took several weeks for the spacecraft's   solar arrays to be pointed at the Sun. Contact with the spacecraft was made   on July 23, 1998 by bouncing a signal off the spacecraft by the Arecibo and   NASA/Deep Space Network RADAR. This confirmed the orbital position and the   spacecraft spin rate. This information confirmed the results of detailed   analyses that the spacecraft was spinning at about 1 RPM and in such a way   that the solar arrays would be pointed at the Sun for a maximum of 30   seconds each spin period.     On August 3, a very short carrier signal from the spacecraft was received by   the DSN, and 5 days later a short burst of telemetry was received. LASCO   temperatures recorded in the telemetry were indicating that the instrument   was colder than -50C which was the lowest limit that could be read out by an   onboard thermistor. An analysis by the thermal engineers showed that the   LASCO was actually between -80 to -120C. The CCD cameras were at the colder   end of this range. On September 16, 1998, SOHO reacquired the Sun.     In mid-2003, a malfunction in the pointing mechanism of the satellite's   high-gain antenna (HGA) was detected. The antenna, which is used to transmit   the large amounts of data from SOHO's scientific observations to Earth must   be able to move along two axes, vertical and horizontal. The horizontal   (East-West) movement was no longer taking place properly. As a result, the   spacecraft must be rolled by 180 degrees every 3 months to cover both halves   of the orbit. Between each half, there is a gap of 9 to 16 days where the   HGA cannot be used, however medium-rate telemetry continues through its   omnidirectional Low-Gain Antenna (LGA). Thus, minimal data loss occurs   during these blackouts, and the SOHO spacecraft continues to operate as   safely as before the antenna anomaly occurred.

During cruise to Mars, the landers were attached to the orbiters; the combined spacecraft were then known as Viking 1 and 2. The role of the orbiters was to transport the landers to Mars, to carry reconnaissance instruments for certifying the landing sites, to act as relay stations for lander data, and to perform their own scientific investigations. The initial orbit periapses were placed over the candidate landing sites to allow for maximum viewing resolution and relay of the lander data. After the primary lander missions were completed, the orbiters' orbits were allowed to drift so that the entire planetary surface could be systematically mapped by the three remote sensing experiments. The Viking 1 spacecraft was launched August 20, 1975, and arrived at Mars on June 19, 1976. Lander 1 was deployed to the Mars surface on July 20, 1976. The VO1 orbital inclination of 38-39 degrees was chosen to optimize communication with VL1. Viking 2 was launched September 9, 1975 and arrived at Mars August 7, 1976. VL2 landed on September 3, 1976, at a more northerly site than VL1. The VO2 orbit was correspondingly more inclined than VO1; initially 55 degrees, it was later adjusted to 80 degrees, providing particularly good coverage of polar regions.
