urn:nasa:pds:context:telescope:arecibo.305m,305-m fixed spherical reflecting antenna,," 	    Arecibo's 305-m fixed spherical reflecting radio antenna was the primary telescope 	    at Arecibo Observatory between 1963 and 2020, when it was irreparably damaged by a 	    series of failures in its supporting cables.  Because the surface was spherical, 	    the antenna used 'line' feeds, each connected to receivers in 'carriage houses' 	    supported above the reflector by towers and cables. In the late 1990s one of the 	    carriage houses was replaced with reflecting optics that corrected the spherical 	    aberration over a wide bandwidth, reduced receiver noise by a factor of several, 	    and made gain less dependent on pointing.  The antenna was 'pointed' over angles of 	    approximately 0-20 degrees from zenith by by moving the carriage houses. Initially 	    the antenna was used for radio astronomy above 50 MHz and solar system radar 	    astronomy (including active probing of Earth's upper atmosphere) at 430 MHz. In the 	    mid-1970s, the reflecting surface was improved and new receivers and transmitters 	    were added, allowing radio observations to 11 GHz and radar operation at 2380 MHz.          The position of the telescope was determined through surveying and comparison to         stations determined using the Global Positioning System. The accuracy of the position         is approximately 1m.

ALMA is composed of 66 high precision antennae, operating at wavelengths of 0.32 to 3.6 mm. Its main 12-meter array has fifty antennae, each measuring 12 meters in diameter, acting together as a single telescope — an interferometer. An additional compact array of four 12-meter and twelve 7-meter antennas complements this. The ALMA antennae can be arranged in different configurations, where the maximum distance between antennae can vary from 150 meters to 16 kilometers. The ALMA correlator, a specialized computer that combines the information received by the antennae, can perform a remarkable 16000 million-million (1.6x1016) operations per second.  ALMA was inaugurated in 2013, but early scientific observations using a partial array already began in 2011.  ALMA is a partnership between ESO (representing its Member States), NSF (USA) and NINS (Japan), together with NRC (Canada), NSC and ASIAA (Taiwan), and KASI (South Korea), in cooperation with the Republic of Chile. The Joint ALMA Observatory is operated by ESO, AUI/NRAO and NAOJ.  Each radio receiver type is sensitive to a particular wavelength range (band), and data can only be taken in one band at a time.  To date, eight out of a planned ten receivers have been installed on each ALMA antenna. These bands range from band 3, starting at wavelengths of 3.6 mm, to band 10, ending at 0.3 mm. Band 1 is under construction (covering wavelengths between 6 and 8.5 millimeters), and band 2 (covering 3.3 to 4.5 millimeters) might be added in the future.  Band 3: Produced by the Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics in Canada. It covers the longest wavelength range of the bands initially installed, between 2.6-3.6 mm (84-116 GHz). Band 4: Developed by National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ). It covers a wavelength range of 1.8-2.4 mm (125-163 GHz). Band 5: Developed by the Group for Advanced Receiver Development (GARD) at Onsala Space Observatory, Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden. The production of the 66 receivers for the ALMA observatory was done jointly by GARD and NOVA. It covers a  wavelength range of 1.4-1.8 mm (163-211 GHz). Band 6: Produced by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO). It covers the wavelength range of 1.1-1.4 mm (211-275 GHz). Band 7: Delivered by the Institut de Radio Astronomie Millimétrique (IRAM). It covers the wavelength range of 0.8-1.1 mm (275-373 GHz). Band 8: Developed by NAOJ.

From the base to the top of its huge feed arm, the GBT stands 485 feet              tall. Its 100-meter by 110-meter dish required 7,652 beams to support it              on top of a nearly hemispherical tilting gear. A gigantic yoke cradles              that gear above a base of concrete sunk 25 feet down to solid Appalachian              bedrock.                          Over 17 million pounds of telescope glide around its 360-degree concrete              track, thanks to four four-wheeled trucks, making the GBT the largest              moving object on land. Its remarkable agility allows it to see 85% of the              skies surrounding the Earth over the course of a year.                          Its 200-foot feed arm is a two-towered trusswork sticking out of the side              of the dish and ending in a secondary mirror perched 60 feet above the              dish. The secondary aims the dish's focused radio waves into one of eight              receivers hanging in a rotating turret. On the fly, a new receiver can be              spun into the beam to change the frequency being recorded. A ninth              receiver can swing out on a boom arm in place of the secondary, giving              astronomers a huge range of science they can pursue with one telescope.                          Scientists from around the world use the GBT to observe the skies for              6500 hours every year.

Each mirror blank was then shipped to REOSC Optique in Paris, France, for polishing              of its reflecting surface to that of a concave hyperboloid. The measured surface accuracy is 15.6 nm (rms).                          Each secondary mirror is 1.0 m in diameter. Each was prefabricated by Schott from Zerodur and then polished by              Zeiss to a convex hyperbolic shape and lightweighted by 85%. The weight of each secondary is 54 kg. The rms surface              accuracies are 17 nm for the Gemini N mirror and 13 nm for the Gemini S mirror. Each secondary mirror is mounted on              a rapid tip-tilt and chopping mechanism designed and built by Lockheed. Tip-tilt correction is possible up to 200 Hz.              The chopping capabilities are: any position angle on the sky at frequencies up to 3 Hz; amplitudes up to 15 arcsec on              the sky; and a duty cycle of 87% at the above values.

Maximum 10 arcmin diameter on the bottom port, and 7 arcmin diameter on the side ports due to science fold mirror size.              Limiting factors on FOV are the diameter of the central openings of the WFS mounting rings in the WFS, the portholes in              the ISS, and the Science Fold Mirror diameter. PWFS can also vignette the beam - the PWFS can reach an outer radius = 7              arcmin before one edge of their field starts to be vignetted (the 14 arcmin diameter is slightly larger than the              instrument FOV because the PWFS are upstream of the Science Fold and ISS ports).

There is also a sky periscope at              the center of the secondary mirror for IR instruments to see sky rather than the primary's central obstruction. This              periscope is shuttered for optical instruments.

It was first built to support the Voyager missions and is now the US national facility for infrared astronomy, providing              continued support to planetary, solar neighborhood, and deep space applications. The IRTF is operated by the University              of Hawaii under a cooperative agreement with NASA. According to the IRTF's time allocation rules, at least 50% of the              observing time is devoted to planetary science.                          The IRTF is a 3.2 m classical Cassegrain telescope. The Cassegrain focus f/ratio is f/38 and the             primary mirror f/ratio is 2.5. Several aspects of the design of IRTF are optimized for IR observations. The secondary mirror              is undersized to prevent the instrument from seeing the thermal emission from the telescope structure around the primary mirror.              The primary mirror itself is 126"" in diameter, but only the center 118"" is used. A small mirror in the center of the secondary              mirror prevents the instrument from seeing its own thermal emission. The f/ratio is long to have a small secondary mirror,              again to minimize the telescope's thermal emission. The mirror coatings are chosen to have minimal thermal emission. The emissivity              of the telescope is usually below 4%. The secondary mirror is mounted on a chopping mechanism to rapidly switch the pointing of              the telescope from target to sky at up to 4 Hz.                          The IRTF is mounted on a large English yoke equatorial mount. The mount is very stiff, reducing flexure and allowing for accurate              pointing of the telescope. Since the telescope is on an equatorial mount, the telescope can observe targets through the zenith without              concern for field rotation. The yoke mount prevents the telescope from pointing north of +69 degrees declination. Since the telescope             was primarily intended for planetary science, this restriction was considered to be acceptable. Since the telescope is on a heavy              mounting, it is relatively immune from vibration or wind shake.

Keck Observatory.                  Instrument Host Overview ========================   The Keck I telescope began science operations in May, 1993.  It   was built through the W. M. Keck Foundation and is operated by the   California Association for Research in Astronomy which includes   the University of California, the California Institute of   Technology and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.   The Keck I is located at the W. M. Keck Observatory near the   summit of Mauna Kea, Hawaii. The geodetic coordinates of the   telescope are:      Longitude    : 155d 28.4' W     Latitude     : +19d 49.6' N     Altitude:    : 4124m     Mean seeing  : about 0.5 arcseconds full-width-half-max in the                    K-band    The overview and location given here are reproduced from the   W. M. Keck Observatory web site, http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/.   Telescope Properties --------------------   The primary mirror comprises 36 hexagonal segments.  Each segment   is 1.8 meters, measured across the corners.  The maximum diameter   of the primary mirror is 10.5 meters, and its focal length is 17.5   meters.    The telescope has 2 secondary mirrors.  The f/15 secondary mirror   forms a Richey Chretien system with the primary mirror.  It can be   used directly with an instrument mounted at the rear of the   support structure for the primary mirror or with a flat tertiary   mirror for a bent Cassegrain or Nasmyth focus.    The f/25 secondary mirror is used with the infrared instruments at   Keck I. The gold-plated mirror has a central hole to reduce the   reflection of radiation to the detector from beyond the edge of   the primary mirror or from the central obstruction for chop angles   up to +/-150 arcseconds. A chopping mechanism resides behind this   secondary mirror and does not obstruct the detector.  As the   chopping mechanism tilts, the image moves on the detector.  This   provides a way to rapidly center a target on the detector, then   chop to a nearby part of sky without moving the telescope. The   Keck Observatory website provides a tutorial for the chopping   mechanism,   http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/inst/tools/chp/Chopping.html.    The optical features of the f/15 and f/25 secondary mirror are:                                   f/15   f/25                                  -----  ------     Focal length (m)           : 149.6  249.7     Scale (mm/arcsec)          : 0.725  1.211     Field diameter (arcmin)    : 20     10     Field diameter (mm)        : 870    727     Radius of curvature* (m)   : 2.14   0.82    The telescope properties given here are reproduced from the Keck   Telescope and Facility Instrument Guide, available at   http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/observing/kecktelgde/ktelinstupdate.pdf.

The telescope uses the heliostat              at the top of its main tower to direct the sun's light down a long shaft to the primary mirrors. The distinctive diagonal shaft continues underground,              where the telescope's primary mirror is located. Tip-tilt correction and low order wavefront correction is available with a number of portable optical benches.              These are primarily used with the Main spectrograph and the Solar Stellar spectrograph on the Main telescope, but due to their compact mounting they could be              used with other telescopes and instruments in the facility.                          The third mirror of the main telescope which sends the light down into the observing room can be moved above three different positions. Two of these have a              vacuum spectrograph beneath them, one of 18 meter deep and the other 4 meter deep with lower resolution but higher light throughput. These two spectrographs are              able to rotate to compensate for the rotation of the image caused by the use of a heliostat. The third position can only be equipped with a static optical table              with no image rotation correction and is therefore rarely used.         ",,

Its primary mirror consists of 36 individual hexagonal segments that together act as a single mirror. The light collecting mirror surface area of GTC is equivalent to that of a telescope with a 10.4m diameter single monolithic mirror. Thanks to its huge collecting area and advanced engineering the GTC classes amongst the best performing telescopes for astronomical research.  The GTC has also a secondary mirror and a tertiary mirror that together with the primary mirror produce the telescope focal plane in the focal station of choice. The scientific instruments that are placed in the focal station then analyse and detect the light, and store the final data.  The telescope mount, a large mechanical, steel structure that holds the mirrors, allows rotational movements of the telescope along a horizontal and vertical axis. This movement has to be extremely precise in order to keep the stars projected stably onto the detector. The telescope is designed so that it is able to observe the optical and infrared light ranges.  GTC will be the last of the generation of so called 8 to 10 meter-class telescopes. Therefore it has tried to improved the design of the predecessors, learning from their experiences.  GTC is the largest telescope thanks to its huge light collecting surface of 75.7 square meters (73 m2 effective area). Apart from its large collecting surface another key feature is the exquisite image quality that the telescope delivers and therefore it can exploit the good sky quality to its maximum. The good image quality is made possible thanks to the active adjustment of the optics. This active optics allows the alignment, deformation and movement the individual segments that form the primary mirror, as well as the alignment of the secondary mirror so as to always keep their optimal position independently of the external conditions (climate, temperature, gravity, manufacture faults, etc).",,

The mount is an altitude-azimuth type for compatibility with the mirror support cell contributed by the Multi-Mirror Telescope Observatory.  Both axes are driven by DC servo motors directly coupled to friction rollers.  The CCD instrument stage is also rotated under computer control.  The telescope was fabricated in the University Research Instrumentation Center (URIC).  The optical configuration is f/2.7 folded prime focus with a flat secondary that locates the focal plane in the center of the optical truss near the altitude axis.  This shortened the telescope enough to make the dome building affordable, and the flat secondary preserves the fast f/number of the primary mirror.  The coma corrector designed by R. A. Buchroeder is a modified Klee design of 5 spherical lens elements plus a filter transmitting longward of the B bandpass.  The filter greatly simplifies lens design and reduces sky background while not significantly reducing the peak-pixel brightness of asteroids.
