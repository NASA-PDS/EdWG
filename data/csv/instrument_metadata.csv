Antenna Microwave Subsystem     --------------------------------       70-m Antennas: Each 70-m antenna has three feed cones       installed in a structure at the center of the main reflector.       The feeds are positioned 120 degrees apart on a circle.       Selection of the feed is made by rotation of the       subreflector.  A dichroic mirror assembly, half on the S-band       cone and half on the X-band cone, permits simultaneous use of       the S- and X-band frequencies.  The third cone is devoted to       R&D and more specialized work.         The Antenna Microwave Subsystem (AMS) accepts the received S-       and X-band signals at the feed horn and transmits them       through polarizer plates to an orthomode transducer.  The       polarizer plates are adjusted so that the signals are       directed to a pair of redundant amplifiers for each       frequency, thus allowing simultaneous reception of signals in       two orthogonal polarizations.  For S-band these are two Block       IVA S-band Traveling Wave Masers (TWMs); for X-band the       amplifiers are Block IIA TWMs.         34-m STD Antennas: These antennas have two feed horns, one       for S-band signals and one for X-band.  The horns are mounted       on a cone which is fixed in relation to the subreflector.  A       dichroic plate mounted above the horns directs energy from       the subreflector into the proper horn.         The AMS directs the received S- and X-band signals through       polarizer plates and on to amplification.  There are two       Block III S-band TWMs and two Block I X-band TWMs.         34-m HEF Antennas: Unlike the other antennas, the 34-m HEF       uses a single feed for both S- and X-band.  Simultaneous S-       and X-band receive as well as X-band transmit is possible       thanks to the presence of an S/X 'combiner' which acts as a       diplexer.  For S-band, RCP or LCP is user selected through a       switch so neither a polarizer nor an orthomode transducer is       needed.  X-band amplification options include two Block II       TWMs or an HEMT Low Noise Amplifier (LNA).  S-band       amplification is provided by an FET LNA.         DSCC Receiver-Exciter Subsystem     -------------------------------       The Receiver-Exciter Subsystem is composed of three groups of       equipment: the closed-loop receiver group, the open-loop       receiver group, and the RF monitor group.  This subsystem is       controlled by the Receiver-Exciter Controller (REC) which       communicates directly with the DMC for predicts and OCI       reception and status reporting.         The exciter generates the S-band signal (or X-band for the       34-m HEF only) which is provided to the Transmitter Subsystem       for the spacecraft uplink signal.  It is tunable under       command of the Digitally Controlled Oscillator (DCO) which       receives predicts from the Metric Data Assembly (MDA).         The diplexer in the signal path between the transmitter and       the feed horn for all three antennas (used for simultaneous       transmission and reception) may be configured such that it is       out of the received signal path (in listen-only or bypass       mode) in order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio in the       receiver system.         Closed Loop Receivers: The Block IV receiver-exciter at the       70-m stations allows for two receiver channels, each capable       of L-Band (e.g., 1668 MHz frequency or 18 cm wavelength),       S-band, or X-band reception, and an S-band exciter for       generation of uplink signals through the low-power or       high-power transmitter.  The Block III receiver-exciter at       the 34-m STD stations allows for two receiver channels, each       capable of S-band or X-band reception and an exciter used to       generate an uplink signal through the low-power transmitter.       The receiver-exciter at the 34-m HEF stations allows for one       channel only.         The closed-loop receivers provide the capability for rapid       acquisition of a spacecraft signal and telemetry lockup.  In       order to accomplish acquisition within a short time, the       receivers are predict driven to search for, acquire, and       track the downlink automatically.  Rapid acquisition       precludes manual tuning though that remains as a backup       capability.  The subsystem utilizes FFT analyzers for rapid       acquisition.  The predicts are NSS generated, transmitted to       the CMC which sends them to the Receiver-Exciter Subsystem       where two sets can be stored.  The receiver starts       acquisition at uplink time plus one round-trip-light-time or       at operator specified times.  The receivers may also be       operated from the LMC without a local operator attending       them.  The receivers send performance and status data,       displays, and event messages to the LMC.         Either the exciter synthesizer signal or the simulation (SIM)       synthesizer signal is used as the reference for the Doppler       extractor in the closed-loop receiver systems, depending on       the spacecraft being tracked (and Project guidelines).  The       SIM synthesizer is not ramped; instead it uses one constant       frequency, the Track Synthesizer Frequency (TSF), which is an       average frequency for the entire pass.         The closed-loop receiver AGC loop can be configured to one of       three settings: narrow, medium, or wide.  It will be       configured such that the expected amplitude changes are       accommodated with minimum distortion.  The loop bandwidth       (2BLo) will be configured such that the expected phase       changes can be accommodated while maintaining the best       possible loop SNR.         Open-Loop Receivers: There are two types of Radio Science       Open-Loop Receivers (OLR) in use.  At 70-m and 34-m HEF       stations the OLR is a a dedicated four channel, narrow-band       receiver which provides amplified and downconverted video       band signals to the DSCC Spectrum Processing Subsystem (DSP);       it sometimes goes by the designation 'RIV'.  At 34-m STD       stations (DSS 42 and DSS 61) the OLR is an older system, the       Multi-Mission Receiver (MMR), which provides two channels of       narrow-band receiver output.  Both OLR systems are described       in detail below under 'Electronics - DSN'; here the overview       continues only for the RIV system.         The 70-m and 34-m HEF OLR utilizes a fixed first Local       Oscillator (LO) frequency and a tunable second LO frequency       to minimize phase noise and improve frequency stability.  The       OLR consists of an RF-to-IF downconverter located in the       antenna, an IF selection switch (IVC), and a Radio Science       IF-VF downconverter (RIV) located in the SPC.  The RF-IF       downconverters in the 70-m antennas are equipped for four IF       channels: S-RCP, S-LCP, X-RCP, and X-LCP.  The 34-m HEF       stations are equipped with a two-channel RF-IF: S-band and       X-band.  The IVC switches the IF input between the 70-m and       34-m HEF antennas.         The RIV contains the tunable second LO, a set of video       bandpass filters, IF attenuators, and a controller (RIC).       The LO tuning is done via DSP control of the POCA/PLO       combination based on a predict set.  The POCA is a       Programmable Oscillator Control Assembly and the PLO is a       Programmable Local Oscillator (commonly called the DANA       synthesizer).  The bandpass filters are selectable via the       DSP.  The RIC provides an interface between the DSP and the       RIV.  It is controlled from the LMC via the DSP.  The RIC       selects the filter and attenuator settings and provides       monitor data to the DSP.  The RIC could also be manually       controlled from the front panel in case the electronic       interface to the DSP is lost.         RF Monitor -- SSI and PPM: The RF monitor group of the       Receiver-Exciter Subsystem provides spectral measurements       using the Spectral Signal Indicator (SSI) and measurements of       the received channel system temperature and spacecraft signal       level using the Precision Power Monitor (PPM).         The SSI provides a local display of the received signal       spectrum at a dedicated terminal at the DSCC and routes these       same data to the DSP which routes them to NOCC for remote       display at JPL for real-time monitoring and RIV/DSP       configuration verification.  These displays are used to       validate Radio Science Subsystem data at the DSS, NOCC, and       Mission Support Areas.  The SSI configuration is controlled       by the DSP and a duplicate of the SSI spectrum appears on the       LMC via the DSP.  During real-time operations the SSI data       also serve as a quick-look science data type for Radio       Science experiments.         The PPM measures system noise temperatures (SNT) using a       Noise Adding Radiometer (NAR) and downlink signal levels       using the Signal Level Estimator (SLE).  The PPM accepts its       input from the closed-loop receiver.  The SNT is measured by       injecting known amounts of noise power into the signal path       and comparing the total power with the noise injection 'on'       against the total power with the noise injection 'off.' That       operation is based on the fact that receiver noise power is       directly proportional to temperature; thus measuring the       relative increase in noise power due to the presence of a       calibrated thermal noise source allows direct calculation of       SNT.  Signal level is measured by calculating an FFT to       estimate the SNR between the signal level and the receiver       noise floor where the power is known from the SNT       measurements.         There is one PPM controller at the SPC which is used to       control all SNT measurements.  The SNT integration time can       be selected to represent the time required for a measurement       of 30K to have a one-sigma uncertainty of 0.3K or 1%.         DSCC Transmitter Subsystem     --------------------------       The Transmitter Subsystem accepts the S-band frequency       exciter signal from the Block III or Block IV Receiver-       Exciter Subsystem exciter and amplifies it to the required       transmit output level.  The amplified signal is routed via       the diplexer through the feed horn to the antenna and then       focused and beamed to the spacecraft.         The Transmitter Subsystem power capabilities range from 18 kw       to 400 kw.  Power levels above 18 kw are available only at       70-m stations.         DSCC Tracking Subsystem     -----------------------       The Tracking Subsystem primary functions are to acquire and       maintain communications with the spacecraft and to generate       and format radiometric data containing Doppler and range.         The DSCC Tracking Subsystem (DTK) receives the carrier       signals and ranging spectra from the Receiver-Exciter       Subsystem.  The Doppler cycle counts are counted, formatted,       and transmitted to JPL in real time.  Ranging data are also       transmitted to JPL in real time.  Also contained in these       blocks is the AGC information from the Receiver-Exciter       Subsystem.  The Radio Metric Data Conditioning Team (RMDCT)       at JPL produces an Archival Tracking Data File (ATDF) which       contains Doppler and ranging data.         In addition, the Tracking Subsystem receives from the CMC       frequency predicts (used to compute frequency residuals and       noise estimates), receiver tuning predicts (used to tune the       closed-loop receivers), and uplink tuning predicts (used to       tune the exciter).  From the LMC, it receives configuration       and control directives as well as configuration and status       information on the transmitter, microwave, and frequency and       timing subsystems.         The Metric Data Assembly (MDA) controls all of the DTK       functions supporting the uplink and downlink activities.  The       MDA receives uplink predicts and controls the uplink tuning       by commanding the DCO.  The MDA also controls the Sequential       Ranging Assembly (SRA).  It formats the Doppler and range       measurements and provides them to the GCF for transmission to       NOCC.         The Sequential Ranging Assembly (SRA) measures the round trip       light time (RTLT) of a radio signal traveling from a ground       tracking station to a spacecraft and back.  From the RTLT,       phase, and Doppler data, the spacecraft range can be       determined.  A coded signal is modulated on an uplink carrier       and transmitted to the spacecraft where it is detected and       transponded back to the ground station.  As a result, the       signal received at the tracking station is delayed by its       round trip through space and shifted in frequency by the       Doppler effect due to the relative motion between the       spacecraft and the tracking station on Earth.         DSCC Spectrum Processing Subsystem (DSP)     ----------------------------------------       The DSCC Spectrum Processing Subsystem (DSP) located at the       SPC digitizes and records the narrowband output data from the       RIV.  It consists of a Narrow Band Occultation Converter       (NBOC) containing four Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs), a       ModComp CLASSIC computer processor called the Spectrum       Processing Assembly (SPA), and several magnetic tape drives.       Magnetic tapes containing DSP output are known as Original       Data Records (ODRs).  Electronic near real-time data       transmission (known as an Original Data Stream, or ODS) may       be possible in certain circumstances.         The DSP is operated through the LMC.  Using the       SPA-Radioscience (SPA-R) software, the DSP allows for       real-time frequency and time offsets (while in RUN mode) and,       if necessary, snap tuning between the two frequency ranges       transmitted by the spacecraft: coherent and non-coherent.       The DSP receives Radio Science frequency predicts from the       CMC, allows for multiple predict set archiving (up to 60       sets) at the SPA, and allows for manual predict generation       and editing.  It accepts configuration and control data from       the LMC, provides display data to the LMC, and transmits the       signal spectra from the SSI as well as status information to       NOCC and the Project Mission Support Area (MSA) via the GCF       data lines.  The DSP records the digitized narrowband samples       and the supporting header information (i.e., time tags, POCA       frequencies, etc.) on 9-track magnetic tapes in 6250 or 1600       bpi GCR format.         Through the DSP-RIC interface the DSP controls the RIV filter       selection and attenuation levels.  It also receives RIV       performance monitoring via the RIC.  In case of failure of       the DSP-RIC interface, the RIV can be controlled manually       from the front panel.         All the RIV and DSP control parameters and configuration       directives are stored in the SPA in a macro-like file called       an 'experiment directive' table.  A number of default       directives exist in the DSP for the major Radio Science       experiments.  Operators can create their own table entries.         Items such as verification of the configuration of the prime       open-loop recording subsystem, the selection of the required       predict sets, and proper system performance prior to the       recording periods will be checked in real-time at JPL via the       NOCC displays using primarily the remote SSI display at NOCC       and the NRV displays.  Because of this, transmission of the       DSP/SSI monitor information is enabled prior to the start of       recording.  The specific run time and tape recording times       will be identified in the Sequence of Events (SOE) and/or DSN       Keyword File.         The DSP can be used to duplicate ODRs.  It also has the       capability to play back a certain section of the recorded       data after conclusion of the recording periods.         DSCC Frequency and Timing Subsystem     -----------------------------------       The Frequency and Timing Subsystem (FTS) provides all       frequency and timing references required by the other DSCC       subsystems.  It contains four frequency standards of which       one is prime and the other three are backups.  Selection of       the prime standard is done via the CMC.  Of these four       standards, two are hydrogen masers followed by clean-up loops       (CUL) and two are cesium standards.  These four standards all       feed the Coherent Reference Generator (CRG) which provides       the frequency references used by the rest of the complex.  It       also provides the frequency reference to the Master Clock       Assembly (MCA) which in turn provides time to the Time       Insertion and Distribution Assembly (TID) which provides UTC       and SIM-time to the complex.         JPL's ability to monitor the FTS at each DSCC is limited to       the MDA calculated Doppler pseudo-residuals, the Doppler       noise, the SSI, and to a system which uses the Global       Positioning System (GPS).  GPS receivers at each DSCC receive       a one-pulse-per-second pulse from the station's (hydrogen       maser referenced) FTS and a pulse from a GPS satellite at       scheduled times.  After compensating for the satellite signal       delay, the timing offset is reported to JPL where a database       is kept.  The clock offsets stored in the JPL database are       given in microseconds; each entry is a mean reading of       measurements from several GPS satellites and a time tag       associated with the mean reading.  The clock offsets provided       include those of SPC 10 relative to UTC (NIST), SPC 40       relative to SPC 10, etc.       Optics - DSN   ============     Performance of DSN ground stations depends primarily on size of     the antenna and capabilities of electronics.  These are     summarized in the following set of tables.  Note that 64-m     antennas were upgraded to 70-m between 1986 and 1989.     Beamwidth is half-power full angular width.  Polarization is     circular; L denotes left circular polarization (LCP), and R     denotes right circular polarization (RCP).

For telecommunications, the                transmitting frequency would be in the range 7145-7190                MHz, the power would typically be 20 kW, and the gain                would be about 72.6 dB (70-m antenna).  When ground                transmitters are used in spacecraft radio science                experiments, the details of transmitter and antenna                performance rarely impact the results.       Electronics - DSN   =================       DSCC Open-Loop Receiver (RIV)     -----------------------------       The open loop receiver block diagram shown below is for the       RIV system at 70-m and 34-m High-Efficiency (HEF) antenna       sites.  Input signals at both S- and X-band are mixed to       approximately 300 MHz by fixed-frequency local oscillators       near the antenna feed.  Based on a tuning prediction file,       the POCA controls the DANA synthesizer, the output of which       (after multiplication) mixes the 300 MHz IF to 50 MHz for       amplification.

No information on specific calibration     activities is available.  Nominal performance specifications     are shown in the tables above.  Additional information may be     available in [DSN810-5].       Prior to each tracking pass, station operators perform a series     of calibrations to ensure that systems meet specifications for     that operational period.  Included in these calibrations is     measurement of receiver system temperature in the configuration     to be employed during the pass.  Results of these calibrations     are recorded in (hard copy) Controller's Logs for each pass.       The nominal procedure for initializing open-loop receiver     attenuator settings is described below.  In cases where widely     varying signal levels are expected, the procedure may be     modified in advance or real-time adjustments may be made to     attenuator settings.         Open-Loop Receiver Attenuation Calibration     ------------------------------------------       The open-loop receiver attenuator calibrations are performed       to establish the output of the open-loop receivers at a level       that will not saturate the analog-to-digital converters.  To       achieve this, the calibration is done using a test signal       generated by the exciter/translator that is set to the peak       predicted signal level for the upcoming pass.  Then the       output level of the receiver's video band spectrum envelope       is adjusted to the level determined by equation (3) below (to       five-sigma).  Note that the SNR in the equation (2) is in dB       while the SNR in equation (3) is linear.              Pn = -198.6 + 10*log(SNT) + 10*log(1.2*Fbw)              (1)              SNR = Ps - Pn                               (SNR in dB)  (2)              Vrms = sqrt(SNR + 1)/[1 + 0.283*sqrt(SNR)]  (SNR linear) (3)              where    Fbw = receiver filter bandwidth (Hz)                     Pn  = receiver noise power (dBm)                     Ps  = signal power (dBm)                     SNT = system noise temperature (K)                     SNR = predicted signal-to-noise ratio       Operational Considerations - DSN   ================================     The DSN is a complex and dynamic 'instrument.' Its performance     for Radio Science depends on a number of factors from equipment     configuration to meteorological conditions.  No specific     information on 'operational considerations' can be given here.       Operational Modes - DSN   =======================       DSCC Antenna Mechanical Subsystem     ---------------------------------       Pointing of DSCC antennas may be carried out in several ways.       For details see the subsection 'DSCC Antenna Mechanical       Subsystem' in the 'Subsystem' section.  Binary pointing is       the preferred mode for tracking spacecraft; pointing predicts       are provided, and the antenna simply follows those.  With       CONSCAN, the antenna scans conically about the optimum       pointing direction, using closed-loop receiver signal       strength estimates as feedback.  In planetary mode, the       system interpolates from three (slowly changing) RA-DEC       target coordinates; this is 'blind' pointing since there is       no feedback from a detected signal.  In sidereal mode, the       antenna tracks a fixed point on the celestial sphere.  In       'precision' mode, the antenna pointing is adjusted using an       optical feedback system.  It is possible on most antennas to       freeze z-axis motion of the subreflector to minimize phase       changes in the received signal.         DSCC Receiver-Exciter Subsystem     -------------------------------       The diplexer in the signal path between the transmitter and       the feed horns on all three antennas may be configured so       that it is out of the received signal path in order to       improve the signal-to-noise ratio in the receiver system.       This is known as the 'listen-only' or 'bypass' mode.         Closed-Loop vs. Open-Loop Reception     -----------------------------------       Radio Science data can be collected in two modes: closed-       loop, in which a phase-locked loop receiver tracks the       spacecraft signal, or open-loop, in which a receiver samples       and records a band within which the desired signal presumably       resides.  Closed-loop data are collected using Closed-Loop       Receivers, and open-loop data are collected using Open-Loop       Receivers in conjunction with the DSCC Spectrum Processing       Subsystem (DSP).  See the Subsystems section for further       information.         Closed-Loop Receiver AGC Loop     -----------------------------       The closed-loop receiver AGC loop can be configured to one of       three settings: narrow, medium, or wide.  Ordinarily it is       configured so that expected signal amplitude changes are       accommodated with minimum distortion.  The loop bandwidth is       ordinarily configured so that expected phase changes can be       accommodated while maintaining the best possible loop SNR.         Coherent vs. Non-Coherent Operation     -----------------------------------       The frequency of the signal transmitted from the spacecraft       can generally be controlled in two ways -- by locking to a       signal received from a ground station or by locking to an       on-board oscillator.  These are known as the coherent (or       'two-way') and non-coherent ('one-way') modes, respectively.       Mode selection is made at the spacecraft, based on commands       received from the ground.  When operating in the coherent       mode, the transponder carrier frequency is derived from the       received uplink carrier frequency with a 'turn-around ratio'       typically of 240/221.  In the non-coherent mode, the downlink       carrier frequency is derived from the spacecraft on-board       crystal-controlled oscillator.  Either closed-loop or       open-loop receivers (or both) can be used with either       spacecraft frequency reference mode.  Closed-loop reception       in two-way mode is usually preferred for routine tracking.       Occasionally the spacecraft operates coherently while two       ground stations receive the 'downlink' signal; this is       sometimes known as the 'three-way' mode.         DSCC Spectrum Processing Subsystem (DSP)     ----------------------------------------       The DSP can operate in four sampling modes with from 1 to 4       input signals.  Input channels are assigned to ADC inputs       during DSP configuration.

The       nominal input to the Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) is       +/-10 volts, but the precise scaling between input voltages       and output digitized samples is usually irrelevant for       analysis; the digital data are generally referenced to a       known noise or signal level within the data stream itself --       for example, the thermal noise output of the radio receivers       which has a known system noise temperature (SNT).  Raw       samples comprise the data block in each DSP record; a header       record (presently 83 16-bit words) contains ancillary       information such as:         time tag for the first sample in the data block RMS values of       receiver signal levels and ADC outputs POCA frequency and       drift rate         Closed-Loop System     ------------------       Closed-loop data are recorded in Archival Tracking Data Files       (ATDFs), as well as certain secondary products such as the       Orbit Data File (ODF).  The ATDF Tracking Logical Record       contains 117 entries including status information and       measurements of ranging, Doppler," and signal strength.

urn:esa:psa:context:instrument:gio.did,DUST IMPACT DETECTOR for GIO,DUST IMPACT DETECTOR,"         INSTRUMENT OVERVIEW       ===================       The Dust Impact Detector System consists of six subsystems with the       primary aim of recording the impacts of all particles of significant       mass incident on the Giotto probe.  Mounter on Giotto's dust shields,       the detectors determine the mass spectrum.  The capacitor impact       system records the discharge of a parallel plate capacitor when       impacted by a particle whose mass exceeds the threshold value.  The       sensor is bonded to the outer surface of the front shield.  The MSM       and RSM subsystems of the DIDSY were designed and built at the       University of Kent at Canterbury but the acoustic design of the front       shield was the responsibility of the Rutherford Applied Physics       Laboratory.  Three 200 kHz longitudinally resonant PZT 5A piezoelectric       microphone elements are attached to the rear of the spacecraft front       shield. Each crystal is contained in a hermetically sealed stainless       steel container. Impacts on the spacecraft rear kevlar shield are       sensed by a fourth (RSM) sensor identical to the front ones.  The IPM       sensor consist of two impact ionization detectors each with a sensitive       area of 59.6 cm**2 and a piezoelectric detector supplied by the       University of Kent at Canterbury. The entire system was designed and       developed by the Max-Planck-Institute-Fuer-Kernphysik with the help       of the Technical University of Munich.  The sensor is attached to the       front shield of the spacecraft.           SCIENCE OBJECTIVES       ==================       DIDSY attempts to measure the mass efflux from a comet.   In order       to determine the mass spectrum, a collection of instruments,       sensitive to different properties are used.   Two broad groups measure       the particles directly (gas and dust) or the plasma generated by both.       In the former case, the discrete data represent a set measured values       for a single event.   These can be collected to form the mass spectrum       of the particles.  In the latter case, a 1 cm**2 gold-plated electrode       measures the plasma.         CALIBRATION DESCRIPTION       =======================       A program of laboratory measurements was carried out to determine       the performance of different shield designs.   A revised design       incorporates a 35 degree sector of the annular shield which remains       'clean' (DID 4). It is then possible to get a relatively true signal.       There is also a large sector (325 degrees) that is treated as a       single surface and measured by detectors DID 2 and DID 3.

ELECTRONICS       ===========       The Cetral Data Formatter (CDF) performs functions for each detector.       The CIS electronics exhibits one of two processes.   If a particle       strikes the sensor, a conduction path is set up by the formation of       a plasma. The RSM/MSM electronics subsystem performs both analog and       digital processing of the signals arising at each sensor from a       particle impact. The signals from the IPM subsystems are processed in       parallel to reduce dead-time.   The IPM/M electronics also performs       both analog and digital processing.         PLATFORM MOUNTING DESCRIPTION       =============================       DIDSY is mounted inside the dust shields along the front of the       spacecraft.         INSTRUMENT SECTION DESCRIPTION       ==============================       The DIDSY system has been designed so that, as far as possible, the       individual subsystems may operate independently of each other for       operational reliability. At the same time, by operating in overlapping       ranges of incident particle mass, comparison of results from the       different subsystems will yield greater 'scientific' reliability.         Despite independent operation, some coincidence information for       individual impacts is exchanged between Subsystems for event       validation. However, the failure of one detection subsystem should       not in any way affect the correct operation of another. The Central       Data Formatter (CDF) performs a primary task of collecting data from       each subsystem, processing it as required, and passing it into the       telemetry stream. In addition to handling data formatting the CDF       also supplies power to each subsystem via a separate current-limiter       so that, for example, a short-circuit in one subsystem does not       affect operation of the others. Unregulated power is supplied by the       spacecraft power subsystem on a single current-tripped supply.         Data within the DIDSY subsystem are divided into two broad categories,       namely: (i) discrete data, which represent a set of measured values       for single event detected by one subsystem, and (ii) cumulative data,       which represent the total event amplitude distribution from each sensor       and are generated by accumulation of discrete data events within the       CDF. Such an approach results from the telemetry allocation, which       makes it impossible to transmit full information on all detected       impacts, except at very low impact rates. A limited quantity of       discrete data are mixed with the cumulative data and passed into the       spacecraft telemetry stream by the CDF every 1.3 s during the last       hour before closest approach and every 2.83 s prior to this. A brief       description of the constituent elements of the DIDSY system is given       below.         -----------------------------------------------------------------------       Constituent elements of DIDSY         Designation      Description                Location          Subsystem       -----------------------------------------------------------------------          DID 1,1A/B Impact plasma, momentum      Located in cut-out in   IPM/M,                   and ambient plasma sensor    front shield            IPM/P        DID 2,3,4  Piezoelectric momentum       Various locations       MSM                   sensors                      on front shield        DID 5      Piezoelectric momentum       Rear shield             RSM                   sensors        DID 6      Central Data Formatter       Experiment platform        DID 7      Capacitor Impact Sensor      Front shield            CIS        DID 8      Roll-up cover                Front shield over DID 1       -----------------------------------------------------------------------          ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The second element was a set of ground       antennas and associated electronics, most of which were in       Australia.  The spacecraft element of the experiment is       specified below.             Instrument Id               : RSS           Instrument Host Id          : GIO           Instrument Name             : GIOTTO RADIOSCIENCE EXPERIMENT           Instrument Type             : RADIO SCIENCE         The Giotto Radio Science Experiment (GRE) utilized       instrumentation with elements on the spacecraft and on       Earth.  Much of this was shared equipment, being used for       routine telecommunications as well as for Radio Science.       The experiment is described in more detail by       [EDENHOFERETAL1986A] and [EDENHOFERETAL1987A].         The spacecraft radio system was constructed around a       redundant pair of transponders which received at S-band       (2.3 GHz, 13 cm wavelength) and transmitted at both S-band       and X-band (8.4 GHz, 3.6 cm wavelength) frequencies.  The       transmitted frequency during the Halley encounter was       controlled by an on-board oscillator; at other times it was       controlled by a signal transmitted from the ground.         Each transponder included a receiver, command detector,       exciter, and low-power amplifier.  The transponders       provided the usual uplink command and downlink data       transmission capabilities.         Traveling wave tube amplifiers, driven at saturation,       amplified the transponder output before the signals were       radiated via a high-gain antenna (HGA).  The HGA offset       reflector had a diameter of 1.46 m and was despun with       respect to the spacecraft body.  HGA polarization was       right circularly polarized for S-band up/downlink and for       X-band downlink.  S-band beamwidth was about 5 degrees;       X-band beamwidth was about 2 degrees.         Ground stations included antennas, associated electronics,       and operational systems at two complexes in Australia.  The       prime system for GRE was the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN)       station near Canberra; its 64-m antenna is known as DSS 43.       Geodetic coordinates for the 64-m antenna are 148 deg, 58       min, 48 sec E longitude and 35 deg, 24 min, 14 sec S       latitude.  Raw data from the DSN tracking system included       Doppler measurements along the line of sight to the       spacecraft.  Raw data from the open loop receiver system       included digital samples of baseband output.  The second       system was the 64-m antenna operated by the Australian       CSIRO near Parkes; it served as the primary Giotto ground       receiving facility for the European Space Agency in       addition to its role as a receiving site for the GRE       [HALL1986].         Once the radio signal from the spacecraft had been captured       by a ground antenna, it was amplified by cryogenic maser       amplifiers.  Two measurement options were then available:           (1) Open-loop Data Acquisition         (2) Closed-loop Data Acquisition           Open-Loop Data Acquisition       --------------------------           Open-loop data acquisition is performed by filtering and         then downconverting the received carrier signal to         baseband, where it is sampled for subsequent manipulation         in digital form.  The open-loop receiver is tuned on the         basis of frequency predictions that take into account the         best estimate of the carrier frequency transmitted by the         spacecraft and Doppler corrections based on relative         spacecraft-to-ground motion.  The quantized samples can         then be recorded on magnetic tape.           Closed-Loop Data Acquisition       ----------------------------           Closed-loop data acquisition is performed with a phase-         locked loop receiver; it is usually employed when the         spacecraft is operating in its 'coherent' mode.  'Two-way'         Doppler shifts are determined by comparing an estimate of         the downlink carrier frequency from the phase-locked loop         with a reference from the ground station's frequency and         timing subsystem.  Since the station frequency reference         is also used to generate the uplink carrier, the         determination can be as accurate as the fundamental         station clock -- typically a hydrogen maser frequency         standard and, therefore, more stable than the crystal         oscillator on board the spacecraft.           The Doppler integration time needed to achieve a         particular signal-to-noise ratio controls the time         interval between successive measurements.  Amplitude of         the received signal is estimated by sampling the         calibrated automatic gain control (AGC) voltage of the         phase-locked loop receiver's coherent AGC loop.           'One-way' closed-loop Doppler shifts are determined in         much the same way except that the downlink measurement         from the phase locked loop must be compared with an         estimate of the spacecraft carrier frequency; in this         case the accuracy is limited by the relative performance         of the reference oscillators on the ground and the         spacecraft.  Both frequency and amplitude measurements         obtained at the DSN station can then be recorded on         magnetic tape and/or transmitted electronically to JPL.         Files of data specifically intended for navigation and         radio science are derived from the raw measurements by         the DSN Radio Metric Data Conditioning Team.           Operation of the DSN radio science equipment is described         in more detail by [ASMAR&HERRERA1993].         The strength of a spacecraft carrier signal, and thus the       quality of the radio science data, depends on its modulation       state.  During the Halley encounter, only the X-band downlink       was activated; it was modulated with science data.  The link       budget for the GRE prime receiver at Canberra, Australia is       shown below [EDENHOFERETAL1986B]:                                                S-band   S-band    X-band                                            uplink  downlink  downlink                                            ------  --------  --------           Signal frequency (GHz)            2.117    2.299     8.429           TX power (dBm)                    73       36.7      43.2           Ground antenna gain (dB)          60.6     61.7      71.9           Propagation loss (dB)           -262.5   -263.2    -274.5           S/C antenna gain (dB)             25.3     26.3      39           RF losses (dB)                    -2.3     -1.9      -1.6           Signal level RX input (dBm)     -105.9   -140.4    -122           System noise temperature (dBK)    27.2     13.7      13.8           Boltzmann constant (dBm/HzK)    -198.6   -198.6    -198.6           Received S/No (dBHz)              65.5     44.5      62.8           Modulation loss (dB)               0       -3.6      -8.2           PLL bandwidth (dBHz)              15.4     16.8      16.8           Required C/N (dB)                 10       15        15           Margin (dB)                       40.1      9.1      22.8               Science Objectives       ==================       The primary objective of the Giotto Radio Science       Experiment was determination of the Halley mass fluence       resulting from atmospheric drag.  A second objective was       determining the electron content of the ionosphere of the       comet; this part of the experiment was badly degraded when       Giotto project management chose to operate only an X-band       downlink during the encounter.         Mass fluence was determined by measuring the change       in spacecraft radial velocity (with respect to receiving       stations on the Earth) during the encounter.  Velocity       changes were inferred from Doppler shifts in the received       signal.  Doppler shifts not in accord with the expected       trajectory could be interpreted as resulting from drag on       the spacecraft by dust and gas.         Passage of the radio wave through a plasma can also cause       Doppler shifts on the received signal.  The plasma effects       can be readily separated from other effects if measurements       are made at two well-separated radio frequencies.  The       inability to make measurements at S-band meant that only       indirect measurements and modeling could be used to infer       the density of charged particles in the Halley environment.         Calibration Descriptions       ========================       Several calibration measurements were carried out; most       were directed toward estimating the propagation effects of       charged particles along the ray path.         Earth Ionosphere Plasma Content       -------------------------------           VHF Faraday rotation measurements were made at Canberra         using the ETS-2 geostationary satellite.  These         measurements would provide a measure of the plasma         content in the Earth's ionosphere over Canberra.         Other Earth Atmospheric Effects       -------------------------------           Acquisition of data at two Earth sites (Canberra and         Parkes) ensured that local anomalies in propagation         conditions over a single antenna (such as changes in         the ionosphere) could be calibrated and removed.  The         results from Canberra and Parkes were very similar         [EDENHOFERETAL1987B].           Ray Path Reference       ------------------           The Sakigake spacecraft was tracked at S-band by the         DSS 42 antenna -- a 34-m antenna that is also part of         the Canberra DSN complex.  Since Sakigake was in the         same part of the sky as Giotto, differences in the         properties of the received signals would depend         primarily on the propagation conditions in the         immediate environment of Halley during the Giotto         encounter.           Vega Spacecraft Measurements       ----------------------------           Vega-1 and Vega-2 used dual-frequency radio methods to         obtain estimates of peak electron densities during         their encounters with Halley (2500 electrons per cubic         centimeter at 8890 km closest approach distance and         1500 el/cc at 8030 km, respectively).  Extrapolation         of these values to the Giotto flyby conditions gave         numbers consistent with simulation [EDENHOFERETAL1986C].           Asymptotic Spacecraft Trajectory Calibration       --------------------------------------------           Two-way Doppler and ranging data were acquired both         before and after the Halley encounter.  These showed         that the net change in radial velocity was 23.05 +/- 0.05         cm/sec during the encounter [EDENHOFERETAL1987B].           On-Board Oscillator Drift       -------------------------           Measured linear drift of the on-board Giotto oscillator         was about +1 Hz per minute [EDENHOFERETAL1987B].           Operational Considerations       ==========================       Giotto Project management chose to operate only the X-band       spacecraft transmitter during the Halley encounter.  This       made extraction of the electron content in the comet       environment extremely difficult, if not impossible       [EDENHOFERETAL1987B].         Instrument Section / Operating Mode Descriptions        ================================================       The instrument sections and modes for operation during the       Halley encounter period are shown below:               Section             Options         Mode           ----------------------------------------             Ground Equipment:             Antenna           64-m            N/A             Receiver          X-band          Open-Loop                                                 Closed-Loop           Spacecraft Equipment:             Antenna           High-Gain       N/A             Transponder                       Non-Coherent             Transmitter       X-band          N/A         The closed-loop and open-loop receivers were operated at       their maximum sampling rates (10 Hz and 50 kHz,       respectively).         During the pre- and post-encounter periods the system was       operated in the two-way coherent mode to obtain both       Doppler and ranging data.  Details on those operations       are not available.

urn:esa:psa:context:instrument:gio.hmc,HALLEY MULTICOLOUR CAMERA for GIO,HALLEY MULTICOLOUR CAMERA,"         Instrument Overview       ===================         The HMC utilizes a 16-cm modified Ritchey-Chretien telescope         with a 1.00-m focal length to image the sky onto a set of         linear-array detectors.  The telescope is mounted with its axis         perpendicular to the rotational axis of the spacecraft.  A 45-         degree mirror in front of the telescope, which rotates together         with the entire telescope assembly, allows the telescope to view         any direction from parallel to the spacecraft's axis of spin to         perpendicular to that axis.  Thus, depending on the rotational         orientation of the telescope, the spin of the spacecraft causes         the linear field of view of the camera to sweep out a circle on         the sky (when pointed nearly parallel to the axis of spin), or         an annulus on the sky (when pointed at intermediate directions),         or a rectangular strip (when pointed perpendicular to the axis         of spin).  A reticon detector with two rows of 936 pixels (30 by         375 microns each) has a linear field of view of 1.6 degrees and         was used primarily to search for the comet before the encounter.         Two CCDs (22.35 micron square pixels; 584 lines of 390 pixels)         were masked to provide two linear detectors on each CCD.  Each         linear detector was several pixels high and the readouts were         clocked to move the charge from line to line synchronized with         the effective motion of the image across the detector.  Three         detectors were fitted with fixed filters (red, blue, and clear)         and the third was fitted with a filter wheel containing a         variety of narrow-band filters.  In some modes, on-chip binning         was used to improve the signal-to-noise ratio at the expense of         reduced spatial resolution.  On-board electronics located the         brightest portion of each image and transmitted a region         centered on that point, discarding the periphery of each image.         Science Objectives       ==================         The technical goals of the experiment were first to obtain high-         quality images of the cometary nucleus in four colors with two         polarizations and secondarily to obtain images of the cometary         coma in a variety of narrow bandpasses.  The primary scientific         goal to be addressed with these images was to determine the         basic properties of the nucleus including the size and shape,         the morphology and topography of the surface, the photometric         properties of the surface, the rotational state, the degree of         heterogeneity in the outgassing, and the energy balance at the         surface.  The secondary scientific goal was to study the         properties of the inner coma including the production and         evolution of gas and dust, the scales of the relevant physical         processes, the size distribution of the dust, the chemistry of         the inner coma, and the temporal variability in the inner coma.         Calibration Description       =======================         Flat-fielding, or determining the responsivity matrix for each         pixel, was carried out using pre-flight exposures on the ground.         These were all taken without on-chip binning (i.e.  in SPF-0,         Super Pixel Format 0).  Because the detectors are one-         dimensional, defects in the responsivity matrix show up as         vertical lines in an image.  For detector C, the most frequently         used detector, the encounter data in both SDM and MDM were used,         by integrating parallel to the tracking, to locate vertical         lines in the images and the responsivity matrix was adjusted to         make these integrated brightnesses vary smoothly along the         window. Detectors B and D were strongly affected by blooming of         the charge in the pre-flight calibration exposures so only faint         exposures could be used and these required fitting of a         polynomial to the illumination.  The gain switch, used to reduce         the gain by a nominal factor 4 during non SPF-0 SDM         observations, was calibrated by comparing images of Jupiter         taken in SDM at both gains.  The ratio was 4.115, in good         agreement with ground-based tests prior to launch.  The absolute         calibration was carried out by observing bright stars, Jupiter,         and Venus while enroute to the comet.  The absolute fluxes from         the stars were obtained from published sources and, when not         available from these sources, by fitting black-body curves to         the known fluxes.  Observations of Venus and Jupiter were also         used together with published fluxes, taking into account the         variation with phase.  The final overall calibration is thought         to be accurate to about 5%.  See Thomas and Keller, 1990,         Applied Optics, 29, 1503-1519 fur further details.         Operational Considerations       ==========================         The instrument operated at a much higher temperature than         planned, resulting in a much higher dark current than expected.         Because the clocking of the CCD was synchronized with the         rotation of the spacecraft as projected on the sky, the         effective exposure time varies with the orientation of the         telescope and its periscopic 45-degree mirror with the shortest         effective exposure times occurring at closest approach (viewing         perpendicular to the axis of spin). Because of the periscopic         approach to scanning, the shape of the field of view is a         function of the rotation of the telescope and its 45-degree         periscopic mirror.  Geometric rectification was carried out         after the image was transmitted back to Earth.

Coincidence between the two rows was used to           discriminate against cosmic rays.  Two clocking speeds were           used to allow for different brightness levels of the target.

The CCD is a virtual-phase device by Texas Instruments           with two independent sections of 390 by 292 pixels and the two           windows are at the 'leading' edge of each section.  Pixel size           is 22.35 microns square.  The window in the mask is the full           width of 390 pixels by several pixels and the clocking is           varied to synchronize with the apparent motion of the image           across the detector window.  The output is thus a line of 390           pixels for each of many different positions in the image.

The CCD is a virtual-phase device by Texas Instruments           with two independent sections of 390 by 292 pixels and the two           windows are at the 'leading' edge of each section.  Pixel size           is 22.35 microns square.  The window in the mask is the full           width of 390 pixels by several pixels and the clocking is           varied to synchronize with the apparent motion of the image           across the detector window.  The output is thus a line of 390           pixels for each of many different positions in the image.           This window is always open to white light without a filter and           is the last of the four imaging detectors to 'see' an object           as the field of view of the telescope sweeps across the sky.             Sensitivity Description: See response curve for CCD given in           Schmidt et al.  (1986), Figure 9 and the reflectivity of the           mirror given in Figure 7 of the same reference.  See also the           characteristics of Filter E in the appropriate template or in           Table I of the same reference.         Electronics       ===========         The CCDs are read out using a Correlated Double Sampling         technique to minimize noise and are then digitized with a 12-bit         ADC.  A 4-to-1 gain switch in front of the ADC effectively         provides a 14-bit ADC.  Super-pixels are created in various         formats by binning the charge from multiple pixels on the         charge-sensing node of the output gate of the CCD. Formats for         binning are: SPF-0 = 1 x 1; SPF-1 = 2 x 2; SPF-2 = 4 x 4; SPF-3         = 8 x 8; SPF-4 = 16 x 16; and SPF-5 = 4 x 3.  Noise of 75         electrons (rms) has been achieved in flight but there appears to         have been some interference from other experiments or other         parts of this experiment.  The two CCDs are read out in parallel         in MDM.  The two lines of the reticon are each read out on two         video lines alternately.  There are two readout speeds, a slow         speed using both lines of pixels for acquiring the comet         initially, and a high speed used with a single line of pixels to         evaluate the position of the comet prior to the arrival of that         part of the image at the first CCD detector.  An acquisition         preprocessor converts the reticon signals into the minimum         number of bytes needed to specify the passage of a bright object         across the field of view of the reticon.  A tracking         preprocessor determines the actual location of the bright object         relative to the spacecraft for use in acquisition and in         controlling the clocking of the CCD readout.  A mass memory unit         can store the full readout from all four detectors during a         single spin of the spacecraft.  The digital processing unit uses         an algorithm to select portions of the images for telemetry         since the maximum data rate can not accommodate transmission of         the full images.

Optics       ======         The basic telescope is a modified Ritchey-Chretien with a         correcting field lens at the focal plane. The primary has a         clear aperture of 166 mm.  The primary and secondary are         separated by 246 mm.  The unvignetted field of view has a         diameter of 1.4 located near the entrance pupil of the         telescope.

The 45-degree diagonal mirror at the entrance pupil         of the telescope extends beyond the body of the spacecraft to         enable viewing in all directions.         Instrument Section/Operating Mode Descriptions       ==============================================         Data Rate          : 20058 bit/sec         Sample Bits : 8         FOV Shape : RECTANGULAR         Instrument Parameter Name : PIXEL         Sampling Parameter Name : PIXEL           ACQ Mode         --------           ACQ, or Acquisition Mode, was used prior to encounter to           search a 4.4- by 4.6-degree field centered on the spacecraft's           axis of spin.  The searching is accomplished by a combination           of the spin and tilting the 45-degree, periscopic mirror.  The           reticon was used in a coincidence mode to locate the brightest           object in the field of view.  After a sufficient number of           detections, the instrument's DPU calculated the position of           the comet relative to the spacecraft and predicted the           pointing of the camera for the transmitted to Earth.           Data Path Type: INTERNAL TO INSTRUMENT ONLY           SDM Mode         --------           Single Detector Mode, or Coma Mode, was used for most           observations far from the time of closest approach when the           annular field of view swept out by the detectors had such a           small radius of curvature that the motion of the field could           be orthogonal to only one of the linear detectors. Detector C           was used to locate the center of brightness which was then fed           back, once every second spin of the spacecraft, to the           controlling electronics.  These then adjusted the periscopic           mirror to make the motion orthogonal to detector C and           adjusted the clocking rate of the detector to match the motion           of the field of view.  A sub-mode of this mode, known as           'Photometer Mode', involved stopping the clocking of the CCD           so that it integrated across the entire coma.           MDM Mode         --------           Multi Detector Mode, or Nucleus Mode, was used for imaging           near the time of closest approach (when the radius of the           annular field swept out was greater than 1.6 degrees),           starting roughly 5 minutes before closest approach.  In this           mode, the spacecraft and all four detectors were used.           Data Path Type:                    REAL-TIME TELEMETRY OF SUBSET OF PIXELS           OBS Mode         --------           Observatory Mode was intended for observations of stars during           cruise phase, primarily for calibration of the camera.  The           camera did not track in this mode and fast sequences of           filters were used.

urn:esa:psa:context:instrument:gio.ims,ION MASS SPECTROMETER for GIO,ION MASS SPECTROMETER,"       Instrument Overview       ===================       The ion mass spectrometer consists of two major subsystems.  One       section, the High Energy Range Spectrometer (HERS) was designed to       measure the ion abundances and the 3-dimensional velocity distribution       outside the contact surface, where the ions are hot and there is       considerable turbulence.  The other section, the High Intensity       Spectrometer (HIS) was designed to measure the abundances of the       low-energy ions inside the contact surface, where the ions were       expected to have higher abundances and lower temperatures.  This       section contained separate Mass and Angle Analyzers.  Both sections       of the instrument were powered and controlled from a common power       supply and control unit.         HERS:         HERS utilized a cylindrical, electrostatic mirror to redirect the ions       from the direction of incidence to the entrance slit of the instrument       and also to demagnify the range of accepted directions from 60 degrees       in true elevation (angle with respect to the spacecraft spin vector) to       30 degrees at the entrance slit of the spectrometer.  The 60-degree       field of view in azimuth extends from 15 degrees to 75 degrees relative       to the spin axis of the spacecraft and thus does not include the ram       direction.  The field of view in azimuth (scanned by the rotation of       the spacecraft) is 2 degrees. Cylindrical accelerating/decelerating       grids are located immediately in front of the entrance slit which is       3.60 mm by 1.26 mm.  Behind the slit is a 120-degree sector magnet       followed by a second slit identical to the entrance slit.  The magnet       is of samarium-cobalt with a pole gap of 5 mm and a field strength of       0.335 Tesla (uniform to 0.5%).  The combination of the slits and the       sector magnet provides a filter which selects a constant value of the       normal component of momentum per unit charge of 7560/(M/Q) eV/e.  The       output slit from the sector magnet is followed by an electrostatic       deflector (ESD) which deflects ions out of the optical plane of the       magnet towards the detectors.  Since the ions have already been       selected for momentum per charge by the sector magnet, the sorting       by energy done by the electrostatic deflector is equivalent to sorting       by mass.  The ESD field is non-uniform in such a way that all ions of       a given M/Q are focussed in the detector plane.  The focal line for       ions of different elevation is nearly straight and position along this       line maps out the angle that ion trajectories make at the entrance       slit. The ESD field is generated by applying voltages, via a resistive       divider between two adjustable voltages, to a series of vane-like       electrodes arranged appropriately inside the ESD.  The vane-shaped       electrodes are also arranged so as to trap ions outside the range of       M/Q which is being deflected onto the detector.         The main detector for HERS is a micro-channel plate (MCP) with 50-mm       diameter and curved channels.  The range of energies incident on the       MCP is varied by varying the two voltages applied to the resistive       divider.  As examples, voltages of +4667 and -667 put light ions       (M = 2 - 4) on the MCP.  Voltages of 770 v and -110 v put medium ions       (M = 12 - 26) on the MCP and voltages of 576 v and -82 v put heavy       ions (m = 16 - 35) on the MCP.  A set of 4 discrete Channel Electron       Multipliers (CEMs), each with a 5 x 12.8 mm entrance funnel, is used       to detect protons.  They are placed such that the protons can be       deflected with a weaker field than would be required to image the       protons onto the MCP.  These also allow much higher counting rates       than are allowed by the MCP.         The output of the MCP is analyzed two-dimensionally with two orthogonal       arrays of strip anodes.  An array of 8 strip anodes deposited on the       back surface of the MCP senses the elevation angle of the ion events in       the MCP while an array of 40 strip anodes deposited on a high-purity       alumina plate located 0.1 mm from the output face of the MCP, senses       the mass of the incident ion events.  The mass-anode plate is held at       +50 volts relative to the output of the MCP.  Thus an ion entering the       front of the MCP produces a positive pulse on one of the 8 angle anodes       and a negative pulse on one of the 40 mass anodes.         An event is recorded by the electronics whenever a pulse is produced       at the mass anode which exceeds the threshold, which is selected from a       set of 8 logarithmically spaced values.  An event is classed as good if       there are coincident (within 1 microsecond) pulses at the angle and       mass electrodes.  Events are recorded by the anode numbers on which the       event was detected.  Multiple events within a single time window are       flagged as multiple.  Since the incoming ions are filtered first for       momentum by the sector magnet, the range of energies of ions of a given       mass transiting the instrument is small (roughly +/-3% of the actual       energy).  The instrument is scanned in energy using the accelerator/       decelerator grids in front of the sector magnet.  The remainder of the       instrument optics are floated at the accelerator potential.  The       accelerating potential is swept at 8 Hz through a 4.35 kV triangular       waveform, relative to a selectable central voltage chosen for the range       of masses being measured.  This gives 32 complete energy scans per       4-second rotation of the spacecraft.  Since the sweep is phase-locked       to the spacecraft spin, two sweep phases (separated by 5.6 degrees of       spacecraft rotation) are used alternately to avoid always measuring       the same energy at the same rotational phase.  The mirror voltage is       swept synchronously with the accelerator voltage.         HIS:         This sensor is intended to measure the ions in the inner coma, where       they were expected to be at high densities, low temperatures, and low       bulk velocities with respect to the nucleus.  The mass-range of this       sensor was limited to 12 to 57 amu per charge and the velocities were       to be measured in only a small range around the spacecraft encounter       velocity of 69 km/s, both with respect to speed and with respect to       direction of incidence.         HIS contains both a mass analyzer (MA) and an Angle Analyzer (AA).  The       MA uses both electrostatic and magnetic separation to give good mass       resolution in the vicinity of M/Q = 16 - 20.  The intrinsic field of       view is 2 degrees by 15 degrees, including the direction of the       spacecraft spin axis.  Due to the rotation of the spacecraft, the FOV       sweeps out a cone of half-angle 12 degrees with overlap near the center       of the cone.  The AA is an electrostatic quadrispherical analyzer with       5 miniature CEM detectors at the exit giving a resolution of 5 to 7.5       degrees within a FOV of 2 by 25 degrees.  The cone swept out by this       FOV has a half-angle of 22 degrees. The 2 by 25-degree fan contains       five elevation-angle ranges and the azimuths swept out by the spin of       the spacecraft are sorted into 16 bins. For five major ionic species,       the velocity distribution around the ram direction can be inferred,       thus providing the data necessary to interpret the data from the MA.         The mass analyzer is an excellent analog to a prism spectrograph.       After passing through an entrance slit, the divergent beam of ions is       collimated by a quadrispherical analyzer while filtering out ions of       all values of energy per charge other than the one selected by the       voltages applied to the analyzer.  A permanent magnet (0.19T) disperses       the beam according to the momentum per charge of the particles.  The       entrance slit is then reimaged onto a detector by a second       quadrispherical analyzer, providing a momentum-per-charge spectrum in       the final focal plane.  The instrument is scanned in energy-per-charge       by biasing the entire instrument beyond the first quadrisphere by a       voltage Ub = U1 - Uc where U1 is the central energy per charge       transmitted by the first quadrisphere and Uc is the required energy per       charge for an ion of a given M/Q to hit the desired detector in the       focal plane.  Ub is in the range -1400 to +1050 V.         Discrete, dedicated detectors are mounted in the focal plane at the       correct positions for ion species at 16-21 amu and also at the       positions for the virtual ions at 17.5, 18.5, and 19.5 amu to monitor       interference between channels.  In order to provide sufficient physical       space to fit discrete detectors, the focal plane is imaged onto the       surface of a prism-shaped, activated, lead-glass block.  There are 9       rectangular holes, roughly 0.6 by 2.0 mm, the bottoms of which are       connected to the rear of the block by straight 0.4mm-diameter channels.       The channels are drilled at various angles so that they are well       separated where they emerge from the block.  The funnels of specially       fabricated CEMs are attached to the block at each hole using conductive       epoxy.  The front and back surfaces of the block are gold-plated to       provide conductivity and a voltage of 700 V between the two surfaces       allows the channels in the block to act as preamplifiers for the       discrete CEMs.  This assembly is known as der Igel' after the German       word for the hedgehog which its shape suggests.  The high voltage to       the CEMs can be set to any of four levels between 2.5 and 3.4 kV.         The angle analyzer (AA) bridges the gap between HERS and HIS, providing       a wider field of view than the MA and providing resolution in elevation       so that, in the event that the ions in the inner coma have a       significant temperature or a significant bulk velocity with respect to       the nucleus, the data from the MA can be usefully interpreted.  The       quadrispherical AA plates are similar to those of the first       quadrisphere of the MA and are connected to the same voltage supply.       The collimated beam is incident on aluminum dynodes and the secondary       electrons are collected by a set of 5 CEMs with high voltages       selectable in the range 2.5 to 3.1 kV.  The amplifiers on these CEMs       can handle count rates to 2x10**6 counts per second.         Science Objectives       ==================       The primary scientific objectives of the IMS team were:         1. To measure accurately the relative abundances of both solar and            cometary ions in the cometary coma, and         2. To determine ion velocity distributions as a function of position            within the coma.         Calibration Description       =======================       The entire IMS was calibrated in the ion-beam calibration system at the       University of Bern, using H+, H2+, He+, CH3+, CH4+, Ne+, N2+, Ar+, and       CO2+. Dynamic calibration was performed under the control of the IMS       control unit (IMS-3), with fast, linear sweeps of deflection and       acceleration potentials with the usual encoding of data.  A static       calibration was also performed, under control of a special ground-test       system, which allowed stepping the potentials at discrete values.         The dynamic calibration, which yielded low duty cycles because of the       wide range of energies swept compared to the energy of the incoming       ions, was used primarily to assign the various bins of the sweep       voltage to values of Q/M.         The static calibration was used to investigate the optics and to       optimize voltages.  The static calibration was also used to measure the       response as a function of direction and energy of the incoming ions.       In the static calibration, the energy of the beam was linearly wobbled       over the energy range of the detectors.  The wider of the two angular       dimensions of the field of view was scanned by rotating the turntable       on which IMS was mounted while the narrower dimension was measured by       calibration runs at several discrete settings.         Results of the calibration are described by Balsiger et al. (1986 in       The Giotto Mission, Its Scientific Investigations, ESA SP-1077, p129)       and by Balsiger et al. (1987 J. Phys. E: Sci. Instrum. 20, p753).       Further details of the calibration facility are described by Ghielmetti       et al. (1983 Rev. Sci. Instr. 54, 425).         Operational Considerations       ==========================       IMS functioned as planned during the Giotto encounter with P/Halley.       However, after the encounter, HERS was no longer functional and only       HIS was operational for the encounter with P/Grigg-Skjellerup.  Because       the axis of spacecraft spin was not coincident with the ram direction       during the encounter with P/Grigg-Skjellerup, the range of angles which       were sampled was not symmetric about the ram direction and this must be       taken into account when interpreting those data.           Instrument Mass		: 9.2 kg         Instrument Manufacturer	: UNIVERSITY OF BERN         Platform or Mounting Name   : Spacecraft Body         Electronics       ===========       Electronics ID               : IMS-3         This electronics box contains all the low-voltage electronics,       including an isolating power converter.  It supplies all voltages       needed to drive the various detector amplifiers, the logic, and the       high-voltage power circuitry.  The high-voltage stepping in both       detectors is accomplished with control voltages generated by PROMs       which feed digital-to-analog converters. Two microprocessors, one       each for HIS and HERS, receive and compress digitized data from the       two sensor boxes and also control the modes of the instrument.  The       microprocessor for HERS also controls all general IMS command and       telemetry operations as well as all interactions of IMS with the       spacecraft.         Instrument Section/Operating Mode Descriptions       ==============================================           HERS         ----         This mode is intended for use during cruise and in the outer coma         when the data from HERS are given priority over those from HIS for         telemetry. During each 4-second spin of the spacecraft, 64 complete         energy scans are made for a single range of masses (light, medium,         or heavy), corresponding to 64 separate azimuthal bins, each 5.6         degrees wide.  In successive sweeps, the energy range alternates         between increasing and decreasing such that a given energy can be         sampled at two different relative positions within an azimuthal bin.         A complete cycle consists of 4 spins which are used in one of four         different sub-modes, selected by varying the voltage applied to the         resistive divider for the ESD: 1. protons only for 4 spins.  2.         alternating spins of protons and light ions, 3. no protons - light,         medium, heavy, and medium ions, and 4. all masses - protons, light,         medium, heavy.  Sub-mode 2 is intended for cruise phase to measure         the solar wind and sub-mode 4 is intended for encounter.  Sub-modes         1 and 3 were intended for use if a detector deteriorated.           During cruise phase, and whenever during the encounter phase HERS         is given priority for telemetry, data are transmitted for each spin.         Each ion event is recorded as a 24-bit word containing the anode         numbers for mass and elevation angle, the energy and azimuth bin         numbers, and the direction of the sweep.  For protons, instead of         recording anode numbers, the total counts in each CEM are recorded         for each azimuth and energy bin.  At high count rates, data         compression is used to fit the data into the available telemetry         rate.  In the inner coma, when HIS has priority, each of the mass         ranges is held for two spin periods instead of one and the telemetry         is adjusted accordingly.           FOV Shape Name                 : RECTANGULAR         Horizontal FOV                 : 2.         Vertical FOV                   : 60.             HIS         ---         In the inner coma, when HIS is given priority for telemetry, the         complete cycle is 4 spins of the spacecraft.  The basic program         consists of a 64-step energy scan, repeated 16 times per spin period.         The sets of voltages for deflection, acceleration/deceleration, and         for the quadrispherical lenses, are stored in a PROM in IMS-3.  Per         spin, the total set of 14 CEMs yields 14366 individual count rates.         These are reduced by compression to an array of 1004 8-bit words.         Compression is achieved by i. summing related count rates, ii.         omitting insignificant channels, and iii. quasi-logarithmic         compression of the remaining count rates.  A full cycle can last 1,         2 or 4 spins depending on IMS mode (HIS or HERS priority) and         depending on the actual telemetry rate.           For the AA, only those E/Q channels containing the most abundant ions         (M/Q = 17, 18, 19, 28, 44) are transmitted separately for each of the         16 azimuthal bins in a spin.  The other 59 E/Q channels are         integrated over a full spin and then only CEM 1 (which looks in the         direction of the spin axis) is recorded directly in the telemetry         while the other 4 CEMs are themselves summed before transmission.           The MA has two distinct modes of operation since one can choose the         appropriate acceleration/deceleration voltage and the corresponding         voltage on the quadrisphere to direct any given mass to any given         position on the Igel.  In the N-program, any given mass is always         directed to the same dedicated detector over the appropriate range         of E/Q.  This mode thus allows one to measure velocity distributions         with a single detector and minimize calibration uncertainties.  For         example, in the water-group ions, mass 18 will always be directed at         CEM 4.  The layout of the holes on the faceplate of the Igel was         designed to optimize the detection of species in the water group.         When other mass ranges are directed at the Igel, some masses are not         centered on the detectors.  In the H-program, individual channels in         the Igel are dedicated to specific velocities, centered at the         nominal encounter velocity of 69 km/s.  In this program, all species         at velocity 69 km/s always appear at CEM 6 (and other velocities at         other CEMs).  This program is better suited to determination of         relative abundances.  The choice between N- and H-programs is made         via telemetry, choosing either all N, all H, or alternating N- and         H-programs with a 3:1 or 1:1 ratio over groups of 4 spins.  There is         also the option to wobble the voltage on the external deflector to         move the field of view by 2 degrees for mass 12 (0.5 degrees for mass         57) away from the spacecraft.

The two sensors measure the distribution from 10 eV       ro 20 eV once per spacecraft spin and the distribution from       90 eV to 90 keV, with coars mass discriminations, once every       32 spins.

urn:esa:psa:context:instrument:gio.mag,FLUXGATE MAGNETOMETER for GIO,FLUXGATE MAGNETOMETER,"       Instrument Overview       ===================       The Giotto Magnetometer Experiment consisted of a triaxial and separate       biaxial system of fluxgate sensors of the ring-core type, the       associated analog electronics and a digital processor.  Because of the       dust hazard near closest approach to comet 1P/Halley (the target of the       original Giotto mission), a magnetometer boom could not be included in       the spacecraft design.  The resulting magnetic contamination problem       was addressed by the use of the two magnetometers and by a magnetic       cleanliness program.         For details on the instrument design and operation, see the article       from ESA publication SP-1077 specifically concerning the magnetometer.

urn:esa:psa:context:instrument:gio.ope,OPTICAL PROBE EXPERIMENT for GIO,OPTICAL PROBE EXPERIMENT,"       Instrument Overview       ===================       The instrument is a photometer-polarimeter which views along the spin-       axis of the spacecraft.  Unlike most other instruments on Giotto which       view in the ram direction, OPE views in the anti-ram direction, i.e. in       the direction from which the spacecraft has come.  It thus measures the       integral brightness along the track as a function of position along the       track.  The derivative of this signal is, therefore, the polarized       emissivity at each point of the track.         The instrument has no moving parts.  An f/1.7 objective of 18-mm       diameter images the 'sky' onto a field stop with an effective field of       view of 3 degrees.  The seven interference filters to isolate various       spectral regions are deposited in a mosaic directly on the front       element of the objective and the linearly polarized foil is sandwiched       between the elements of the objective.  Immediately behind the field       stop, a field lens reimages the objective and its mosaic of filters       onto a micro-channel plate.  The micro-channel plate provides anodes       for each of the seven filters.  The mosaic of filters is laid out in       such a way as to provide approximately equal output signals in each       bandpass and to partially correct for aberrations of the optical       system.  Polarization is measured by the rotation of the spacecraft       (which rotates the linearly polarized foil together with the whole       instrument) at 15 RPM.  This allows determination of the first three       Stokes parameters once every 2 seconds (once every half rotation).       The data are sampled every 0.5 seconds, i.e., every 45 degrees of       spacecraft (polaroid) rotation.         The instrument is mounted on the top platform of the Giotto spacecraft,       near the periphery of the spacecraft where it is in the shadow of the       solar panels and can see past the de-spun high-gain antenna.  The       instrument is baffled against stray light from the coma outside the       field of view and against light reflected from the high-gain antenna       or the tripod.  The baffle is 270 mm long with 7 vanes.  A       self-luminescent white source is mounted on the back of the baffle       cover for testing and calibration during the cruise phase.  This       baffle cover was ejected by a pyrotechnic device in October 1985.

Calibration Description       =======================       The pre-flight calibration was carried out primarily at the Max-Planck-       Insitut-fuer-Astronomie in Heidelberg.  The linearity of each of the       seven channels was calibrated by a boot-strap method, starting with two       incident light signals, C1 and C2, of comparable intensity and       comparing the output of the sum of the two signals, C3, with the sum of       the outputs for the two separate signals. The Intensity-Linearity-Ratio       (ILR) for the counting level (C1+C2)/2 is then given by C3/(C1+C2).       The results of a series of measurements on each channel were fitted by       least squares and the resultant curves were used to calibrate the data.         Cross-talk between the channels, which could arise either from optical       scattering within the filters or misalignment of the optics with the       detector or electronic cross-talk, was measured with a beam from a       monochromator having a spectral width of approximately 0.1nm.  The       response of each channel of the instrument was recorded at a variety       of wavelengths.  The results were integrated across each bandpass and       compared with the integrated signal received in the out-of-bandpass       channels.  The out-of-band and in-band counts were corrected by       applying a preliminary ILR derived as a composite of all channels.  The       signals determined in this way were used to determine the preliminary       crosstalk.  This procedure was iterated until it converged.  The final       cross-talk was found to be less than 3%.         A final calibration was obtained on the background sky, zodiacal light       plus diffuse starlight, immediately prior to the encounter.         General steps in going from raw counts to flux include the following:          0. Correct for non-linearity (this correction is completely           negligible for Halley far from the encounter).   It is small for           Halley at closest approach (where signals are strongest) compared           to other uncertainties.        1. Take dark current from same clock-sector reading and multiply by           ratios of areas (obs channel/dark channel) on the MCP and subtract        2. Estimate scattered light, as a function of clock-sector, from the           observations before and after encounter.        3. Correct for cross-talk between channels using matrix in Giovane et           al., 1991.        4. For CO+ channel, multiply by absolute inverse responsivity.        5. For other channels, either add clock sectors separated by 90           degrees or  multiply by two (very approximate), to go from the           polarized intensity to total intensity.         Operational Considerations       ==========================       During the flythrough of Halley's coma, the instrument was pointed in       the direction opposite the direction of motion.  Direct differentiation       of the signal, with a full measurement every two seconds, should       lead to the mean polarized emissivity in a cylinder of length about       137 km (2 seconds of travel) and diameter 6 km (2.62 deg field of       view at a distance of 137 km).  During the entire encounter with       Halley, the scattering angle was 107.2 degrees.         Although the instrument was not damaged during the encounter, the       viewing direction after a dust particle impacted Giotto was not anymore       parallel to the direction of motion, and not well determined, and thus       the data could not be analyzed.         Measurements were performed every 45 degrees in rotational phase.       Only five phases gave a usable signal; these phases can readily be       identified in the data tables by the chronology of the cometocentric       distance: each geometrical configuration repeats itself every 4 sec       or every 274 km along the spacecraft track.         Due to the strength of the underlying continuum signal in the CO+       filter, the weak CO+ emission was not truly detected and that channel       can be considred as another continuum channel.

urn:esa:psa:context:instrument:gio.pia,PARTICULATE IMPACT ANALYZER for GIO,PARTICULATE IMPACT ANALYZER,"       Instrument Overview     ===================       Dust is collected from the ram direction of the       spacecraft (i.e., parallel to the spin axis)       through an adjustable, elliptical aperture which       has a collecting area variable between 5 cm^ and 1       mm^2 in order to limit the rate to < 500 per       second, the maximum with which the instrument can       cope.  The particles, moving with roughly the       encounter speed of 69 km/second, are then incident       on an oblique target, the entrance aperture       projecting to a circle adjustable up to 35 mm       diameter.  Particles moving this fast can cause: -       a crater in the target - partial or complete       destruction of the particle, depending on the speed       - emission of secondary particles - a flash of       light - release of neutrals, electrons, and       positive and negative ions.         The target is a 10-micron thick roll of platinum       foil doped with 5% silver.  The roll is 700mm by       55mm and is unrolled and transported across the       entrance aperture at a rate of 0.6mm/sec whenever       the count- rate of dust particles exceeds a certain       level and can also be unrolled with commands in the       telemetry from Earth.  This transport ensures that       the portion of the target in use is always clean.         Four different detectors are used to sense the       impact of a particle and initiate the collection of       data for a mass spectrum.  Two detectors, although       shielded, are relatively exposed to the outside       environment, while the other two are completely       shielded from the outside environment.  The impact       of a particle onto the detector can cause       measurable pulses on any of these four detectors       but typically does not cause a detected pulse on       all of them. 1.  A photomultiplier (PMT) senses the       light-pulse produced on the impact of a particle       onto the target.  The output of the PMT is fed       through an rms noisemeter which is used to adjust       the triggering threshold automatically.  Although       shielded, ambient light fluctuations can reach the       PMT by scattering.  (Signal PM) 2.  Pulses of       positive ions are sensed as a pulse at the target       itself, which is held at +1kV.  This sensor is also       fed to an rms noise meter which adjusts the       discriminator.  Since the target is exposed to       ambient plasma from the ram direction, it is       sensitive to external fluctuations.  (Signal TG) 3.       Pulses of electrons are collected at the 'catcher       channel', an anode to the side of the main path for       ions.  This detector is well shielded from the       external environment so that pulses here should all       correspond to real events.  (Signal CA) 4.  Pulses       of positive ions are also sensed at the       accelerating grid, held at -2kV, which accelerates       the ions into the mass spectrometer.  This sensor       is also well isolated from the external       environment.  (Signal AC) Because a dynamic range       of at least 4 decades was desired (to detect       particles from 0.1 to 10 microns), the amplifiers       on these front-end channels can be switched between       two gain ranges, each three decades and separated       by a factor 100 (i.e.  gains 1-1000 and 100-100,000       in arbitrary units).  The outputs of the amplifiers       are each monitored by three single-channel       discriminators set at relative levels of 1x, 10x,       and 100x.         The mass spectrometer operates on the       time-of-flight principle, accelerating all ions to       a constant energy, thereby sorting them to       different velocities dependent on the mass.  Since       each particle produces a burst of ions in a very       narrow interval of time, the arrival time of the       ions at the detector is related directly to the       mass of the ions.  The positive ions, after passing       the accelerator grid (-2 kV), are decelerated to an       energy of 1 kV by a grid at the entrance to the       first drift tube.  While passing along this first       drift tube, the ions are focussed by an ion lens to       remove the transverse dispersion in the motions.       The charge induced on the lens by the passage of a       pulse of ions is recorded as an additional monitor       of the existence of a real particle event.  (Signal       MO) The ions then enter a reflector which serves as       a first order energy focussing device to remove the       dispersion due to the initial energies which the       ions have from the formation process (up to about       70 eV).  They then pass along the second drift tube       which contains a second ion lens.         At the end of the second drift tube, the ions are       incident on a multiplier with 20 dynodes.  At this       point, the ions from a single initial particle       impact have been sorted in time by their masses       with ions having masses from 1 to 110 amu arriving       roughly from 4 to 42.5 microseconds, mass being       proportional to the square of the arrival time.       The output of the multiplier is recorded by       converting the signals from dynodes 5, 8, 11, 14,       17, and 20 to a logarithmic scale and then summing       these six signals.  This yields an output signal       with 5 decades of dynamic range.  This signal is       digitized and stored in a memory together with the       digital output of a time^2 signal generator which       provides an index of the mass of the ions.         Instrument Manufacturer	:               Max-Planck-Institut-fuer-Kernphysik          Platform or Mounting Name :Spacecraft body       Science Objectives     ==================       The objective is the in-situ measurement of the       chemical and physical properties of cometary dust       particles.  The chemical compositions and masses of       individual particles will be measured.  Their       impact rate, determined as a function of position       relative to the comet's nucleus, will be used to       establish the mass distribution and production       characteristics of cometary dust.  In particular,       the goals are to: - determine the elemental       abundance of individual particles and to ascertain       whether there are distinct particle classes that       differ from each other chemically - investigate       whether the elemental particle composition depends       on the distance from the nucleus, and to look       specifically for the effects of ice evaporation       from particle surfaces - gain insight into the       molecular composition of the impacting particles,       with emphasis on possible evidence of organic       matter - determine specific isotopic ratios, such       as 6Li/7Li, 10B/11B, 12C/13C, and to try to       establish the origin of the comet's particulate       matter - study the mass distribution function of       impacting particles, derive the total dust       production rate in the measured mass range, and       compare the latter with theoretical models -       determine the extent of the dust envelope as a       function of particle mass and analyze possible       asymmetries in impact rate to model anisotropy       effects in the dust's production.       Calibration Description     =======================       The multiplier is calibrated in flight by an EPID       (Electronic Pulse Induced Desorption) ion       generator.  This provides ions of two masses with a       known intensity ratio.  The mass scale is       calibrated against the value from the t^2 generator       after receipt of the telemetry by identifying       specific lines, typically the two lines due to       silver produced from the target.       Electronics     ===========       The experiment runs entirely autonomously and was       designed to collect data for a period of 4 hours,       with nearly all the events occurring during the 20       minutes centered on the time of closest approach.       The control is implemented with an RCA 1802       microprocessor and several PROMs.  A number of       parameters about the previous measurements are       maintained in order to adjust the operating modes       of the system.  The normal state of the system is       one in which it is waiting for a particle impact to       occur.  If no impact occurs for a second, the       internal parameters are updated.  These parameters       include: i.  the impact rate for all events (rate       IR, number of events per second) ii.  the impact       rate for large events, i.e.  events in which the       100x threshold is exceeded in one of the front-end       channels (rate IRL, number of events per second)       iii.  the impact rate for events with mass spectra,       i.e.  events in which a minimum number of ions are       counted in the mass spectrum (various rates are       stored, IR4 is the rate of events of classes 4       through 7 as defined below) iv.  the onboard time       counter v.  the number of EDFs transmitted per       second.  After updating the parameters, whether       after an event or after the 1-second interval       without an event, the system processes any commands       received, sets the spectrum mode (0 to 3), enables       the trigger channels, sets the number of front-end       coincidences required to trigger an event, adjusts       the sensitivity settings, sets the high voltage on       the multiplier, adjusts the shutter position, and       moves the target if motion is required.         All instrument parameters are preset when the       instrument is turned on.  Values stored in PROM are       used when the instrument is turned on for the first       time on spacecraft power.  When the instrument is       turned off but spacecraft power is still in place,       all instrumental parameters are stored in RAM and       these values are used when the instrument is       reactivated.         Since small particles may not trigger all of the       front-end channels, at low count rates an event is       triggered whenever any single front-end channel is       triggered.  At higher count rates additional       front-end channels must be triggered.  Specifically       whenever IR4 > 10/second and IR > 2*IR4, a       coincidence with an additional front-end channel is       required.  Whenever the triggering rate of a       front-end channel exceeds the rate at which the       instrument can process events, the noise-detection       system on the front-end channel adjusts the       triggering level upwards.  If this level exceeds,       3.2 volts, that channel is disabled.  Normally, the       front-end channel amplifiers are set to the high       sensitivity range.  If all three front-end channels       become disabled due to excessively high count       rates, the amplifiers are automatically set to the       low sensitivity range and reenabled.  All front-end       channels (AC, PM, TG, CA, and MO) are set to the       low sensitivity mode if there are enough events to       fill the telemetry capacity, specifically if IRL >       TMR + 3.         The mode in which spectra are recorded also depends       on the counting rate.  Every 26th event is always       recorded in mode 0.  The mode for the remaining       spectra (1 to 3) is increased by 1 whenever IR4 >=       2*TMR or IR4 > 128.  It is reduced by 1 whenever       IR4 < 2*TMR.  These mode changes are implemented at       4-second intervals, if required.         The shutter aperture is also controlled by the       microprocessor through a stepping motor which takes       71 steps to go from 500 mm^2 to 1 mm^2 with the       default position ('zero' position) at 457 mm^2.       The positions at 500 m^2 and 52.4 mm^2 are sensed       by microswitches.  The control algorithm is based       on the value of IR4 (event rate for classes 4 to       7).         IR4 <  15: open by 9 steps       IR4 <  30: open by 6 steps       IR4 <  60: open by 3 steps       IR4 >  90: close by 3 steps       IR4 > 180: close by 6 steps       IR4 > 254: close by 9 steps         Since only one motor is allowed to be moving at any       given time, the shutter motor has priority over the       target motor.         The target motion is also controlled by the count       rate, unless the shutter is also moving, starting       when IR4 > 60 and stopping when IR4 < 30.  The rate       of motion is fixed at 0.6 mm/s.         Events are classified by the data processing system       as follows: 1.  Events with only 1 front-end signal       2.  Events with a coincidence between 2 front-end       channels 3.  Events that have a coincidence with       all 3 front-end channels but still do not exhibit a       mass spectrum 4.  Events that have a minimum of 52,       46, or 10 entries in the spectrum for modes 1, 2,       and 3, respectively 5.  Events that have a minimum       of 54/48/12 entries in the mass spectrum but not       more than 228/148/140 entries and which also have a       minimum of 26/21/6 entries in the mass range 6-58       amu. 6.  Class 5 events that also have at least 2       entries of at least 0.2 full scale in the range 5-8       amu. 7.  Class 5 events that have a minimum of       34/27/12 entries in the mass window but not more       than 93/49/46 8.  Events from the statistical       sample 9.  test pulses 10.  events from the AHV       routine (calibration) 0.  Events that have already       been transferred to the telemetry system.  When a       new event is classified, the controller searches       first for an empty section of memory in which to       store it.  Failing that, it searches for an event       of lower class to be overwritten.         The high voltage applied to the multiplier controls       the sensitivity and the dynamic range of the mass       spectra.  The value is set by telecommand to one of       128 discrete values between 0 and 4500 V.         Instrument Operating Mode Descriptions     ======================================         Mode 0       ------         15 MHz Mode.  In this mode, the output of the         multiplier is digitized and recorded in the event         memory every 66.66 nanoseconds.  The output of         the t^2 generator is not recorded in this mode.         Mode 1       ------         Max/Min Mode.  At each maximum of the signal         appearing at the MP output, a sample is taken of         the multiplier output and of the t^2 generator.         An additional sample is taken 1/2 mass unit after         each maximum in the multiplier output.  This         should correspond to the minimum between two         adjacent masses.  In addition, an sample is taken         every 1.13 microseconds if no other maximum has         occurred in that interval.         Mode 2       ------         Max/Time Mode.  For each maximum in the MP         output, a sample is taken of the MP output and of         the t^2 generator.  In addition, a sample is         taken every 1.13 microseconds if no other maximum         has occurred in that interval.         Mode 3       ------         Max Mode.  This is the same as mode 2 except that         samples are taken only after 8.6 microseconds.

The physical dimensions of the ACP are 220 x 200 x 206 mm. ACP's primary objectives are to: (1) determine the chemical composition of the photochemical aerosol; (2) ascertain the relative abundances of condensed organics in a column average in the lower stratosphere; and, (3) obtain the relative abundances of condensed organics in a column average in the upper troposphere. ACP, in coordination with other probe instruments, also strives to achieve several secondary objectives. They are to: (1) obtain the absolute abundance for all condensed species, averaged over both the lower stratopsphere and the upper troposphere; (2) determine the mean sizes of aerosol nucleation sites averaged over the lower stratosphere and compare it with those in the upper troposphere; and, (3) detect non-condensable species (e.g., CO) trapped in aerosols. In order to achieve these objectives, the instrument is equipped with a deployable sampling device which will be operated twice during descent in order to collect aerosols.

urn:esa:psa:context:instrument:hp.disr,DESCENT IMAGER SPECTRAL RADIOMETER for HP,DESCENT IMAGER SPECTRAL RADIOMETER,"Sunlight plays a key role in driving many important physical processes in planetary physics. Absorption of UV light drives photochemical reactions, leading to changes in atmospheric composition and the production of atmospheric aerosols. The size, shape, composition and distribution of aerosols and cloud particles determine their optical properties and their ability to absorb sunlight and emit thermal infrared radiation. Thus they play a key role in the atmosphere's thermal balance. The net radiative heating or cooling rate provides the forcing for atmospheric dynamics, which in turn can affect the distribution of aerosol and cloud particles and influence climate. The composition, thermal balance, dynamics and meteorology of the atmosphere also affect (and are affected by) the nature of the surface. Surface images in reflected sunlight, together with near-IR reflection spectra, can reveal the nature of the surface and its interactions with atmospheric processes. Optical measurements of solar radiation made inside a planetary atmosphere can thus reveal a great deal about many important physical processes occurring there. The Descent Imager/Spectral Radiometer (DISR) is the optical instrument aboard Huygens that makes measurements at solar wavelengths. It was developed in a collaborative effort by scientists from the US, France and Germany. DISR measures solar radiation using silicon photodiodes, a 2D silicon Charge Coupled Device (CCD) detector and two InGaAs near-IR linear array detectors. Fibre optics connect the detectors to many separate sets of foreoptics that collect light from different directions and in different spectral regions. In this way, the instrument can collect a suite of measurements that are carefully selected to answer key questions concerning the nature of Titan's surface and the composition, meteorology, thermal balance and clouds and aerosols in Titan's atmosphere.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is anticipated that the measurements so obtained will be so sensitive that, by having the probe transmitting antennae offset from the spin axis by just a few centimeters, it will be possible to determine the spin rate and phase of the probe.

urn:esa:psa:context:instrument:iue.lwp,LONG-WAVELENGTH PRIME for IUE,LONG-WAVELENGTH PRIME,"       NOTE: The INSTRUMENT descriptions for the SWP, LWR, and LWP           spectrographs are included in the following text.       The IUE scientific instrument contains two spectrographs which function     independently. Each spectrograph has a prime and a redundant camera.     The Long-Wavelength Prime (LWP) and Short-Wavelength Prime (SWP)     cameras are the standard detectors (the LWR (Long-Wavelength Redundant)     was used before Oct, 1983). For descriptions see Boggess et     al.(1978a,b) and Coleman et al. (1977).       The Cameras       During an exposure the image is integrated in the SEC Vidicon section     of the camera. There is no exposure meter so the length of the exposure     must be estimated. The duration of the exposure is controlled by the     on-board computer (OBC). The exposure length is quantized in units of     0.4096 seconds and can be modified in real-time. At the conclusion of     the exposure the camera retains the image until a read is initiated. A     read consists of a raster scan of 768 X 768 pixels. The video signal is     digitized into one of 256 discrete levels (0 to 255 Data Numbers, or     DN) by an eight-bit analog-to-digital converter. Since there is no     on-board data recorder, the signal is concurrently transmitted to the     ground station in real-time as the read scan is performed. At the     highest available telemetry rate, 20 kilobits/sec, the transmission of     an entire image and associated engineering data takes 5.24 minutes. The     read is destructive, so if something happens to the quality of the     received signal or to the ground data-handling system during the read,     portions of the image can be permanently lost.       After a  camera has been read, residual images are erased and a     reproducible electronic pedestal of 15 to 40 DN is produced by     exposing the camera to a tungsten flood lamp, reading the camera with     a defocused beam, and then exposing and reading again. This sequence is     called a PREP. Standard and overexposed preps are available. Technical     details are given in the IUE Camera User's Guide (Coleman et al. 1977).       The Spectrograph       With the LWP and SWP cameras,  the spectrographs cover the spectral     ranges given in the Table below. Gaps in wavelength coverage in high     dispersion are caused by truncation of the lower orders by the edge     of the camera faceplate.                              IUE Camera Wavelength Coverage       Camera     (FULL) High Dispersion (PARTIAL)          Low Dispersion         LWP       1845-2980 A      2980-3230 A               1910-3300 A       LWR       1845-2980 A      2980-3230 A               1910-3300 A       SWP       1145-1930 A      1930-2198 A               1150-1975 A       Both the long and short wavelength spectrographs have two entrance     apertures: a small aperture (nominal 3 arcsec diameter circle) and a     large aperture (nominal 10 arcsec by 20 arcsec slot). Although the     various methods available for determining the fundamental dimensions do     not always yield results which agree to within the limits set by the     internal consistency of each (see Panek 1982), the Three Agency     Coordination Meeting adopted recommended values for certain dimensions,     which are presented in the following Table. These values do not reflect     the true physical size of the apertures but rather the size as     projected on the camera faceplate. As a result, each spectrograph has     its own distinct measurement of the aperture sizes.

In     addition, knowledge of the effective aperture area is needed to     calibrate properly spectra of extended objects.         The camera plate scales have been redetermined (Garhart 1996; LWP     1.5644, LWR 1.5526, and SWP 1.5300 arcseconds per pixel) using the most     recent measurements for the small-to-large aperture offsets in pixels     (Table 2.2) and FES aperture center locations in arcseconds (Pitts     1988). These latest incarnations replace the oft-quoted plate scale     figure of 1.525 arcseconds per pixel (Bohlin et al. 1980), a value that     had been used for all three cameras. The aperture separations in the     directions along and perpendicular to the dispersion are given in Table     2.2 for low dispersion. The corresponding values for the     high-dispersion offsets are obtained by transposing the entries for the     low-dispersion offsets along and perpendicular to the dispersion in     Table 2.2. Refer to Figures 2.16 through 2.18 to determine the correct     sign for the high-dispersion offsets (Garhart et al. 1997) .

The total offset is defined as the square root of the sum of     the squares of the individual terms. The offsets along the dispersion     have been incorporated into the geometric correction step such that     the wavelength scales for the small and large apertures are aligned.       The geometry of the two entrance apertures in relation to the image     scan lines and the high and low resolution dispersion directions are     shown in Fig. 2.16-2.18 in the IUE NEWSIPS Manual (Garhart  et     al. 1997). The figures are drawn in the geometrically corrected frame     of reference with the origin at the upper left. Note particularly the     fact that the displacement between the short wavelength large aperture     (SWLA) and the short wavelength small aperture (SWSA) is very nearly     along the echelle dispersion direction. Therefore, short wavelength     high-dispersion images in which both apertures are exposed will result     in nearly complete superposition of the large- and small-aperture     spectra (with a wavelength offset). The displacement of the long     wavelength large aperture (LWLA) and the long wavelength small aperture     (LWSA) is less coincident with the echelle dispersion direction in     those spectrographs, so that superposition of large- and small-aperture     high-dispersion spectra is not as serious in the long wavelength     spectrograph.       For the purposes of judging the extent and separation of the apertures     in the spectral domain, the scales given in the following Table may be     used in conjunction with the quantities given in the above tables. Note     that in high dispersion a given shift along the dispersion corresponds     closely to a constant Doppler velocity shift, whereas in low dispersion     a given shift corresponds to a constant wavelength shift.

While the dominant effect is the camera resolution,     telescope focus and stability of spacecraft pointing also play a major     role in defining the resolution. In addition, it is well known that the     camera resolution is highly wavelength-dependent.       According to the IUE Camera Users Guide (Coleman et al. 1977), the     camera point spread function (PSF) consists of a narrow gaussian-like     core having a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 2 to 5 pixels and a     weak long-range tail. The actual resolution in either the spatial or     spectral direction can be defined as a function of the FWHM. The     Rayleigh criterion of instrumental resolution specifies that two     spectra (spatial direction) or two spectral features (spectral     direction) can be resolved provided their separation is as follows     (Weinstein and Perez 1992):       d >- 0.849 x  FWHM       where d is the distance separating the two features (or spectra). The     gaussian fitting routine used in this analysis was GAUSSFITS, taken     from the IUE Data Analysis Center software library. This procedure     outputs the one-sigma width of the fitted gaussian profile which was     then converted to FWHM using the statistical equality (Bevington 1969):       FWHM = 2.3548 x sigma      --------------------------------------------------------------------------       Resolution Along the Dispersion       A study of the NEWSIPS spectral resolution was performed by measuring     the FWHM of several features for the emission line sources V1016 Cyg,     RR Tel, AG Dra, CI Cyg, and Z And. The analysis indicates a slight     improvement in the NEWSIPS resolution (approximately 10 % or the     SWP and 7 % or the LWR) over the previous results reported by     Cassatella, Barbero, and Benvenuti (1985). Plots of the spectral     resolution data are shown in Figure 2.19 of the NEWSIPS Manual     (Garhart et al. 1997). The small-aperture data are slightly     offset in wavelength from the large-aperture data for clarity.       LWP       - Large-aperture spectral resolution is best between 2700 and 2900 A     with an average FWHM of 5.2 A and decreases to approximately 8.0 A on     either side of this range. Small-aperture resolution is optimal     between 2400 and 3000 A with an average FWHM of 5.5 A and decreases to     8.1 A at the extreme wavelengths.         LWR       - Maximum resolution in the large aperture occurs longward of 2300 A,     with an average FWHM of 5.3 A, while shortward of this point the FWHM     decreases to 7.7 A. Small-aperture resolution is best from 2700-3200 A,     with an average FWHM of 5.4 A, and decreases to 7.7 A at 3350 A and 7.5     A shortward of 2400 A.           SWP       - The best resolution occurs around 1200 A, with a FWHM of 4.6 A in the     large aperture and 3.0 A in the small aperture, and gradually worsens     towards longer wavelengths: 6.7 A at 1900 A in the large aperture and     6.3 A in the small. On average, the small-aperture resolution is     approximately 10% better than the large-aperture resolution.         Resolution Perpendicular to the Dispersion       The NEWSIPS spatial resolution has been determined by analyzing the     spectra of several low-dispersion standard stars (viz., HD 60753,     HD 93521, BD+33 2642, and BD+75 325). The FWHM of large- and small-     aperture spectra were measured at several wavelengths and plotted     (Figure 2.20 in the NEWSIPS Manual Garhart, et al. 1993). As     is the case with the spectral resolution studies, the NEWSIPS values     show, in general, an improvement. As is the case with the spectral     resolution plots, the small-aperture data are slightly offset from the     large-aperture data.       LWP       - The spatial resolution for the LWP is best near 3000 A where the FWHM     for the large aperture is 2.4 pixels (3.6 arcsec), and decreases to     values of around 3.0 pixels at the short and long wavelength ends of     the spectrum. There is no significant difference between the large-     and small-aperture spatial resolutions.       LWR       - The behavior of the LWR camera as a function of wavelength is     similar to the LWP, with the smallest FWHM values for the large     aperture of 2.6 pixels (3.9 arcsec) occurring near 3000 A, and     increasing to 3.6 and 3.0 pixels at the wavelength extremes. The     small aperture, unlike the other two cameras, shows a dramatic     decrease in resolution of approximately 10%.           SWP       - The SWP camera shows the best spatial resolution near 1400 A with     mean FWHM values for the large aperture of 2.7 pixels (4.1 arcsec),     increasing slightly to 2.8 pixels at 1250 A, and 3.7 pixels at 1950 A.     The SWP small-aperture resolution response is approximately the same     as the large-aperture resolution.     ---------------------------------------------------------------------------       * High-Dispersion Mode     o Resolution Along the Dispersion     o Resolution Perpendicular to the Dispersion   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------       Resolution Along the Dispersion       A study of the spectral resolution in the high-dispersion mode was     performed utilizing several methods. The first measured emission lines     from small-aperture wavelength calibration (WAVECAL) images obtained     using the on-board hollow cathode platinum-neon (Pt-Ne) calibration     lamp. The second measured several features from the emission line     sources V1016 Cyg and RR Tel and interstellar absorption line features     from the calibration standard BD+75 325. The third method measured     absorption features from the calibration standard HD 149757 (Zeta Oph).     The WAVECAL images are useful in determining the spectral resolution as     they are not affected by the telescope focus nor are they subject to     astrophysical broadening. The Zeta Oph spectra are characterized by     very narrow interstellar absorption features so they are also useful     for measuring spectral resolution. Therefore, the measurements taken     from WAVECAL and Zeta Oph images represent the best possible spectral     resolution obtainable.         LWP       - The WAVECAL and large-aperture Zeta Oph resolution data are displayed     in Figures 2.21 and 2.24 in the NEWSIPS manual (Nichols-Bohlin et al     1997). The results, along with the associated one-sigma error bars and     linear fits (dashed line), are plotted as a function of order number in     both wavelength and pixel space. The dotted line in the pixel space     plots is the average of the resolution data over all orders. No small-     aperture high-dispersion data of Zeta Oph is available. In addition,     the standard star, RR Tel, and V1016 Cyg data were too noisy to yield     suitable results. The large-aperture Zeta Oph measurements are quite     similar to the small-aperture WAVECAL analysis. The spectral resolution     in wavelength space is approximately 0.18 A FWHM at order 75 and     linearly decreases (roughly) to 0.11 A at order 117. The pixel space     data for both WAVECALs and Zeta Oph show the same improvement in     resolution between orders 95 and 110.       The IUE Systems Design Report (GSFC 1976) lists 15,000 ([lambda/Delta     lambda]) as the high-dispersion resolution for the long-wavelength     cameras. This yields 0.22 A for order 69, 0.17 A for order 90, and 0.13     A for order 123. These numbers are comparable to the NEWSIPS results of     0.24 A, 0.15 A, and 0.12 A for these same orders. An analysis of     IUESIPS spectral resolution was performed by Evans and Imhoff (1985)     using FWHM measurements obtained from WAVECAL images. The results are     as follows: 0.22 A for order 75, 0.17 A for order 83, 0.13 A for order     96, and 0.13 A for order 116. These figures are very similar to the     NEWSIPS results of 0.20 A, 0.14 A, 0.15 A, and 0.13 A.       LWR       - The WAVECAL spectral resolution measurements are shown in Figure 2.22     in the NEWSIPS manual (Nichols-Bohlin et al. 1997) along with the     corresponding linear fit and average. The FWHM trends (wavelength     space) below order 80 are quite similar to the LWP figures (i.e., a     linear dependence of FWHM on order number). The camera resolution in     wavelength space is nearly constant for orders 80 through 115, with a     slight degradation in LWR resolution above order 115. This trend is     easily visible in the the pixel space resolution plot and is evident     from the deviation of the FWHM measurements from the mean (dotted     line).       Cassatella et al. (1981) and Cassatella and Martin (1982) report a     nearly constant FWHM (wavelength space) as a function of order number     for WAVECAL images processed through IUESIPS. The average FWHM from     their analysis is approximately 0.18 A above order 81; a value which     is higher than the corresponding NEWSIPS FWHM of 0.14 A. They report     a FWHM of 0.22 A for order 72, which again is much higher than the     NEWSIPS results of 0.19 A. Evans and Imhoff (1985) also measured     spectral resolution using IUESIPS processed WAVECAL images. They     present FWHM values of 0.19 A, 0.17 A, 0.16 A, and 0.15 A for orders     75, 83, 96, and 116, respectively. The corresponding NEWSIPS values     for these same orders are: 0.19 A, 0.14 A, 0.15 A, and 0.14 A. Boggess     et al. (1978) quote a constant FWHM of 0.19 A for WAVECAL images,     regardless of order number. This contradicts all subsequent reports     written on this subject as well as the NEWSIPS results shown here.     Their analysis was performed early in the life of IUE; perhaps the     camera characteristics had not yet stabilized at this period in time.       SWP       - The WAVECAL, Zeta Oph, and large- and small-aperture stellar source     spectral resolution data are displayed in Figures 2.23, 2.25, 2.26, and     2.27 in the NEWSIPS manual (Nichols-Bohlin et al. 1997). As for LWP and     LWR, the plots include one-sigma error bars and linear (dashed line)     and mean (dotted line) fits to the data. In Figures 2.26 and 2.27, the     emission line measurements for orders 111 and above were excluded from     the analysis when performing the linear fit to the stellar data because     they were highly discrepant. The spectral resolution in wavelength     space for the WAVECAL, Zeta Oph, and stellar source images shows no     dependence on wavelength within an order and a roughly linear     dependence on order number. Unlike the LWP, the SWP resolution from the     Zeta Oph analysis (Figure 2.25) is much worse than the corresponding     WAVECAL data (Figure 2.23). The stellar source results are somewhat     inconclusive for orders 111 and above. The emission line widths are     dramatically higher than the corresponding absorption line     measurements. This trend was also seen in the analysis by Grady (1985).     The IUE Systems Design Report (GSFC 1976) quotes a figure of 10,000     ([lambda/Delta lambda]) for the spectral resolution in high-dispersion     mode. This corresponds to a FWHM of approximately 0.2 A for order 66     and 0.1 A for order 125. This same trend is seen in the top plot     (Figure 2.23) of the WAVECAL resolution analysis; the spectral     resolution is essentially a constant value in pixel space (bottom     plot). The stellar source resolution measurements in pixel space     (bottom plot of Figures 2.26 and 2.27) show some degradation towards     higher order numbers. In addition, the small-aperture data (Figure     2.27) indicates an 8% improvement in resolution over the large-aperture     counterpart (Figure 2.26).       The general trend of the wavelength-space resolution for the WAVECAL     images is approximately the same for every IUESIPS study that has been     reviewed (i.e., Boggess et al. 1978, Cassatella et al. 1981, Cassatella     and Martin 1982, and Evans and Imhoff 1985). That is, the camera     resolution in wavelength space varies roughly linearly with order     number and improves towards shorter wavelengths (0.19 A for order 69     and 0.09 for order 106). The results from analysis of WAVECAL images     processed through NEWSIPS are almost identical to these figures.     Penston (1979) reported SWP large-aperture FWHM values of 0.20 A for     absorption lines and 0.24 A for emission lines. These figures are     comparable with the average NEWSIPS results of 0.21 A and 0.23 A     respectively. However, Penston's (1979) measurements for the small-     aperture resolution are no better than the large aperture. This result     could be supported by the NEWSIPS analysis as the apparent improvement     in small-aperture resolution is less than the one-sigma error of the     FWHM average for any given order. Grady (1985) assessed the effects of     the two-gyro control mode on high-dispersion data using large-aperture     RR Tel spectra. The mean resolution (averaged over all orders) from the     Grady analysis (0.22 A) agrees with the average NEWSIPS resolution     result.           Resolution Perpendicular to the Dispersion       The spatial resolution has been determined by analyzing the spectra of     high-dispersion standard stars. The FWHM of several pairs of large and     small-aperture line-by-line images were measured at five sample     positions (viz., 134, 258, 384, 507, and 615). For each sample     position, a three pixel wide average cross-cut perpendicular to the     dispersion was taken and the widths of the orders measured using the     gaussian fitting routine. The results for each image were in good     agreement, so we averaged the results to yield a set of spectral widths     for each aperture as a function of order number and sample position.     The differences in telescope focus between the images were kept small     so as to minimize the effect of focus on the resolution measurements     (Perez et al. 1990). The database of spectra used for each camera     contains a combination of optimally exposed images for the central     orders and overexposed (in the central orders only) images for the     extreme orders. The spatial resolution data and the one-sigma error     bars for each sample position are plotted as a function of order     number. The small-aperture data are horizontally offset to the left of     the large-aperture data by half an order for clarity. A seventh-order     polynomial fit to the data is also provided.       LWP       - Spatial resolution measurements of the FWHM are plotted in Figures     2.28-2.32 in the NEWSIPS manual (Nichols-Bohlin et al. 1997). The     spatial resolution for sample position 384 is approximately 3.5 pixels     FWHM at order 69 and decreases to 2.3 pixels at order 80 where it is     roughly constant for the remaining orders. The spatial resolution     degrades as one moves towards smaller sample positions and improves     slightly (as compared with sample position 384) above order 90 for     sample position 507. Small- aperture resolution shows an average     improvement (over all orders and sample positions) of 4.6% over the     large aperture. This difference is most apparent between orders 80     through 100 and at the smaller sample positions where it is as much as     8% for sample position 134. Unfortunately, no LWP high-dispersion     spatial resolution studies could be found for IUESIPS data to compare     against the NEWSIPS results.       LWR       - Figures 2.33-2.37 in the NEWSIPS manual (Nichols-Bohlin et al. 1997)     show spatial resolution  of the FWHM plotted as a function of order     number. The resolution trends for sample positions 134 through 384 are     quite similar. The FWHM is approximately 3.0 pixels for order 69 and     linearly decreases to 2.4 pixels at order 80 where it remains fairly     constant for the remaining orders. For sample position 507, the FWHM is     around 3.2 pixels for order 69 and linearly decreases to 2.6 pixels at     order 80 where it then gradually decreases to 2.3 pixels at order 123.     The behavior for sample position 615 demonstrates a rapid decrease in     FWHM from 3.8 pixels at order 69 to 2.7 pixels at order 95 where it     then gradually decreases to 2.3 pixels at order 120. The small-aperture     resolution shows an improvement of approximately 4.7% over the large     aperture.       The IUESIPS FWHM measurements obtained by Cassatella et al. (1981)     using WAVECAL images are somewhat inconclusive. Their data only     includes 5 orders (71, 73, 77, 81, and 90) and no mention was made of     the sample positions at which these measurements were taken. Their     numbers range from 3.5 pixels at order 71 to 2.7 pixels at order 90;     values which are around 10% higher than the corresponding NEWSIPS FWHM     measurements. The trends seen in the 2-D contour plots made by de Boer     et al. (1983) are in good agreement with the NEWSIPS results. They show     that for the central sample positions (i.e., 384) the FWHM starts out     at 3.1 pixels at low order numbers and decreases to 2.8 pixels towards     the center of the camera (e.g., order 90). The slight degradation in     resolution seen in the central orders of Figure 2.35 is also apparent     in the de Boer plots.       SWP       - Spatial resolution measurements of the FWHM are plotted in Figures     2.38-2.42 in the NEWSIPS manual (Nichols-Bohlin et al. 1997). The     resolution trends, by order number, are, in general, the same for every     sample position. The FWHM is around 4 pixels at order 66 (long     wavelengths) and decreases to approximately 2 pixels near order 100     (short wavelengths). Unlike the indications from previous IUESIPS     studies (e.g., Bianchi (1980), Schiffer (1980), and Cassatella et al.     (1981)), this decrease is not linear with order number. A plateau of     around 3.0 pixels FWHM occurs between orders 75 and 85. This trend is     confirmed by the analysis of de Boer et al. (1983), which displayed the     order widths using 2-D contour plots. The FWHM remains fairly constant     above order 100 for sample positions 258 and 384. At these sample     positions, the higher orders (100 and above) are well away from the     edge of the camera. The more extreme sample positions (i.e., 134 and     507) show an edge effect as the resolution dramatically worsens above     order 100. The best spatial resolution occurs near sample position 384     and worsens slightly as one moves towards smaller sample positions     (i.e. shorter wavelengths within an order). Differences in resolution     between the large and small apertures are small. The small aperture     shows an average improvement (over all orders) of 2.4% in resolution     over the large aperture.       As is the case with the low-dispersion resolution studies, the NEWSIPS     values show an improvement over IUESIPS measurements. Schiffer (1980)     quoted FWHM values of 3.5 pixels for order 75 and 2.4 pixels for order     105. The NEWSIPS results for those orders are 3.3 pixels and 2.1     pixels, respectively. Analysis by de Boer et al. (1983) showed the best     resolution of 2.4 pixels FWHM occurring near the center of the camera.     The NEWSIPS results indicate a FWHM of 2.0 pixels in this same area     (sample position 384). Also, Bianchi (1980) expressed FWHM as a     function of order number, regardless of camera, according to the     following formula:       FWHM = 7.23 - 0.04 X m where m is order number and the FWHM is       in pixels. Thus, for order 71, this indicates a FWHM of 4.4 pixels, a     figure that is almost 20% higher than the NEWSIPS average measurement     for that order.

urn:esa:psa:context:instrument:iue.lwr,LONG-WAVELENGTH REDUNDANT for IUE,LONG-WAVELENGTH REDUNDANT,"   NOTE: The INSTRUMENT descriptions for the SWP, LWR, and LWP spectrographs         are included in the following text.   The IUE scientific instrument contains two spectrographs which function independently. Each spectrograph has a prime and a redundant camera. The Long-Wavelength Prime (LWP) and Short-Wavelength Prime (SWP) cameras are the standard detectors (the LWR (Long-Wavelength Redundant) was used before Oct, 1983). For descriptions see Boggess et al.(1978a,b) and Coleman et al. (1977).   The Cameras   During an exposure the image is integrated in the SEC Vidicon section of the camera. There is no exposure meter so the length of the exposure must be estimated. The duration of the exposure is controlled by the on-board computer (OBC). The exposure length is quantized in units of 0.4096 seconds and can be modified in real-time. At the conclusion of the exposure the camera retains the image until a read is initiated. A read consists of a raster scan of 768 X 768 pixels. The video signal is digitized into one of 256 discrete levels (0 to 255 Data Numbers, or DN) by an eight-bit analog-to-digital converter. Since there is no on-board data recorder, the signal is concurrently transmitted to the ground station in real-time as the read scan is performed. At the highest available telemetry rate, 20 kilobits/sec, the transmission of an entire image and associated engineering data takes 5.24 minutes. The read is destructive, so if something happens to the quality of the received signal or to the ground data-handling system during the read, portions of the image can be permanently lost.   After a  camera has been read, residual images are erased and a reproducible electronic pedestal of 15 to 40 DN is produced by exposing the camera to a tungsten flood lamp, reading the camera with a defocused beam, and then exposing and reading again. This sequence is called a PREP. Standard and overexposed preps are available. Technical details are given in the IUE Camera User's Guide (Coleman et al. 1977).   The Spectrograph   With the LWP and SWP cameras,  the spectrographs cover the spectral ranges given in the Table below. Gaps in wavelength coverage in high dispersion are caused by truncation of the lower orders by the edge of the camera faceplate.

Although the various methods available for determining the fundamental dimensions do not always yield results which agree to within the limits set by the internal consistency of each (see Panek 1982), the Three Agency Coordination Meeting adopted recommended values for certain dimensions, which are presented in the following Table. These values do not reflect the true physical size of the apertures but rather the size as projected on the camera faceplate. As a result, each spectrograph has its own distinct measurement of the aperture sizes.

In addition, knowledge of the effective aperture area is needed to calibrate properly spectra of extended objects.     The camera plate scales have been redetermined (Garhart 1996; LWP 1.5644, LWR 1.5526, and SWP 1.5300 arcseconds per pixel) using the most recent measurements for the small-to-large aperture offsets in pixels (Table 2.2) and FES aperture center locations in arcseconds (Pitts 1988). These latest incarnations replace the oft-quoted plate scale figure of 1.525 arcseconds per pixel (Bohlin et al. 1980), a value that had been used for all three cameras. The aperture separations in the directions along and perpendicular to the dispersion are given in Table 2.2 for low dispersion. The corresponding values for the high-dispersion offsets are obtained by transposing the entries for the low-dispersion offsets along and perpendicular to the dispersion in Table 2.2. Refer to Figures 2.16 through 2.18 to determine the correct sign for the high- dispersion offsets (Garhart et al. 1997) .

The total offset is defined as the square root of the sum of the squares of the individual terms. The offsets along the dispersion have been incorporated into the geometric correction step such that the wavelength scales for the small and large apertures are aligned.   The geometry of the two entrance apertures in relation to the image scan lines and the high and low resolution dispersion directions are shown in Fig. 2.16-2.18 in the IUE NEWSIPS Manual (Garhart  et al. 1997). The figures are drawn in the geometrically corrected frame of reference with the origin at the upper left. Note particularly the fact that the displacement between the short wavelength large aperture (SWLA) and the short wavelength small aperture (SWSA) is very nearly along the echelle dispersion direction. Therefore, short wavelength high-dispersion images in which both apertures are exposed will result in nearly complete superposition of the large- and small-aperture spectra (with a wavelength offset). The displacement of the long wavelength large aperture (LWLA) and the long wavelength small aperture (LWSA) is less coincident with the echelle dispersion direction in those spectrographs, so that superposition of large- and small-aperture high-dispersion spectra is not as serious in the long wavelength spectrograph.   For the purposes of judging the extent and separation of the apertures in the spectral domain, the scales given in the following Table may be used in conjunction with the quantities given in the above tables. Note that in high dispersion a given shift along the dispersion corresponds closely to a constant Doppler velocity shift, whereas in low dispersion a given shift corresponds to a constant wavelength shift.

While the dominant effect is the camera resolution, telescope focus and stability of spacecraft pointing also play a major role in defining the resolution. In addition, it is well known that the camera resolution is highly wavelength-dependent.   According to the IUE Camera Users Guide (Coleman et al. 1977), the camera point spread function (PSF) consists of a narrow gaussian-like core having a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 2 to 5 pixels and a weak long-range tail. The actual resolution in either the spatial or spectral direction can be defined as a function of the FWHM. The Rayleigh criterion of instrumental resolution specifies that two spectra (spatial direction) or two spectral features (spectral direction) can be resolved provided their separation is as follows (Weinstein and Perez 1992):   d >- 0.849 x  FWHM   where d is the distance separating the two features (or spectra). The gaussian fitting routine used in this analysis was GAUSSFITS, taken from the IUE Data Analysis Center software library. This procedure outputs the one-sigma width of the fitted gaussian profile which was then converted to FWHM using the statistical equality (Bevington 1969):   FWHM = 2.3548 x sigma     ------------------------------------------------------------------------   Resolution Along the Dispersion   A study of the NEWSIPS spectral resolution was performed by measuring the FWHM of several features for the emission line sources V1016 Cyg, RR Tel, AG Dra, CI Cyg, and Z And. The analysis indicates a slight improvement in the NEWSIPS resolution (approximately 10 % or the SWP and 7 % or the LWR) over the previous results reported by Cassatella, Barbero, and Benvenuti (1985). Plots of the spectral resolution data are shown in Figure 2.19 of the NEWSIPS Manual (Garhart et al. 1997). The small-aperture data are slightly offset in wavelength from the large-aperture data for clarity.   LWP   - Large-aperture spectral resolution is best between 2700 and 2900 A with an average FWHM of 5.2 A and decreases to approximately 8.0 A on either side of this range. Small-aperture resolution is optimal between 2400 and 3000 A with an average FWHM of 5.5 A and decreases to 8.1 A at the extreme wavelengths.     LWR   - Maximum resolution in the large aperture occurs longward of 2300 A, with an average FWHM of 5.3 A, while shortward of this point the FWHM decreases to 7.7 A. Small-aperture resolution is best from 2700-3200 A, with an average FWHM of 5.4 A, and decreases to 7.7 A at 3350 A and 7.5 A shortward of 2400 A.       SWP   - The best resolution occurs around 1200 A, with a FWHM of 4.6 A in the large aperture and 3.0 A in the small aperture, and gradually worsens towards longer wavelengths: 6.7 A at 1900 A in the large aperture and 6.3 A in the small. On average, the small-aperture resolution is approximately 10% better than the large-aperture resolution.     Resolution Perpendicular to the Dispersion   The NEWSIPS spatial resolution has been determined by analyzing the spectra of several low-dispersion standard stars (viz., HD 60753, HD 93521, BD+33 2642, and BD+75 325). The FWHM of large- and small- aperture spectra were measured at several wavelengths and plotted (Figure 2.20 in the NEWSIPS Manual Garhart, et al. 1993). As is the case with the spectral resolution studies, the NEWSIPS values show, in general, an improvement. As is the case with the spectral resolution plots, the small-aperture data are slightly offset from the large-aperture data.   LWP   - The spatial resolution for the LWP is best near 3000 A where the FWHM for the large aperture is 2.4 pixels (3.6 arcsec), and decreases to values of around 3.0 pixels at the short and long wavelength ends of the spectrum. There is no significant difference between the large- and small-aperture spatial resolutions.   LWR   - The behavior of the LWR camera as a function of wavelength is similar to the LWP, with the smallest FWHM values for the large aperture of 2.6 pixels (3.9 arcsec) occurring near 3000 A, and increasing to 3.6 and 3.0 pixels at the wavelength extremes. The small aperture, unlike the other two cameras, shows a dramatic decrease in resolution of approximately 10%.       SWP   - The SWP camera shows thebest spatial resolution near 1400 A with mean FWHM values for the large aperture of 2.7 pixels (4.1 arcsec), increasing slightly to 2.8 pixels at 1250 A, and 3.7 pixels at 1950 A. The SWP small-aperture resolution response is approximately the same as the large-aperture resolution.     --------------------------------------------------------------------------   * High-Dispersion Mode o Resolution Along the Dispersion o Resolution Perpendicular to the Dispersion   --------------------------------------------------------------------------   Resolution Along the Dispersion   A study of the spectral resolution in the high-dispersion mode was performed utilizing several methods. The first measured emission lines from small-aperture wavelength calibration (WAVECAL) images obtained using the on-board hollow cathode platinum-neon (Pt-Ne) calibration lamp. The second measured several features from the emission line sources V1016 Cyg and RR Tel and interstellar absorption line features from the calibration standard BD+75 325. The third method measured absorption features from the calibration standard HD 149757 (Zeta Oph). The WAVECAL images are useful in determining the spectral resolution as they are not affected by the telescope focus nor are they subject to astrophysical broadening. The Zeta Oph spectra are characterized by very narrow interstellar absorption features so they are also useful for measuring spectral resolution. Therefore, the measurements taken from WAVECAL and Zeta Oph images represent the best possible spectral resolution obtainable.     LWP   - The WAVECAL and large-aperture Zeta Oph resolution data are displayed in Figures 2.21 and 2.24 in the NEWSIPS manual (Nichols-Bohlin et al 1997). The results, along with the associated one-sigma error bars and linear fits (dashed line), are plotted as a function of order number in both wavelength and pixel space. The dotted line in the pixel space plots is the average of the resolution data over all orders. No small- aperture high-dispersion data of Zeta Oph is available. In addition, the standard star, RR Tel, and V1016 Cyg data were too noisy to yield suitable results. The large-aperture Zeta Oph measurements are quite similar to the small-aperture WAVECAL analysis. The spectral resolution in wavelength space is approximately 0.18 A FWHM at order 75 and linearly decreases (roughly) to 0.11 A at order 117. The pixel space data for both WAVECALs and Zeta Oph show the same improvement in resolution between orders 95 and 110.   The IUE Systems Design Report (GSFC 1976) lists 15,000 ([lambda/Delta lambda]) as the high-dispersion resolution for the long-wavelength cameras. This yields 0.22 A for order 69, 0.17 A for order 90, and 0.13 A for order 123. These numbers are comparable to the NEWSIPS results of 0.24 A, 0.15 A, and 0.12 A for these same orders. An analysis of IUESIPS spectral resolution was performed by Evans and Imhoff (1985) using FWHM measurements obtained from WAVECAL images. The results are as follows: 0.22 A for order 75, 0.17 A for order 83, 0.13 A for order 96, and 0.13 A for order 116. These figures are very similar to the NEWSIPS results of 0.20 A, 0.14 A, 0.15 A, and 0.13 A.   LWR   - The WAVECAL spectral resolution measurements are shown in Figure 2.22 in the NEWSIPS manual (Nichols-Bohlin et al. 1997) along with the corresponding linear fit and average. The FWHM trends (wavelength space) below order 80 are quite similar to the LWP figures (i.e., a linear dependence of FWHM on order number). The camera resolution in wavelength space is nearly constant for orders 80 through 115, with a slight degradation in LWR resolution above order 115. This trend is easily visible in the the pixel space resolution plot and is evident from the deviation of the FWHM measurements from the mean (dotted line).   Cassatella et al. (1981) and Cassatella and Martin (1982) report a nearly constant FWHM (wavelength space) as a function of order number for WAVECAL images processed through IUESIPS. The average FWHM from their analysis is approximately 0.18 A above order 81; a value which is higher than the corresponding NEWSIPS FWHM of 0.14 A. They report a FWHM of 0.22 A for order 72, which again is much higher than the NEWSIPS results of 0.19 A. Evans and Imhoff (1985) also measured spectral resolution using IUESIPS processed WAVECAL images. They present FWHM values of 0.19 A, 0.17 A, 0.16 A, and 0.15 A for orders 75, 83, 96, and 116, respectively. The corresponding NEWSIPS values for these same orders are: 0.19 A, 0.14 A, 0.15 A, and 0.14 A. Boggess et al. (1978) quote a constant FWHM of 0.19 A for WAVECAL images, regardless of order number. This contradicts all subsequent reports written on this subject as well as the NEWSIPS results shown here. Their analysis was performed early in the life of IUE; perhaps the camera characteristics had not yet stabilized at this period in time.   SWP   - The WAVECAL, Zeta Oph, and large- and small-aperture stellar source spectral resolution data are displayed in Figures 2.23, 2.25, 2.26, and 2.27 in the NEWSIPS manual (Nichols-Bohlin et al. 1997). As for LWP and LWR, the plots include one-sigma error bars and linear (dashed line) and mean (dotted line) fits to the data. In Figures 2.26 and 2.27, the emission line measurements for orders 111 and above were excluded from the analysis when performing the linear fit to the stellar data because they were highly discrepant. The spectral resolution in wavelength space for the WAVECAL, Zeta Oph, and stellar source images shows no dependence on wavelength within an order and a roughly linear dependence on order number. Unlike the LWP, the SWP resolution from the Zeta Oph analysis (Figure 2.25) is much worse than the corresponding WAVECAL data (Figure 2.23). The stellar source results are somewhat inconclusive for orders 111 and above. The emission line widths are dramatically higher than the corresponding absorption line measurements. This trend was also seen in the analysis by Grady (1985). The IUE Systems Design Report (GSFC 1976) quotes a figure of 10,000 ([lambda/Delta lambda]) for the spectral resolution in high-dispersion mode. This corresponds to a FWHM of approximately 0.2 A for order 66 and 0.1 A for order 125. This same trend is seen in the top plot (Figure 2.23) of the WAVECAL resolution analysis; the spectral resolution is essentially a constant value in pixel space (bottom plot). The stellar source resolution measurements in pixel space (bottom plot of Figures 2.26 and 2.27) show some degradation towards higher order numbers. In addition, the small-aperture data (Figure 2.27) indicates an 8% improvement in resolution over the large-aperture counterpart (Figure 2.26).   The general trend of the wavelength-space resolution for the WAVECAL images is approximately the same for every IUESIPS study that has been reviewed (i.e., Boggess et al. 1978, Cassatella et al. 1981, Cassatella and Martin 1982, and Evans and Imhoff 1985). That is, the camera resolution in wavelength space varies roughly linearly with order number and improves towards shorter wavelengths (0.19 A for order 69 and 0.09 for order 106). The results from analysis of WAVECAL images processed through NEWSIPS are almost identical to these figures. Penston (1979) reported SWP large-aperture FWHM values of 0.20 A for absorption lines and 0.24 A for emission lines. These figures are comparable with the average NEWSIPS results of 0.21 A and 0.23 A respectively. However, Penston's (1979) measurements for the small-aperture resolution are no better than the large aperture. This result could be supported by the NEWSIPS analysis as the apparent improvement in small-aperture resolution is less than the one-sigma error of the FWHM average for any given order. Grady (1985) assessed the effects of the two-gyro control mode on high-dispersion data using large-aperture RR Tel spectra. The mean resolution (averaged over all orders) from the Grady analysis (0.22 A) agrees with the average NEWSIPS resolution result.       Resolution Perpendicular to the Dispersion   The spatial resolution has been determined by analyzing the spectra of high-dispersion standard stars. The FWHM of several pairs of large and small-aperture line-by-line images were measured at five sample positions (viz., 134, 258, 384, 507, and 615). For each sample position, a three pixel wide average cross-cut perpendicular to the dispersion was taken and the widths of the orders measured using the gaussian fitting routine. The results for each image were in good agreement, so we averaged the results to yield a set of spectral widths for each aperture as a function of order number and sample position. The differences in telescope focus between the images were kept small so as to minimize the effect of focus on the resolution measurements (Perez et al. 1990). The database of spectra used for each camera contains a combination of optimally exposed images for the central orders and overexposed (in the central orders only) images for the extreme orders. The spatial resolution data and the one-sigma error bars for each sample position are plotted as a function of order number. The small-aperture data are horizontally offset to the left of the large-aperture data by half an order for clarity. A seventh-order polynomial fit to the data is also provided.   LWP   - Spatial resolution measurements of the FWHM are plotted in Figures 2.28-2.32 in the NEWSIPS manual (Nichols-Bohlin et al. 1997). The spatial resolution for sample position 384 is approximately 3.5 pixels FWHM at order 69 and decreases to 2.3 pixels at order 80 where it is roughly constant for the remaining orders. The spatial resolution degrades as one moves towards smaller sample positions and improves slightly (as compared with sample position 384) above order 90 for sample position 507. Small- aperture resolution shows an average improvement (over all orders and sample positions) of 4.6% over the large aperture. This difference is most apparent between orders 80 through 100 and at the smaller sample positions where it is as much as 8% for sample position 134. Unfortunately, no LWP high-dispersion spatial resolution studies could be found for IUESIPS data to compare against the NEWSIPS results.   LWR   - Figures 2.33-2.37 in the NEWSIPS manual (Nichols-Bohlin et al. 1997) show spatial resolution  of the FWHM plotted as a function of order number. The resolution trends for sample positions 134 through 384 are quite similar. The FWHM is approximately 3.0 pixels for order 69 and linearly decreases to 2.4 pixels at order 80 where it remains fairly constant for the remaining orders. For sample position 507, the FWHM is around 3.2 pixels for order 69 and linearly decreases to 2.6 pixels at order 80 where it then gradually decreases to 2.3 pixels at order 123. The behavior for sample position 615 demonstrates a rapid decrease in FWHM from 3.8 pixels at order 69 to 2.7 pixels at order 95 where it then gradually decreases to 2.3 pixels at order 120. The small-aperture resolution shows an improvement of approximately 4.7% over the large aperture.   The IUESIPS FWHM measurements obtained by Cassatella et al. (1981) using WAVECAL images are somewhat inconclusive. Their data only includes 5 orders (71, 73, 77, 81, and 90) and no mention was made of the sample positions at which these measurements were taken. Their numbers range from 3.5 pixels at order 71 to 2.7 pixels at order 90; values which are around 10% higher than the corresponding NEWSIPS FWHM measurements. The trends seen in the 2-D contour plots made by de Boer et al. (1983) are in good agreement with the NEWSIPS results. They show that for the central sample positions (i.e., 384) the FWHM starts out at 3.1 pixels at low order numbers and decreases to 2.8 pixels towards the center of the camera (e.g., order 90). The slight degradation in resolution seen in the central orders of Figure 2.35 is also apparent in the de Boer plots.   SWP   - Spatial resolution measurements of the FWHM are plotted in Figures 2.38-2.42 in the NEWSIPS manual (Nichols-Bohlin et al. 1997). The resolution trends, by order number, are, in general, the same for every sample position. The FWHM is around 4 pixels at order 66 (long wavelengths) and decreases to approximately 2 pixels near order 100 (short wavelengths). Unlike the indications from previous IUESIPS studies (e.g., Bianchi (1980), Schiffer (1980), and Cassatella et al. (1981)), this decrease is not linear with order number. A plateau of around 3.0 pixels FWHM occurs between orders 75 and 85. This trend is confirmed by the analysis of de Boer et al. (1983), which displayed the order widths using 2-D contour plots. The FWHM remains fairly constant above order 100 for sample positions 258 and 384. At these sample positions, the higher orders (100 and above) are well away from the edge of the camera. The more extreme sample positions (i.e., 134 and 507) show an edge effect as the resolution dramatically worsens above order 100. The best spatial resolution occurs near sample position 384 and worsens slightly as one moves towards smaller sample positions (i.e. shorter wavelengths within an order). Differences in resolution between the large and small apertures are small. The small aperture shows an average improvement (over all orders) of 2.4% in resolution over the large aperture.   As is the case with the low-dispersion resolution studies, the NEWSIPS values show an improvement over IUESIPS measurements. Schiffer (1980) quoted FWHM values of 3.5 pixels for order 75 and 2.4 pixels for order 105. The NEWSIPS results for those orders are 3.3 pixels and 2.1 pixels, respectively. Analysis by de Boer et al. (1983) showed the best resolution of 2.4 pixels FWHM occurring near the center of the camera. The NEWSIPS results indicate a FWHM of 2.0 pixels in this same area (sample position 384). Also, Bianchi (1980) expressed FWHM as a function of order number, regardless of camera, according to the following formula:   FWHM = 7.23 - 0.04 X m where m is order number and the FWHM is   in pixels. Thus, for order 71, this indicates a FWHM of 4.4 pixels, a figure that is almost 20% higher than the NEWSIPS average measurement for that order.

The IUE scientific instrument contains two spectrographs which function independently. Each spectrograph has a prime and a redundant camera. The Long-Wavelength Prime (LWP) and Short-Wavelength Prime (SWP) cameras are the standard detectors (the LWR (Long-Wavelength Redundant) was used before Oct, 1983). For descriptions see Boggess et al.(1978a,b) and Coleman et al. (1977).   The Cameras   During an exposure the image is integrated in the SEC Vidicon section of the camera. There is no exposure meter so the length of the exposure must be estimated. The duration of the exposure is controlled by the on-board computer (OBC). The exposure length is quantized in units of 0.4096 seconds and can be modified in real-time. At the conclusion of the exposure the camera retains the image until a read is initiated. A read consists of a raster scan of 768 X 768 pixels. The video signal is digitized into one of 256 discrete levels (0 to 255 Data Numbers, or DN) by an eight-bit analog-to-digital converter. Since there is no on-board data recorder, the signal is concurrently transmitted to the ground station in real-time as the read scan is performed. At the highest available telemetry rate, 20 kilobits/sec, the transmission of an entire image and associated engineering data takes 5.24 minutes. The read is destructive, so if something happens to the quality of the received signal or to the ground data-handling system during the read, portions of the image can be permanently lost.   After a  camera has been read, residual images are erased and a reproducible electronic pedestal of 15 to 40 DN is produced by exposing the camera to a tungsten flood lamp, reading the camera with a defocused beam, and then exposing and reading again. This sequence is called a PREP. Standard and overexposed preps are available. Technical details are given in the IUE Camera User's Guide (Coleman et al. 1977).   The Spectrograph   With the LWP and SWP cameras,  the spectrographs cover the spectral ranges given in the Table below. Gaps in wavelength coverage in high dispersion are caused by truncation of the lower orders by the edge of the camera faceplate.

Although the various methods available for determining the fundamental dimensions do not always yield results which agree to within the limits set by the internal consistency of each (see Panek 1982), the Three Agency Coordination Meeting adopted recommended values for certain dimensions, which are presented in the following Table. These values do not reflect the true physical size of the apertures but rather the size as projected on the camera faceplate. As a result, each spectrograph has its own distinct measurement of the aperture sizes.

In addition, knowledge of the effective aperture area is needed to calibrate properly spectra of extended objects.     The camera plate scales have been redetermined (Garhart 1996; LWP 1.5644, LWR 1.5526, and SWP 1.5300 arcseconds per pixel) using the most recent measurements for the small-to-large aperture offsets in pixels (Table 2.2) and FES aperture center locations in arcseconds (Pitts 1988). These latest incarnations replace the oft-quoted plate scale figure of 1.525 arcseconds per pixel (Bohlin et al. 1980), a value that had been used for all three cameras. The aperture separations in the directions along and perpendicular to the dispersion are given in Table 2.2 for low dispersion. The corresponding values for the high-dispersion offsets are obtained by transposing the entries for the low-dispersion offsets along and perpendicular to the dispersion in Table 2.2. Refer to Figures 2.16 through 2.18 to determine the correct sign for the high- dispersion offsets (Garhart et al. 1997) .

The total offset is defined as the square root of the sum of the squares of the individual terms. The offsets along the dispersion have been incorporated into the geometric correction step such that the wavelength scales for the small and large apertures are aligned.   The geometry of the two entrance apertures in relation to the image scan lines and the high and low resolution dispersion directions are shown in Fig. 2.16-2.18 in the IUE NEWSIPS Manual (Garhart  et al. 1997). The figures are drawn in the geometrically corrected frame of reference with the origin at the upper left. Note particularly the fact that the displacement between the short wavelength large aperture (SWLA) and the short wavelength small aperture (SWSA) is very nearly along the echelle dispersion direction. Therefore, short wavelength high-dispersion images in which both apertures are exposed will result in nearly complete superposition of the large- and small-aperture spectra (with a wavelength offset). The displacement of the long wavelength large aperture (LWLA) and the long wavelength small aperture (LWSA) is less coincident with the echelle dispersion direction in those spectrographs, so that superposition of large- and small-aperture high-dispersion spectra is not as serious in the long wavelength spectrograph.   For the purposes of judging the extent and separation of the apertures in the spectral domain, the scales given in the following Table may be used in conjunction with the quantities given in the above tables. Note that in high dispersion a given shift along the dispersion corresponds closely to a constant Doppler velocity shift, whereas in low dispersion a given shift corresponds to a constant wavelength shift.

While the dominant effect is the camera resolution, telescope focus and stability of spacecraft pointing also play a major role in defining the resolution. In addition, it is well known that the camera resolution is highly wavelength-dependent.   According to the IUE Camera Users Guide (Coleman et al. 1977), the camera point spread function (PSF) consists of a narrow gaussian-like core having a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 2 to 5 pixels and a weak long-range tail. The actual resolution in either the spatial or spectral direction can be defined as a function of the FWHM. The Rayleigh criterion of instrumental resolution specifies that two spectra (spatial direction) or two spectral features (spectral direction) can be resolved provided their separation is as follows (Weinstein and Perez 1992):   d >- 0.849 x  FWHM   where d is the distance separating the two features (or spectra). The gaussian fitting routine used in this analysis was GAUSSFITS, taken from the IUE Data Analysis Center software library. This procedure outputs the one-sigma width of the fitted gaussian profile which was then converted to FWHM using the statistical equality (Bevington 1969):   FWHM = 2.3548 x sigma     ------------------------------------------------------------------------   Resolution Along the Dispersion   A study of the NEWSIPS spectral resolution was performed by measuring the FWHM of several features for the emission line sources V1016 Cyg, RR Tel, AG Dra, CI Cyg, and Z And. The analysis indicates a slight improvement in the NEWSIPS resolution (approximately 10 % or the SWP and 7 % or the LWR) over the previous results reported by Cassatella, Barbero, and Benvenuti (1985). Plots of the spectral resolution data are shown in Figure 2.19 of the NEWSIPS Manual (Garhart et al. 1997). The small-aperture data are slightly offset in wavelength from the large-aperture data for clarity.   LWP   - Large-aperture spectral resolution is best between 2700 and 2900 A with an average FWHM of 5.2 A and decreases to approximately 8.0 A on either side of this range. Small-aperture resolution is optimal between 2400 and 3000 A with an average FWHM of 5.5 A and decreases to 8.1 A at the extreme wavelengths.     LWR   - Maximum resolution in the large aperture occurs longward of 2300 A, with an average FWHM of 5.3 A, while shortward of this point the FWHM decreases to 7.7 A. Small-aperture resolution is best from 2700-3200 A, with an average FWHM of 5.4 A, and decreases to 7.7 A at 3350 A and 7.5 A shortward of 2400 A.       SWP   - The best resolution occurs around 1200 A, with a FWHM of 4.6 A in the large aperture and 3.0 A in the small aperture, and gradually worsens towards longer wavelengths: 6.7 A at 1900 A in the large aperture and 6.3 A in the small. On average, the small-aperture resolution is approximately 10% better than the large-aperture resolution.     Resolution Perpendicular to the Dispersion   The NEWSIPS spatial resolution has been determined by analyzing the spectra of several low-dispersion standard stars (viz., HD 60753, HD 93521, BD+33 2642, and BD+75 325). The FWHM of large- and small- aperture spectra were measured at several wavelengths and plotted (Figure 2.20 in the NEWSIPS Manual Garhart, et al. 1993). As is the case with the spectral resolution studies, the NEWSIPS values show, in general, an improvement. As is the case with the spectral resolution plots, the small-aperture data are slightly offset from the large-aperture data.   LWP   - The spatial resolution for the LWP is best near 3000 A where the FWHM for the large aperture is 2.4 pixels (3.6 arcsec), and decreases to values of around 3.0 pixels at the short and long wavelength ends of the spectrum. There is no significant difference between the large- and small-aperture spatial resolutions.   LWR   - The behavior of the LWR camera as a function of wavelength is similar to the LWP, with the smallest FWHM values for the large aperture of 2.6 pixels (3.9 arcsec) occurring near 3000 A, and increasing to 3.6 and 3.0 pixels at the wavelength extremes. The small aperture, unlike the other two cameras, shows a dramatic decrease in resolution of approximately 10%.       SWP   - The SWP camera shows the best spatial resolution near 1400 A with mean FWHM values for the large aperture of 2.7 pixels (4.1 arcsec), increasing slightly to 2.8 pixels at 1250 A, and 3.7 pixels at 1950 A. The SWP small-aperture resolution response is approximately the same as the large-aperture resolution.     --------------------------------------------------------------------------   * High-Dispersion Mode o Resolution Along the Dispersion o Resolution Perpendicular to the Dispersion   --------------------------------------------------------------------------   Resolution Along the Dispersion   A study of the spectral resolution in the high-dispersion mode was performed utilizing several methods. The first measured emission lines from small-aperture wavelength calibration (WAVECAL) images obtained using the on-board hollow cathode platinum-neon (Pt-Ne) calibration lamp. The second measured several features from the emission line sources V1016 Cyg and RR Tel and interstellar absorption line features from the calibration standard BD+75 325. The third method measured absorption features from the calibration standard HD 149757 (Zeta Oph). The WAVECAL images are useful in determining the spectral resolution as they are not affected by the telescope focus nor are they subject to astrophysical broadening. The Zeta Oph spectra are characterized by very narrow interstellar absorption features so they are also useful for measuring spectral resolution. Therefore, the measurements taken from WAVECAL and Zeta Oph images represent the best possible spectral resolution obtainable.     LWP   - The WAVECAL and large-aperture Zeta Oph resolution data are displayed in Figures 2.21 and 2.24 in the NEWSIPS manual (Nichols-Bohlin et al 1997). The results, along with the associated one-sigma error bars and linear fits (dashed line), are plotted as a function of order number in both wavelength and pixel space. The dotted line in the pixel space plots is the average of the resolution data over all orders. No small- aperture high-dispersion data of Zeta Oph is available. In addition, the standard star, RR Tel, and V1016 Cyg data were too noisy to yield suitable results. The large-aperture Zeta Oph measurements are quite similar to the small-aperture WAVECAL analysis. The spectral resolution in wavelength space is approximately 0.18 A FWHM at order 75 and linearly decreases (roughly) to 0.11 A at order 117. The pixel space data for both WAVECALs and Zeta Oph show the same improvement in resolution between orders 95 and 110.   The IUE Systems Design Report (GSFC 1976) lists 15,000 ([lambda/Delta lambda]) as the high-dispersion resolution for the long-wavelength cameras. This yields 0.22 A for order 69, 0.17 A for order 90, and 0.13 A for order 123. These numbers are comparable to the NEWSIPS results of 0.24 A, 0.15 A, and 0.12 A for these same orders. An analysis of IUESIPS spectral resolution was performed by Evans and Imhoff (1985) using FWHM measurements obtained from WAVECAL images. The results are as follows: 0.22 A for order 75, 0.17 A for order 83, 0.13 A for order 96, and 0.13 A for order 116. These figures are very similar to the NEWSIPS results of 0.20 A, 0.14 A, 0.15 A, and 0.13 A.   LWR   - The WAVECAL spectral resolution measurements are shown in Figure 2.22 in the NEWSIPS manual (Nichols-Bohlin et al. 1997) along with the corresponding linear fit and average. The FWHM trends (wavelength space) below order 80 are quite similar to the LWP figures (i.e., a linear dependence of FWHM on order number). The camera resolution in wavelength space is nearly constant for orders 80 through 115, with a slight degradation in LWR resolution above order 115. This trend is easily visible in the the pixel space resolution plot and is evident from the deviation of the FWHM measurements from the mean (dotted line).   Cassatella et al. (1981) and Cassatella and Martin (1982) report a nearly constant FWHM (wavelength space) as a function of order number for WAVECAL images processed through IUESIPS. The average FWHM from their analysis is approximately 0.18 A above order 81; a value which is higher than the corresponding NEWSIPS FWHM of 0.14 A. They report a FWHM of 0.22 A for order 72, which again is much higher than the NEWSIPS results of 0.19 A. Evans and Imhoff (1985) also measured spectral resolution using IUESIPS processed WAVECAL images. They present FWHM values of 0.19 A, 0.17 A, 0.16 A, and 0.15 A for orders 75, 83, 96, and 116, respectively. The corresponding NEWSIPS values for these same orders are: 0.19 A, 0.14 A, 0.15 A, and 0.14 A. Boggess et al. (1978) quote a constant FWHM of 0.19 A for WAVECAL images, regardless of order number. This contradicts all subsequent reports written on this subject as well as the NEWSIPS results shown here. Their analysis was performed early in the life of IUE; perhaps the camera characteristics had not yet stabilized at this period in time.   SWP   - The WAVECAL, Zeta Oph, and large- and small-aperture stellar source spectral resolution data are displayed in Figures 2.23, 2.25, 2.26, and 2.27 in the NEWSIPS manual (Nichols-Bohlin et al. 1997). As for LWP and LWR, the plots include one-sigma error bars and linear (dashed line) and mean (dotted line) fits to the data. In Figures 2.26 and 2.27, the emission line measurements for orders 111 and above were excluded from the analysis when performing the linear fit to the stellar data because they were highly discrepant. The spectral resolution in wavelength space for the WAVECAL, Zeta Oph, and stellar source images shows no dependence on wavelength within an order and a roughly linear dependence on order number. Unlike the LWP, the SWP resolution from the Zeta Oph analysis (Figure 2.25) is much worse than the corresponding WAVECAL data (Figure 2.23). The stellar source results are somewhat inconclusive for orders 111 and above. The emission line widths are dramatically higher than the corresponding absorption line measurements. This trend was also seen in the analysis by Grady (1985). The IUE Systems Design Report (GSFC 1976) quotes a figure of 10,000 ([lambda/Delta lambda]) for the spectral resolution in high-dispersion mode. This corresponds to a FWHM of approximately 0.2 A for order 66 and 0.1 A for order 125. This same trend is seen in the top plot (Figure 2.23) of the WAVECAL resolution analysis; the spectral resolution is essentially a constant value in pixel space (bottom plot). The stellar source resolution measurements in pixel space (bottom plot of Figures 2.26 and 2.27) show some degradation towards higher order numbers. In addition, the small-aperture data (Figure 2.27) indicates an 8% improvement in resolution over the large-aperture counterpart (Figure 2.26).   The general trend of the wavelength-space resolution for the WAVECAL images is approximately the same for every IUESIPS study that has been reviewed (i.e., Boggess et al. 1978, Cassatella et al. 1981, Cassatella and Martin 1982, and Evans and Imhoff 1985). That is, the camera resolution in wavelength space varies roughly linearly with order number and improves towards shorter wavelengths (0.19 A for order 69 and 0.09 for order 106). The results from analysis of WAVECAL images processed through NEWSIPS are almost identical to these figures. Penston (1979) reported SWP large-aperture FWHM values of 0.20 A for absorption lines and 0.24 A for emission lines. These figures are comparable with the average NEWSIPS results of 0.21 A and 0.23 A respectively. However, Penston's (1979) measurements for the small-aperture resolution are no better than the large aperture. This result could be supported by the NEWSIPS analysis as the apparent improvement in small-aperture resolution is less than the one-sigma error of the FWHM average for any given order. Grady (1985) assessed the effects of the two-gyro control mode on high-dispersion data using large-aperture RR Tel spectra. The mean resolution (averaged over all orders) from the Grady analysis (0.22 A) agrees with the average NEWSIPS resolution result.       Resolution Perpendicular to the Dispersion   The spatial resolution has been determined by analyzing the spectra of high-dispersion standard stars. The FWHM of several pairs of large and small-aperture line-by-line images were measured at five sample positions (viz., 134, 258, 384, 507, and 615). For each sample position, a three pixel wide average cross-cut perpendicular to the dispersion was taken and the widths of the orders measured using the gaussian fitting routine. The results for each image were in good agreement, so we averaged the results to yield a set of spectral widths for each aperture as a function of order number and sample position. The differences in telescope focus between the images were kept small so as to minimize the effect of focus on the resolution measurements (Perez et al. 1990). The database of spectra used for each camera contains a combination of optimally exposed images for the central orders and overexposed (in the central orders only) images for the extreme orders. The spatial resolution data and the one-sigma error bars for each sample position are plotted as a function of order number. The small-aperture data are horizontally offset to the left of the large-aperture data by half an order for clarity. A seventh-order polynomial fit to the data is also provided.   LWP   - Spatial resolution measurements of the FWHM are plotted in Figures 2.28-2.32 in the NEWSIPS manual (Nichols-Bohlin et al. 1997). The spatial resolution for sample position 384 is approximately 3.5 pixels FWHM at order 69 and decreases to 2.3 pixels at order 80 where it is roughly constant for the remaining orders. The spatial resolution degrades as one moves towards smaller sample positions and improves slightly (as compared with sample position 384) above order 90 for sample position 507. Small- aperture resolution shows an average improvement (over all orders and sample positions) of 4.6% over the large aperture. This difference is most apparent between orders 80 through 100 and at the smaller sample positions where it is as much as 8% for sample position 134. Unfortunately, no LWP high-dispersion spatial resolution studies could be found for IUESIPS data to compare against the NEWSIPS results.   LWR   - Figures 2.33-2.37 in the NEWSIPS manual (Nichols-Bohlin et al. 1997) show spatial resolution  of the FWHM plotted as a function of order number. The resolution trends for sample positions 134 through 384 are quite similar. The FWHM is approximately 3.0 pixels for order 69 and linearly decreases to 2.4 pixels at order 80 where it remains fairly constant for the remaining orders. For sample position 507, the FWHM is around 3.2 pixels for order 69 and linearly decreases to 2.6 pixels at order 80 where it then gradually decreases to 2.3 pixels at order 123. The behavior for sample position 615 demonstrates a rapid decrease in FWHM from 3.8 pixels at order 69 to 2.7 pixels at order 95 where it then gradually decreases to 2.3 pixels at order 120. The small-aperture resolution shows an improvement of approximately 4.7% over the large aperture.   The IUESIPS FWHM measurements obtained by Cassatella et al. (1981) using WAVECAL images are somewhat inconclusive. Their data only includes 5 orders (71, 73, 77, 81, and 90) and no mention was made of the sample positions at which these measurements were taken. Their numbers range from 3.5 pixels at order 71 to 2.7 pixels at order 90; values which are around 10% higher than the corresponding NEWSIPS FWHM measurements. The trends seen in the 2-D contour plots made by de Boer et al. (1983) are in good agreement with the NEWSIPS results. They show that for the central sample positions (i.e., 384) the FWHM starts out at 3.1 pixels at low order numbers and decreases to 2.8 pixels towards the center of the camera (e.g., order 90). The slight degradation in resolution seen in the central orders of Figure 2.35 is also apparent in the de Boer plots.   SWP   - Spatial resolution measurements of the FWHM are plotted in Figures 2.38-2.42 in the NEWSIPS manual (Nichols-Bohlin et al. 1997). The resolution trends, by order number, are, in general, the same for every sample position. The FWHM is around 4 pixels at order 66 (long wavelengths) and decreases to approximately 2 pixels near order 100 (short wavelengths). Unlike the indications from previous IUESIPS studies (e.g., Bianchi (1980), Schiffer (1980), and Cassatella et al. (1981)), this decrease is not linear with order number. A plateau of around 3.0 pixels FWHM occurs between orders 75 and 85. This trend is confirmed by the analysis of de Boer et al. (1983), which displayed the order widths using 2-D contour plots. The FWHM remains fairly constant above order 100 for sample positions 258 and 384. At these sample positions, the higher orders (100 and above) are well away from the edge of the camera. The more extreme sample positions (i.e., 134 and 507) show an edge effect as the resolution dramatically worsens above order 100. The best spatial resolution occurs near sample position 384 and worsens slightly as one moves towards smaller sample positions (i.e. shorter wavelengths within an order). Differences in resolution between the large and small apertures are small. The small aperture shows an average improvement (over all orders) of 2.4% in resolution over the large aperture.   As is the case with the low-dispersion resolution studies, the NEWSIPS values show an improvement over IUESIPS measurements. Schiffer (1980) quoted FWHM values of 3.5 pixels for order 75 and 2.4 pixels for order 105. The NEWSIPS results for those orders are 3.3 pixels and 2.1 pixels, respectively. Analysis by de Boer et al. (1983) showed the best resolution of 2.4 pixels FWHM occurring near the center of the camera. The NEWSIPS results indicate a FWHM of 2.0 pixels in this same area (sample position 384). Also, Bianchi (1980) expressed FWHM as a function of order number, regardless of camera, according to the following formula:   FWHM = 7.23 - 0.04 X m where m is order number and the FWHM is   in pixels. Thus, for order 71, this indicates a FWHM of 4.4 pixels, a figure that is almost 20% higher than the NEWSIPS average measurement for that order.

Analyzer of Space Plasmas and Energetic Atoms, 3rd version      ----------------------------------------------------------      (ASPERA-3)      ----------      Abstract. The general scientific objective of the ASPERA-3      experiment is to study the solar wind-atmosphere interaction and      characterize the plasma and neutral gas environment in the near-      Mars space through energetic neutral atom (ENA) imaging and      local charged particle measurements. The studies to be performed      address the fundamental question: How strongly do the      interplanetary plasma and electromagnetic fields affect the      Martian atmosphere? This question is directly related to the      problem of Martian dehydration. The ASPERA-3 instrument      comprises four sensors; two ENA sensors, electron and ion      spectrometers. The Neutral Particle Imager (NPI) provides      measurements of the integral ENA flux (0.1 -60 keV) with no mass      and energy resolution but high angular resolution. The Neutral      Particle Detector (NPD) provides measurements of the ENA flux,      resolving velocity (0.1 -10 keV) and mass (H and O) with a      coarse angular resolution. The electron spectrometer (ELS) is a      standard top-hat electrostatic analyzer in a very compact      design. These three sensors are located on a scanning platform      providing a 4pi coverage (maximum possible). The instrument also      contains an ion mass composition sensor, IMA (Ion Mass      Analyzer). Mechanically, IMA is a separate unit connected by a      cable to the ASPERA-3 main unit. IMA provides ion measurements      in the energy range 0.01 - 40 keV/q for the main ion components      H+, H2+, He+, O+, with 20-80 amu/q.       Neutral Particle Imager (NPI)     -----------------------------      The Neutral Particle Imager (NPI) provides measurements of the      integral ENA flux with no mass and energy resolution but with 5      deg x 11 deg angular resolution. The intrinsic field of view is      9 deg x 344 deg. The sensor utilizes a graphite surface to      suppress the UV background. ENAs incident on the surface at a      grazing angle of 20 deg are reflected and/or cause ion      sputtering. An MCP stack detects the reflected particles and      sputtered fragments with a discrete anode.       Neutral Particle Detector (NPD)     -----------------------------      The Neutral Particle Detector (NPD) provides measurements of the      ENA differential flux over the energy range 100 eV - 10 keV      resolving H and O with a coarse 5 deg x 30 deg angular      resolution. The sensor consists of two identical detectors each      with a 9 deg x 90 deg intrinsic field of view. The measurement      technique is based on a principle similar to NPI. ENAs incident      on a surface at a grazing angle of 15 deg are reflected and      cause secondary electron emission. The secondary electrons are      transported to an MCP assembly, which gives the START signal.      The reflected ENAs hit the second surface and again produce the      secondary electrons used to generate the STOP signal. The time-      of-flight (TOF) electronics give the ENA velocity. The pulse-      height distribution analysis of the STOP signals is used to      provide a rough determination of the ENA mass.       Electron Spectrometer (ELS)     ---------------------------      The ELectron Spectrometer (ELS) provides electron measurements      in the energy range 0.01 - 20 keV. The intrinsic field of view      is 10 deg x 360 deg. The 360 deg aperture is divided into 16      sectors. The sensor is a standard top-hat electrostatic analyzer      in a very compact design.       Ion Mass Analyzer (IMA)     -----------------------      The Ion Mass Analyzer (IMA) is a separate unit connected by a      cable to the ASPERA-3 experiment. IMA provides ion measurements      in the energy range 0.01 - 40 keV/q for the main ion components      H+, H2+, He+, O+, and for the group of molecular ions 20 < M/q <      ~80. IMA has a 4.6 deg x 360 deg field of view. Electrostatic      sweeping performs elevation (+/- 45 deg) coverage. The IMA      sensor is a spherical electrostatic analyzer followed by a      circular magnetic separating section. A large diameter MCP with      a discrete anode images the matrix azimuth x mass.       Scientific Objectives   =====================     The ASPERA-3 experiment fulfills the Mars Express mission     objective of studying the interaction of the atmosphere with the     interplanetary medium by:       * Remote measurements of energetic neutral atoms (ENA) in order       to       (a) investigate the interaction between the solar wind and           Martian atmosphere,       (b) characterize quantitatively the impact of plasma processes           on the atmospheric evolution, and       (c) obtain the global plasma and neutral gas distributions in           the near-Mars environment.       * in situ measurements of ions and electrons in order to       (a) complement the ENA images (electrons and multiply-charged           ions cannot be imaged)       (b) to study local characteristics of plasma (dynamics and fine           structure of boundaries), and       (c) provide undisturbed solar wind parameters necessary for           interpretation of ENA images.       The scientific objectives of the ASPERA-3 experiment are:       1) Scientific objective: Determine the instantaneous global           distributions of plasma and neutral gas near Mars        Associated measurements: ENAs originating from the shocked           solar wind        Measurement requirements:  Measure the ENA flux in the energy           range tens eV - few keV with 4pi coverage.

Calibration   ===========     Calibration of the ASPERA-3 sensors can be divided up in:       1. Characterization, tests and selection of detectors (MCPs and        secondary emitting surfaces).     2. Characterization and final calibration of the integrated        sensor units.     3. Functional tests of the sensors in the fully mounted (flight)        configuration.       All sensor units were fully calibrated, and some preliminary     functional tests were made in the fully mounted, flight,     configuration in June 2002. The final functional tests were     successfully carried out during the retrieval period 18 November     - 9 December 2002.       The Neutral Particle Imager, NPI, was calibrated in Nov-Dec 2001     at the IRF ion source in Kiruna. The sensitivity of the     instrument and the characterization of the acceptance field of     view were obtained using ions (e.g. N+, H2O+, and H+). The ion     deflector properties versus energy were calibrated for various     deflector voltages. The integral efficiency of the secondary     surface were found to range between 2% and 24% (MCP bias     dependent). Azimuthal field-of-view slightly broader than nominal     (13.5 deg). NPI-calibration performance as expected. The ideal     NPI field-of-view, 4pi, is covered in half a scan of the scanning     platform.       The Neutral Particle Detector, NPD, is a completely new design     using secondary emitting surfaces and a geometry that has not     been flown before. NPD therefore underwent extensive     characterisation tests and calibrations during the spring of     2002. The results of the calibrations at the IRF calibration     facility in Kiruna were very successful, the NPD performance     surpassing expectations. NPD is even more sensitive than     expected. The mass and energy resolving capability of the     instrument were as expected in the energy range ~1 - 10 keV. The     NPD field-of-view, 2pi, is covered after a scan of the scanning     platform.       The Electron Spectrometer unit, ELS, was calibrated at MSSL in     London, fall 2001. The energy resolution was found to be better     than expected, which is an advantage for studying the narrow     electron peaks expected as a result of the solar impact on the     ionosphere and upper atmosphere. The geometric factor is a factor     of five less than nominal, but the loss of sensitivity is, for     this mission, considered to be well compensated by the improved     energy resolution of ELS. Calibrations and tests are considered     to be successful.       IMA was successfully calibrated January to March, 2002.     Performance largely as expected, except that the upper energy     limit was lowered from 40 keV to 30 keV. Mass resolution, an     energy and angular characteristics also as expected.     Operation of ASPERA-3   =====================     The ASPERA-3 experiment contains four sensor units and the     scanner. Each sensor unit measures different components of the     near-Mars plasma and can be operated in different modes. To     handle available power and telemetry resource requirements in the     most efficient way and to inhibit too large number of individual     modes, there are eight basic TM modes (macro modes): (1) OFF     mode, (2) Safe mode, (3) Housekeeping mode, (4) Calibration mode,     (5) Low mode, (6) Normal mode, (7) High mode, and (8) Burst mode.       (1) OFF mode. The instrument is off although the external heaters         are on and controlled by the instrument thermistors.       (2) Safe mode. At experiment power switch on, the instrument         enters to a safe mode. In the safe mode the software is run         in PROM although the software allows command execution,         housekeeping TM generation, RAM dumping and jumping to the         RAM code. The instrument also enters to the safe mode in the         following cases:            * the checksum of the RAM code fails            * watch dog is not reset         The safe mode is a fully operational mode, and the instrument         is listening for other commands.       (3) Housekeeping mode. In this mode none of the ASPERA-3 sensors         are taking scientific data and the DPU delivers housekeeping         data to OBDH. This mode is to monitor the instrument status.       (4) Calibration mode. In this mode each of the different sensors         is switched on individually for check-out and in-flight         calibration purposes.     (5-8) Low, Normal, High, Burst modes. These modes are for the         scientific data taking. The modes differ from each other in         the total amount of data produced and the structure of TM         packages although individual settings defining the sensor         configurations might be the same for different modes.       The choice of the instrument operational mode for each phase of     the mission is due to available power and telemetry as well as     scientific requirements.       The scanning platform has three operational modes: scanning mode,     stepping mode, and fixed position mode. In the scanning mode, the     platform performs scans with three pre-selected speeds 32, 64,     and 128 sec in one 0 deg - 180 deg scan. In the stepping mode the     platform moves in steps through the angle defined by a command.     The time the platform rests in each position is also commanded.     In the fixed position mode the platform moves to a commandable     position from 0 deg to 180 deg and rests there until the scanner     mode changes.       All four ASPERA-3 sensors, ELS, NPI, NPD1 and NPD2, IMA, can be     run independently although the individual sensor bit rates are     set by a macro command. The raw data are compressed by     integration over time, energy, azimuth, mass as well as using     log-compression of 16-bit words to 8-bit words, masking, and     look-up tables (NPD). The processed and formatted data are loss-     less compressed by the USES algorithm (Universal Source Encoding     for Space, CCSDS 111.0-W-2).

urn:esa:psa:context:instrument:mex.hrsc,HIGH RESOLUTION STEREO CAMERA for MEX,HIGH RESOLUTION STEREO CAMERA,"       Instrument Overview   ===================     The High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC), originally developed     for the Russian-led Mars-96 mission, was selected as part of the     Orbiter payload for ESA s Mars Express mission. The HRSC is a     pushbroom scanning instrument with nine CCD line detectors     mounted in parallel in the focal plane. Its unique feature is the     ability to obtain near-simultaneous imaging data of a specific     site at high resolution, with along-track triple stereo, four     colours and five different phase angles, thus avoiding any time-     dependent variations of the observational conditions. An     additional Super-Resolution Channel (SRC) a framing device will     yield nested images in the metre-resolution range for detailed     photogeologic studies. The spatial resolution from the nominal     periapsis altitude of 250 km will be 10 m px 1, with an image     swath of 53 km, for the HRSC and 2.3 m px 1 for the SRC.     During the mission s nominal operational lifetime of 1 Martian     year (2 Earth years) and assuming an average HRSC data transfer     share of 40%, it will be possible to cover at least 50% of the     Martian surface at a spatial resolution of d 15 m px 1. More than     70% of the surface can be observed at a spatial resolution of d     30 m px 1, while more than 1% will be imaged at better than 2.5 m     px 1. The HRSC will thus close the gap between the medium- to     low resolution coverage and the very high-resolution images of     the Mars Observer Camera on the Mars Global Surveyor mission and     the in situ observations and measurements by landers. The HRSC     will make a major contribution to the study of Martian     geosciences, with special emphasis on the evolution of the     surface in general, the evolution of volcanism, and the role of     water throughout Martian history. The instrument will obtain     images containing morphologic and topographic information at high     spatial and vertical resolution, allowing the improvement of the     cartographic base down to scales of 1:50 000. The experiment will     also address atmospheric phenomena and atmosphere-surface     interactions, and will provide urgently needed support for     current and future lander missions as well as for exobiological     studies. The goals of HRSC on Mars Express will not be met by any     other planned mission or instrument.       Science Objectives   ==================     The HRSC directly addresses two of the main scientific goals of     the Mars Express mission (high-resolution photogeology and     surface-atmosphere interactions) and significantly supports     another two (atmospheric studies and mineralogical mapping).     In addition, the imagery will make a major contribution to     characterising the landing site geology and its surroundings for     the Mars Express and other Mars missions (e.g. NASA's Mars     Exploration Rovers).     The scientific objectives and measurement goals have been     formulated by an international team of 45 Co-Investigators (Co-     Is) from 10 countries under the leadership of the Principal     Investigator (PI).     The image data will focus on:     - characterisation of the surface structure and morphology at       high spatial resolution of e10 m px 1;     - characterisation of the surface topography at high spatial and       vertical resolution;     - characterisation of morphological details at super-resolution       of up to 2 m px 1;     - terrain classification at high spatial resolution by means of       colour imaging;   refinement of the geodetic control network       and the Martian cartographic base;     - characterisation of atmospheric phenomena;     - characterisation of physical properties of the surface through       multi-phase angle measurement;     - observation of Phobos and Deimos.

Schoeneich (Jena-Optronik)       Instrument Specification   ========================     The HRSC instrument consists of the camera unit containing the     HRSC stereo colour scanner and the Super-Resolution Channel     (SRC), and of the digital unit. The unique capability of the HRSC     stereo colour scanner is to obtain quasi-simultaneously high-     resolution images in three-line stereo, in four colours and at     five phase angles. The combination with the SRC makes it a five-     in-one camera:     - the along-track acquisition of stereo imagery avoids changes       in atmospheric and illumination conditions which so far have       caused severe problems in the photogrammetric evaluation of       stereo images acquired at well-separated times;     - the triple stereo images permit robust stereo reconstruction,       yielding Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) at a vertical resolution       similar to the high pixel resolution of the nadir sensor, with       10 m px 1 at 250 km altitude (periapsis);     - the colour images enable terrain classification and provide       information on compositional variations and surface weathering       as a complement to the more specific (but with lower spatial       resolution) mineralogical information obtained by the imaging       spectrometer of Mars Express;     - the multiphase imagery will address the physical properties of       the Martian soil (roughness, grain size, porosity) via       photogrammetric data evaluation by providing a second stereo       angle triplet (in essence quintuple stereo);     - the super-resolution imagery, nested in the broader swath of       the scanner with a spatial resolution of 2.3 m px 1 at       periapsis, will serve as the magnifying lens to analyse surface       morphology at even greater detail.       The HRSC stereo colour scanner is a multi-sensor pushbroom     instrument, with nine CCD line sensors mounted in parallel     delivering nine superimposed image swaths. Originally, it was     developed as the HRSC instrument for the Russian Mars-96 mission.     Two fully tested and calibrated Flight Models were prepared, and     only minor modifications to the remaining version were required     to satisfy the Mars Express interface requirements. The stereo     colour scanner comprises a baffle, optics, optical bench,     spectral filters, CCD sensors lines, sensor electronics and     thermal control system. The technical design is defined by:     - single-optics design;     - CCD line arrays with 5272 pixels each;     - nine detectors for simultaneous stereo and colour imaging,       and for multi-phase angle measurements;     - CCDs and sensor electronics implemented in high-reliability       hybrid, low-noise and low-power technology;     - implementation of the CCD-control unit in ASICs.       The SRC is a framing device and uses an interline CCD detector to     cope with the very short exposure and read-out times. It is based     on an instrument development for the Rosetta Lander and the     design is characterised by:     - CCD area array interline detector with 1024 x 1032 pixels;     - highly miniaturised and low-power detector and control       electronics;     - compact 3D multi-chip module technology using thin-film       multilayer metallisation, dycostrate, plasma-etching and chip-       on-wire technology;     - selectable dynamic range of 8- and 14-bit per pixel;     - internal data buffer to store eight 8-bit (or four 14-bit)       images;     - lightweight Maksutov-Cassegrain telescope with a focal length       of 975 mm       INSTRUMENT OPERATION   ====================     In general, the HRSC (Camera Head) and the SRC will be operated     simultaneously. However, the Camera Head and the SRC also can be     operated separately.       The SRC can be operated     - in the direct mode (direct input into the DU)       In the case of joint operations with the Camera Head (CH) this       mode requires that the 9 CCD line signals are processed by three       of the four signal chains (which reduces the possible number of       configurations or macro modes). The fourth signal chain is       exclusively used for SRC.       The SRC data is fully integrated in the basic HRSC data stream.     - in the buffer mode       This mode is applicable for all HRSC macro modes. Eight 8-bit or       four 14-bit SRC images can be stored in an internal buffer. At       the end of an imaging session these images are processed by the       signal chain #4.     For each of the SRC operational modes the following exposure modes     can be selected by command:     - spot mode: single images     - raster mode: images taken at a predefined time distance     - contiguous imaging: raster imaging with such a distance between       subsequent exposures that a contiguous image strip is generated       The HRSC instrument output rate is mainly defined by the scan     frequency of the Camera Head, i.e. it changes with the S/C     altitude. The SRC images are fully embedded in the HRSC instrument     data stream. They reach not more than 10% in the entire data     stream even in the contiguous mode. The HRSC data output rate is     reduced by two measures:     - pixel binning Each of the four signal chains can be commanded to       sum pixels in flight and across flight direction: 1x1, 2x2, 4x4       and 8x8 (macropixel formats). One signal chain can handle only -       one sensor 1x1 or - up to two sensors 2x2 or - up to four       sensors 4x4 or - up to eight sensors 8x8 or - SRC images     - Data compression Each of the four signal chains performs in       parallel an on-line (hardware) data compression with a modified       JPEG algorithm. The compression rate is defined not directly but       only through a quality factor given by command. In general we       assume compression factors from 6..10 for nominal operations.       The actual output at a certain time instance rate depends on the       compression behaviour (scene contents, buffer handling of the       hardware etc) and cannot be exactly predicted.

urn:esa:psa:context:instrument:mex.marsis,MARS ADVANCED RADAR FOR SUBSURFACE AND IONOSPHERE SOUNDING for MEX,MARS ADVANCED RADAR FOR SUBSURFACE AND IONOSPHERE SOUNDING,"     Instrument Overview   ===================     MARSIS is a multi-frequency nadir-looking pulse-limited radar sounder and     altimeter, which uses synthetic aperture techniques and a secondary     receiving antenna to enhance subsurface reflections. MARSIS can be     effectively operated at any altitude lower than 800 km in subsurface     sounding mode, and below 1200 km in ionosphere sounding mode. The     instrument consists of two antenna assemblies and an electronics assembly.     Maximum penetration depths are achieved at the lowest frequencies, and     penetration is in the order of a few kilometres, depending on the nature     of the material being sounded. On the dayside of Mars, the solar wind-     induced ionosphere does not allow subsurface sounding at frequencies below     approximately 3.5 MHz, as the signal would be reflected back at the radar     without reaching the surface. To achieve greater subsurface probing     depths, operations on the night side of Mars are thus strongly preferred.       Scientific Objectives   =====================     The primary objective of MARSIS is to map the distribution of water, both     liquid and solid, in the upper portions of the crust of Mars. Detection of     such reservoirs of water addresses key issues in the hydrologic, geologic,     climatic and possible biologic evolution of Mars, including the current     and past global inventory of water, mechanisms of transport and storage of     water, the role of liquid water and ice in shaping the landscape of Mars,     the stability of liquid water and ice at the surface as an indication of     climatic conditions, and the implications of the hydrologic history for     the evolution of possible Martian ecosystems.       Three secondary objectives are defined for the MARSIS experiment. The     first objective consists in probing the subsurface of Mars, to     characterise and map geologic units and structures in the third dimension.     An additional secondary objective consists in acquiring information about     the surface of Mars: the specific goals of this part of the experiment are     to characterise the roughness of the surface at scales of tens of meters     to kilometres, to measure the radar reflection coefficient of the surface     and to generate a topographic map of the surface at approximately 15-30     kilometres lateral resolution. A final secondary objective is to use     MARSIS as an ionosphere sounder to characterize the interactions of the     solar wind with the ionosphere and upper atmosphere of Mars.       Calibration   ===========     In order to get the predicted performances in the dual antenna clutter     cancellation procedure, and consequently to reach the expected penetration     depth, the null of the monopole antenna has to be determined.       An estimation of the direction of the null in the monopole channel can be     obtained by acquiring calibration data over a rough (related to the     wavelength) area (range - azimuth transform to detect the null direction).     This requires MARSIS to operate at full power with the pitch set at zero     degree and over a rough terrain to get a strong surface clutter and with     proper illumination condition in order to use all the frequencies.       After data analysis, the pitch (along track) null region direction is     identified with a coarse accuracy; around this point we require S/C     manoeuvre to get the 1 degree accuracy required. The following procedure     has been applied over a smooth area:       - Every orbit had a different roll (cross track) pointing: from -2 to 2     degrees with steps of 1 degree       - In each orbit the pitch pointing has been varied continuously (with     steps of 1 degree) during the pericenter passage from -4 to 1 degrees.       Operational Considerations   ==========================     MARSIS has been designed to perform subsurface sounding at each orbit when     the altitude is below 800 Km. A highly eccentric orbit such as the     baseline orbit places the spacecraft within 800 km from the surface for a     period of about 26 minutes. This would allow mapping of about 100 degrees     of arc on the surface of Mars each orbit, allowing extensive coverage at     all latitudes within the nominal mission duration. To achieve this global     coverage MARSIS has been designed to support both day side and night side     operations, although performances are maximized during night time (solar     zenith angle > 80 degrees), when the ionosphere plasma frequency drops off     significantly and the lower frequency bands, which have greater subsurface     penetration capability, can be used.       Active Ionosphere Sounding is also carried out by MARSIS at certain passes     when the spacecraft is below 1200 Km of altitude, both during day and     night time.       The instrument is commanded by means of two tables, the Operations     Sequence Table and the Parameters Table, which are up-linked from ground     as part of the instrument programming and commanding, and loaded in the     instrument memory at switch-on.       Detectors   =========     MARSIS antenna assembly consists of two antennas, a dipole and a monopole.     The primary dipole antenna, parallel to the surface and to the direction     of spacecraft motion, is used for transmission of pulses and for reception     of pulse echoes reflected by the Martian surface, subsurface and     ionosphere. The secondary monopole antenna, oriented along the nadir, has     a null in the nadir direction, and it is thus sensitive to off-nadir     surface returns. Such surface returns could mask subsurface echoes     arriving at the same time, and are thus an undesired contribution to the     received echoes (clutter): the monopole antenna is used in subsurface     sounding to remove clutter from the signal received by the dipole.       Electronics   ===========     Due to limits in permitted data rate for data transmission between the     instrument and the solid state mass memory of the spacecraft, and     constraints on the data volume that can be down-linked to Earth, most data     processing is performed within the instrument itself. Major tasks     performed by MARSIS digital processing unit are Doppler processing, range     processing, and multi-looking. Different operative modes requires all,     some or none of these capabilities.       Conceptually, Doppler processing of pulse echoes consists in artificially     adding a delay, corresponding to a phase shift of the complex signal, to     the samples of each pulse, and then in summing the samples so as to allow     the constructive sum of the signal component whose delay (phase shift)     from one pulse to the next corresponds to a desired direction (usually     nadir or close to nadir). This is called also synthetic aperture     processing, and is used to improve both horizontal resolution in the     along-track direction and signal-to- noise ratio: horizontal resolution     becomes that of an equivalent antenna whose length is equal to the segment     of the spacecraft trajectory over which pulse echoes are summed     coherently, whereas signal-to-noise ratio improves by a factor equal to     the number of coherently summed pulses.       Range processing consists in computing the correlation between the     transmitted pulse and received echoes. If the transmitted amplitude is     constant during the pulse, the correlation with an echo identical to the     transmitted signal takes the form of a (sin x)/x pulse. This process,     called also range compression, is performed on ground for most subsurface     sounding modes, on the digitally sampled data, to properly compensate     ionospheric effects: accurate coherent pulse compression requires in fact     detailed knowledge of the modulation of the returning signals, whose phase     structure is distorted in their (two-way) propagation through the     ionosphere.       Multi-look processing is the non-coherent sum of echoes (that is, phase     information in the complex signal is ignored), after both Doppler and     range processing, performed to increase the signal-to- noise ratio and     reduce speckle, this last being the effect of random fluctuations in the     return signal observed from an area-extensive target represented by one     pixel. Because this process requires that multiple observations of the     same area are available for the summing, it spans across several frames in     which the same spot on the surface is observed at slightly different     angles of incidence in different adjacent synthetic apertures.       Filters   =======     In MARSIS subsurface sounding, the same group of echoes undergoing     synthetic aperture processing can be used to focus multiple points on the     surface, by changing the phase shift from echo to echo so as to produce     constructive interference in different directions. The resulting processed     echoes are also called Doppler filters.       Operational Modes   =================     For subsurface sounding, a chirp signal is generated and transmitted at     each operating frequency for a period of about 250 microseconds. The     instrument then switches to a receive mode and records the echoes from the     surface and subsurface. The total transmit-receive cycle lasts a few     milliseconds, depending on altitude. The received signals are passed to a     digital-to-analogue converter and compressed in range and azimuth. The     azimuth integration accumulates a few seconds of data and results in an     along-track footprint size of 10 km. The cross-track footprint size is on     the order of 20 km. Digital on-board processing greatly reduces the output     data rate to 75 kilobits per second or less. For each along-track     footprint, echo profiles show the received power as a function of time     delay, with a depth resolution of 50-100 m, depending on the wave     propagation speed in the crust.       Active ionosphere sounding consists of transmitting a pulse from MARSIS at     a frequency f, and then measuring the intensity of the reflected radar     echo as a function of time delay.  For a radar signal incident on a     horizontally stratified ionosphere, a strong specular reflection occurs     from the level where the wave frequency is equal to the electron plasma     frequency. By measuring the time delay for the reflected signal     (controlled by the group delay), the plasma frequency, and therefore the     electron density can be derived as a function of height. The frequency of     the transmitted pulse is systematically stepped to yield time delay as a     function of frequency.       In addition to subsurface and ionosphere sounding, MARSIS is capable of     two more data collection modes that are not science-related, but are     rather used for the testing of the instrument. Hardware calibration mode     and receive-only mode are identical in their sequencing of data     acquisition, differing only for the fact that in receive-only mode no     pulses are actually transmitted. In both modes, 80 echoes are collected     from both antennas at one of the frequency bands used in subsurface     sounding, stored in a buffer as they come out of the analogue-to-digital     converter, and, because the resulting data rate would be too high for the     spacecraft data bus, transferred to the spacecraft mass memory over a time     span eighty times longer than the one used for data acquisition.       Subsystems   ==========     From the functional point of view, the instrument can be split into three     subsystems:       - Antenna (ANT)     - Radio Frequency Subsystem (RFS)     - Digital Electronics Subsystem (DES)       From the mechanical point of view, DES and the receiver section (RX) of     the RFS subsystem are allocated in the same box inside the spacecraft.     Inside the spacecraft is also allocated the mechanical box for the     transmission electronics (TX). The dipole antenna and monopole antenna are     located outside the spacecraft.       Measured Parameters   ===================     MARSIS data are organized into groups of echoes called frames. A frame     contains one or more echoes, with or without on-board processing. Each     echo, depending on the kind of processing it underwent, is recorded either     as a time series of signal samples, or as the complex spectrum of the     signal itself produced by means of a FFT. Scientific data in a frame are     complemented by a set of ancillary data, produced by the instrument and     recording parameter values used in pulse transmission, echo reception and     on-board processing.

urn:esa:psa:context:instrument:mex.mrs,MARS EXPRESS ORBITER RADIO SCIENCE for MEX,MARS EXPRESS ORBITER RADIO SCIENCE,"       Instrument Overview     ===================       Mars Express (MEX) Radio Science investigations utilized       instrumentation with elements on both the spacecraft and ground       (Earth).  Much of this was shared equipment, being used for       routine telecommunications as well as for Radio Science.       Ground systems were provided by the European Space Agency (ESA)       at New Norcia, Australia, and by the U.S. National Aeronautics       and Space Administration (NASA) Deep Space Network (DSN) at       sites in Australia, Spain, and the United States.  Performance       and calibration of both the spacecraft and ground systems       directly affected the radio science data accuracy and played a       major role in determining the quality of the results.         The spacecraft was able to receive and transmit signals at both       S-band (approximately 13 cm wavelength) and X-band       (approximately 3.5 cm). The spacecraft transmissions could use       either an onboard oscillator for the frequency reference ('one-       way' mode) or a signal transmitted from the ground ('two-way'       mode); in the latter case, either an S- or X-band signal from       the ground could be used as the reference.         Science Objectives     ==================       Two different types of radio science measurements were carried       out with Mars Express:           Radiometric Measurements:  Ground stations have the ability         to transmit coded and uncoded waveforms which can be echoed         by distant spacecraft.  Analysis of the received coding         allows navigators to determine the distance to the         spacecraft; analysis of Doppler shift on the carrier signal         allows estimation of the line-of-sight spacecraft velocity.         Range and Doppler measurements are used to calculate the         spacecraft trajectory and to infer gravity fields of objects         near the spacecraft.  NB: Doppler measurements can be made in         one-way but are usually more accurate if carried out in two-         way mode.           Radio Propagation Measurements: Ground stations can record         spacecraft signals that have propagated through or been         scattered from target media.  Measurements of signal         parameters after wave interactions with surfaces,         atmospheres, rings, and plasmas are used to infer physical         and electrical properties of the target.  Radio propagation         measurements can be conducted in either one-way or two-way         mode.         These measurements were applied - separately and together - to       Mars science objectives such as inference of local gravity       field anomalies, mass of Phobos, temperature and pressure of       the atmosphere, electron density in the ionosphere, scattering       properties of the surface, and structure of the solar wind.           Gravity Measurements       --------------------         Measurement of the gravity field provides significant         constraints on inferences about the interior structure of         Mars.  Precise, detailed study of the spacecraft motion in         Mars orbit can yield the mass distribution of the planet.         Topographic data, such as those obtained by the Mars Global         Surveyor (MGS) Mars Orbiting Laser Altimeter (MOLA), form a         critical adjunct to these measurements since only after the         gravitational effects are adjusted for topography can the         gravity anomalies be interpreted geophysically.           Mars Express studies of the gravity field emphasized the         local and time varying characteristics of the field; but the         first task was to determine the global field. Doppler and         range tracking measurements yield accurate spacecraft         trajectory solutions.  Simultaneously with reconstruction of         the spacecraft orbit, observation equations for field         coefficients and a small number of ancillary parameters can         be solved. This type of gravity field solution is essential         for characterizing tectonic phenomena and can also be used to         study localized features. Differences in the solution can be         used to infer variation of low degree and order coefficients         on time scales of months to years - such as might be expected         from seasonal mass exchange between polar cap deposits and         the atmosphere. These kind of global gravity measurements         were typically conducted around apocenter. Gravity models         based on MGS data have been published by [LEMOINEETAL2001]         and [YUANETAL2001].  Early results from studies of time         variability in the MGS results have been presented by         [ZUBER&SMITH2002]. Global gravity measurements were typically         done around Mars Express Apocenter.           'Short-arc' line-of-sight Doppler tracking measurements         obtained when the Earth-to-spacecraft line-of-sight is within         a few degrees of the orbit plane provide the highest         resolution of local features. The results from this type of         observation typically are presented as contoured acceleration         profiles of specific features (e.g., craters, volcanoes,         etc.) or line-of-sight acceleration maps of specific regions.         The high spatial resolution of these products makes them         especially useful to geophysicists for study of features in         the size range of 300 to 1000 km. These kind of measurements         were typically conducted during Mars Express pericenter over         interesting geophysical structures like: Tempe Fossae and         Olympus Mons. An early example of such analysis was conducted         on Viking Orbiter 2 data and published by [SJOGREN1979].           A possible by-product of the gravity field analysis is         information on the density structure of the upper atmosphere         [TRACADISETAL2001].         Phobos flyby       ------------         During the Mars Express Mission several close flybys at         Phobos occurred. When the distance between orbiter and Phobos         is < 500 km Mars Radio Science will be able to derive the         mass and density of the moon and to determine the Phobos         orbit to great accuracy.         Radio Occultation Measurements       ------------------------------         Atmospheric measurements by the method of radio occultation         contribute to an improved understanding of structure,         circulation, dynamics, and transport in the atmosphere of         Mars.  These results are based on detailed analysis of the         radio signal phase as the ray path enters and exits         occultation by the planet, leading to profiles of temperature         and pressure in the neutral atmosphere and profiles of         electron density in the ionosphere.           Retrieval of atmospheric profiles requires coherent samples         with a sample rate of at least 10 per second of the radio         signal that has propagated through the atmosphere, plus         accurate knowledge of the spacecraft trajectory.  The latter         was obtained from the MEX Flight Dynamics Team.  Solutions         from MEX occultations provided neutral atmospheric structure         to about 50 km from the surface and electron densities over a         range of about 50 km centered on the altitude of the         ionization peak.           Spatial and temporal coverage in radio occultation         experiments are determined by the geometry of the spacecraft         orbit and the dates and times at which occultation data are         acquired.  Since MEX radio occultation experiments were         conducted on a regular basis using a polar orbit, there was         extensive occultation coverage at high northern and southern         latitudes (e.g., beyond 60 degrees).  As the orbit appeared         to drift from edge-on to nearly broadside (as viewed from         Earth), occultation points moved toward the equator and the         entry/exit angle approached grazing.  During the first Mars         year of MEX operations, there were three occultation         'seasons' between which the spacecraft was not occulted for         several months at a time. In the year 2004 only Occultation         Ingress measurements were performed.         Bistatic Surface Scattering Measurements       ------------------------------------------         The spacecraft high-gain antenna (HGA) could also be pointed         toward the surface of the planet.  The strength of the signal         scattered from the illuminated area could be measured and the         results interpreted in terms of the dielectric constant of         the surface material.  The model for interpretation assumes         Fresnel reflection at the specular angle. Under certain         circumstances, the dispersion of the echo (its spectral         width) could be interpreted in terms of the surface roughness         on scales comparable to the wavelength.  One such MGS         bistatic radar was conducted over the Mars Polar Lander/Deep         Space 2 site in May 2000 [SIMPSON&TYLER2001].           For a few seconds before and after geometrical occultation         the HGA illuminated a small strip of surface as well as the         atmosphere.  In some cases, an echo could be observed from         the surface.  The interpretation of these transient echoes is         more difficult than for the case above, possibly involving         diffraction and surface waves in addition to Fresnel         reflection.           On Mars Express this operation was done in ONED mode. That is         no uplink but with X- and S-Band downlink. The HGA was         pointed to Mars. Pointing was inertial. That is no slew was         performed during the measurement.           Solar Scintillation and Faraday Rotation Experiments       ----------------------------------------------------         Solar scintillation and Faraday rotation experiments were         conducted to improve understanding of the structure and         dynamics of the solar corona and wind.  Because Mars orbits         the Sun, spacecraft like MEX are transported behind the solar         disk, as seen from Earth.  Radio waves propagating between         MEX and Earth stations are refracted and scattered by the         solar plasma [WOO1993].  Intensity fluctuations can be         related to fluctuations in electron density along the path,         while Doppler or phase scintillations can be related to both         electron density fluctuations and also the speed of the solar         wind.  Many plasma effects decrease as the square of the         radio frequency; scintillations are about an order of         magnitude stronger at S-band than X-band.  The first solar         conjunction observations with MEX were conducted during the         solar conjunction season of 2004: 16.8.2004 - 22.10.2004.         Measurements during solar conjunction should be typically         been done in TWOD-S configuration. That is in two-way mode         with S-Band uplink and coherent and simultaneous in X- and S-         Band. However, due to problems to lock S-Band in the 2004         conjunction season. The TWOD-X configuration was used         instead. That is in two-way mode with X-Band uplink and         coherent and simultaneous in X- and S-Band       Investigators and Other Key Personnel     =====================================     Martin Paetzold  University of Cologne  Principal Investigator;                                             solar physics       Bernd Hausler    Universitaet der       Experiment Manager                      Bundeswehr Munich       Richard Simpson  Stanford University    Data Manager;                                             surface scattering       Joerg Selle      Universitaet der       Operations Manager                      Bundeswehr Munich       Sami Asmar       Jet Propulsion         JPL/DSN operations                      Laboratory       G.

Many details of the subsystem are unknown; but they are       not of importance for understanding the science.  The       spacecraft 'build date' is taken to be 2003-06-01, shortly       before launch.

The high-gain antenna (HGA) was a body-fixed 1.60 m diameter         parabolic dish which allowed transmission and reception at         both S- and X-band. The HGA boresight was in the -X direction         of the spacecraft coordinate system, offset 5 degrees in the         +Z direction.  Its gain was 29.56 dB and 41.43 dB at S- and         X-band, respectively.  Two low-gain antennas (LGA) were         mounted on the front and rear of the spacecraft; they         operated only at S-band.  The HGA was the main antenna for         receiving telecommands from and transmitting telemetry         signals to the ground. The LGAs were used during the         commissioning phase after launch and for emergency         operations.           The Radio Frequency Distribution Unit (RFDU) switched the         onboard radio frequency hardware among the three antennas.           Switchable Traveling Wave Tube Amplifiers (TWTA) provided 60         watts of X-band transmitter power to the RFDU; their inputs         could come from either Transponder 1 or Transponder 2.  The         S-band transmitter power was 5 watts, which was generated         within the transponder units.           The S-band uplink was received via the LGA or HGA.  In the         coherent two-way mode the received frequency was used to         derive the downlink frequencies by using the constant         transponder ratios 880/221 and 240/221 for X-band and S-band         downlink, respectively.           The X-band uplink was received via the HGA only.  In the         coherent two-way mode the received frequency was used to         derive the downlink frequencies by using the constant         transponder ratios 880/749 and 240/749 for X-band and S-band         downlink, respectively.  An X-band uplink generally enhanced         the performance of the radio link because X-band is less         sensitive to the interplanetary plasma along the propagation         path.           The X-band and S-band frequencies were related by a factor of         11/3. If an uplink existed, the downlinks were also coherent         with the uplink by their respective transponding ratios.  The         dual-frequency downlink allowed separation of the classical         Doppler shift, due to relative motion of the spacecraft and         the ground station, from the dispersive media effects, due to         the propagation of the radio waves through the ionosphere and         interplanetary medium.           In one-way mode, the downlink transmitter frequency was         derived from an onboard Temperature Controlled Crystal         Oscillator (TCXO).  The one-way mode could be selected by         command from the ground.  If the spacecraft receiver could         not detect an uplink signal from the ground, the TCXO was         selected by default.  TCXO stability was several orders of         magnitude less than the uplink reference, so the one-way mode         was used only when no uplink was available (such as during         bistatic radar experiments, when the HGA was pointed toward         Mars) or when signal conditions were expected to be very         dynamic and the transponder might not be able to lock to the         uplink (such as during egress occultation observations).           The redundant transponders each consisted of an S-band and X-         band receiver and transmitter.  The spacecraft was capable of         receiving one uplink signal at S-band (2100 MHz) via the         LGAs, or at either X-band (7100 MHz) or S-band via the HGA.         The spacecraft could transmit a downlink signal at S-band         (2300 MHz) and (simultaneously) a downlink signal at X-band         (8400 MHz) using the HGA; or it could transmit one downlink         signal at S-band via the LGAs.           Operational Considerations       --------------------------         Radio science observations often required operation of the         spacecraft in orientations and configurations that were not         compatible with spacecraft constraints, telecommunications,         and requirements for other instruments.  There were also         limitations within the Radio Science Team, which resulted in         a prioritization of radio science observations.  The         following list is representative but not complete.             Spacecraft transmissions were very limited while in eclipse           to conserve battery power.  During the first occultation           season, no egress occultations were observed because those           were always in eclipse.             Spacecraft cooling panels could not be exposed to direct           sunlight. Since those were located on the side opposite the           HGA, no bistatic radar experiments could be conducted which           required pointing of the HGA more than about 90 degrees           from the Sun.             Bistatic radar experiments during the first half of 2004           were conducted only with fixed inertial pointing.  That is,           the HGA pointing was fixed in inertial space and the target           was allowed to drift through the beam.             Immediately after turn-on, output power from the S-band           transmitter was variable.  To ensure stability, a warm-up           period of about 60 minutes was scheduled before each use of           the S-band transmitter.             Solar observations had highest priority from 30 days before           solar conjunction to 30 days after.  Otherwise, radio           occultations had highest priority.  Bistatic radar           experiments had third priority; they required use of a 70-m           DSN antenna, so were difficult to schedule on short notice.             Gravity observations were most interesting when two-way           dual-frequency data could be collected as the spacecraft           passed through pericenter.  But pericenter time was highly           contested with several other instruments, which also sought           those opportunities to acquire surface data with the           highest resolution.             Phobos encounters were rare and were scheduled separately.           Competition among instruments for those times was extremely           fierce.         Calibration       -----------         For many experiments, calibration data were collected in         conjunction with the scientific observations.  For example,         carrier power and frequency could be determined before and/or         after bistatic radar and radio occultation experiments when         the antenna was pointed toward Earth.           The gain, beam patterns, and pointing of the HGA were         calibrated during post-launch tests.  The half-power points         were about 2.6 and 0.8 degrees from the boresight at S- and         X-band, respectively.           For radio tracking data, error sources in two-way mode are         shown below, where the tabulated error values are given in         terms of equivalent spacecraft velocity error.  These values         were based on pre-launch tests.                |======================================================|              |          Error Source          | Equivalent Velocity |              |                                |    Error (mm/s)     |              |                                |---------------------|              |                                |  S-band  |  X-Band  |              |================================+==========+==========|              |Total phase error (thermal and  |   1.0    |   0.3    |              |ground station contributions)   |          |          |              |--------------------------------+----------+----------|              |Transponder quantization error  |   0.4    |   0.1    |              |in frequency                    |          |          |              |--------------------------------+----------+----------|              |Transponder quantization error  |   0.01   |   0.004  |              |in phase                        |          |          |              |================================+==========+==========|              |Total error (coherent mode)     |   1.1    |   0.32   |              |======================================================|           Platform Mounting       -----------------         The MEX High Gain Antenna was rigidly attached to the -X side         of the spacecraft bus.  Therefore, the MEX HGA frame         (MEX_HGA) was defined as a fixed offset frame with its         orientation given relative to the MEX_SPACECRAFT frame:             +Z axis of the HGA frame was in the antenna boresight              direction (nominally 5 degrees off the spacecraft -X              axis toward the spacecraft +Z axis);           +Y axis of the HGA frame was in the direction of the              spacecraft +Y axis;           +X completed the right hand frame;             The origin of the HGA frame was located at the geometric           center of the HGA dish outer rim circle.                                         ^+Zhga                                       |                                       |                                       |                                 +Xhga |       +Yhga                                  _____o------->                                  \         /         .________________.     .__`._____.'__.     .________________.         |                 \    |             |    /                 |         |                  \   |     ___     |   /                  |         |                   |  |   .'   `  +Ysc |                   |         |                   |o=|   |  o------->o|                   |         |                   |  |    `_|+Zsc  |  |                   |         |                  /   |      |      |   \                  |         ._________________/    .______|______.    \_________________.          -Y Solar Array               |               +Y Solar Array                                       V +Xsc           Nominally a single rotation of -85 degrees about the +Y axis         was needed to align the spacecraft frame with the HGA frame.           Operating Modes       ---------------         A two-way dual-frequency radio link was used for         occultations, gravity observations, and solar corona         investigations.  Such a radio link benefited from the         superior frequency stability of the ground station.  The         dual-frequency downlink at X-band and S-band was used to         separate classical and dispersive Doppler shifts, allowing         correction of the observed frequency shift by any plasma         contribution.  For some observations (e.g., solar corona) an         S-band uplink was used to increase sensitivity to plasma         effects along the path.           In the above experiments, operation was usually preferred         with full power in the carrier (no telemetry or other         modulation on the downlink) to maximize signal-to-noise         ratio.           The dual-frequency one-way radio link at S- and X-band was         used for bistatic radar experiments.  In these experiments,         the HGA was pointed toward Mars and could not be used to         capture an uplink signal, receive commands, or transmit         telemetry.           The dual-frequency one-way radio link was also used for         egress occultation experiments because there was no time to         establish a two-way link.  Stability of the one-way link was         not sufficient to allow scientifically useful probing of the         neutral atmosphere on egress; but the ionospheric analysis         could be carried out using the differential phase/frequency         effects at S- and X-band which were proportional to each         other.         Instrument Specification - New Norcia     =====================================       ESA completed construction of a 35 m ground station at its       complex near New Norcia, Australia, in the year before launch       of Mars Express.  The station provided uplink at either S- or       X-band and simultaneous dual-frequency downlink at both bands.       Specifications are given below.  the 'build date' is taken       arbitrarily to be 1 January 2003.

urn:esa:psa:context:instrument:mex.omega,"OBSERVATOIRE MINERALOGIE, EAU, GLACES, ACTIVITE for MEX","OBSERVATOIRE MINERALOGIE, EAU, GLACES, ACTIVITE","     Instrument Overview   ===================     OMEGA is a mapping spectrometer working both in the visible and     the infrared spectral ranges.  It is made of two co-aligned     channels, one working in the 0.38 to 1.05 micrometers visible and     near infrared range (VNIR channel), the other in the 0.93 to 5.1     micrometers short wavelength infrared range (SWIR channel).  The     data products constitute three-dimensional (X,Y,lambda) image-     cubes, with two spatial and one spectral dimensions.  The VNIR     channel uses a bi- dimensional CCD detector, operated in a     pushbroom mode.  Its telescope acquires at once in its focal plane     one cross-track line corresponding to the entire 8.8 degrees FOV,     defined by an entrance slit; the second dimension of the image is     provided by the motion of the S/C.  Each line is spectrally     dispersed along the columns of the array, the slit being imaged     through a concave holographic grating. The SWIR channel operates     in the whiskbroom mode: each imaged pixel is acquired at once by     an IR telescope; a scanning mirror, in front of the telescope,     permits to acquire crosstrack swaths of 16 up to 128 pixels width,     for a maximum FOV of 8.8 degrees, thus matching the VNIR FOV,     while the S/C motion provides the second spatial dimension. The     imaged pixel is focused by the telescope on a slit, followed by a     collimator.  The beam is then split towards two separated     spectrometers, to acquire the IR spectrum of each resolved pixel     onto two InSb linear arrays of 128 spectels each, from 0.93 to     2.73 micrometers and from 2.55 to 5.1 micrometers respectively.     Each array is cooled down 70K by a dedicated cryocooler, while the     entire spectrometer is cooled down 190 K by a conductive link to a     passive radiator.  The typical IR integration time, defined by the     S/C ground track velocity and the spatial sampling chosen, is 5     msec.  The corresponding VNIR integration times are 100 to 800 ms,     depending on the swath width, thus the altitude.  With such     integration times, SNR > 100, over the entire spectral range, is     the specification.       OMEGA is made of two distinct units:       - a Camera unit (OMEGA-C) with the VNIR and SWIR spectrographs,       their associated electrical devices, and one electronics       assembly for the control of the camera.  All units are       integrated onto a common base plate; its mass is 23.8 kg.       - a Main Electronics module (OMEGA-ME), for the data processing       and the general management of the instrument; its mass is       5.1 kg.       VNIR spectrograph     -----------------       VNIR is made of two optical subsystems: a focusing telescope       with its focal plane on a slit, and a spectrometer, that spreads       the slit image in the spectral dimension.  It provides image       data in the spectral range 0.38 to 1.05 micrometers achieving a       maximum spatial sampling of 0.4 mrad and a maximum spectral       sampling of 50 Angstrom. A refractive telescope focuses the       image on a slit placed on the Rowland circle of an aberration       corrected concave holographic grating mirror.  This element       reflects and disperses the light on a CCD detector tangent to       the Rowland circle.  The detector used is the TH7863 frame       transfer CCD produced by Thomson.  The chosen grating mirror can       create a flat image onto the focal plane.  This property allows       to match very well the flat detector matrix to the grating,       without other optical components.  A CCD frame is then composed       of N rows each containing an image of the slit at a given       wavelength, and M columns each containing the spectrum of a       point along the slit. The bi-dimensional image of the surface is       obtained by the pushbroom technique, in which the spacecraft       movement along its orbit performs a scan of the slit across the       planetary surface.  The electrical signal from the detector is       amplified and then digitized by a fast 12 bit A/D converter;       after conversion, all data are processed within       the OMEGA-ME.         In order to decrease the detector noise, VNIR is cooled down 190       K by conduction to the SWIR mechanical unit.  The choice of       refractive over reflective optics was made because of the large       (8.8 degrees) field of view requirement.  The telescope has a 6       elements objective similar to that of a modern commercial       photographic camera.  The shape of the elements and the types of       optical glass were chosen to obtain the best chromatic       aberration corrections over the entire spectral range.  The last       element serves as a field lens which matches the entire       objective with the grating to avoid light losses. To avoid       stress in the lenses at the working temperature, the two       doublets are not cemented.  The two glasses, FK54 and fused       silica, have very different expansion coefficients of 8 and 0.55       x 10E-6/K at room temperature.  The entrance aperture of 15.6 mm       is defined by a diaphragm between the two doublets.         An aberration corrected concave holographic grating is placed 142.7       mm from the entrance slit (which is in the focal plane of the       telescope).  The grating is tilted to form the spectrum at an       angle of roughly 6 degrees from the optical axis.  This angle       does not allow CCD insertion near the entrance without beam       obscuration; therefore, a folding mirror deflects the beam       toward the side of the assembly, where the CCD can be mounted       with ample clearance.  The zero order spectrum, at 4.5 degrees       from the folded optical axis (lying in the y-z plane) is       directed into a light trap to prevent degradation of the image.       The first order spectrum ranges in angle from 6 degrees at       lambda = 0.35 micrometers to 10 degrees for lambda = 1.05       micrometers.  The second and higher order spectra can, in       principle, also degrade the data. Its contribution depends both       on the grating efficiency, and the spectral distribution of the       incident radiation.  For this reason, a dedicated filter is       mounted, in front of the detector.  The concave, spherical,       holographic grating in a Rowland mounting - where the entrance       slit and the spectrum are on radii of curvature of the grating -       makes the spectrometer compact, light, and simple.  In fact, no       collimator or camera lens is required and the spectrometer has       only one element. Moreover, the focal plane image can be flat,       to match the planar CCD sensors. Since the concave holographic       grating is obtained by recording a perfect optical pattern with       groove spacing absolutely constant, it has no ghosts. Stray       light has also a much lower level than the best ruled gratings.       Therefore, concave holographic gratings generally have a much       higher signal to noise ratio than classically ruled gratings.         The optical performances have been computed by ray tracing.  In       the focal plane the spot diagram is about the pixel size (23x23       microns). For off-axis propagation (4.4 degrees off-axis), the       total spot size is about 2 pixels in the sagittal direction.       More precisely, on axis and at 0.7 micrometers, 98.8 % of the       energy falls within a 23x23 micron pixel; at 4.4 degrees off-       axis and lambda = 0.4 micrometers, 74 % of the energy falls       within a CCD element.  When the light propagates off-axis, the       spot size is smaller for the shorter wavelengths.         The Pattern Generator (PG) determines the CCD integration time,       and generates the timing signals necessary to transfer an image       from the light sensitive area to the masked zone and then to the       output shift register of the CCD.  The output of the CCD is then       amplified and converted by a fast 12 bit A/D converter under       control of the PG. The timing of the instrument imposes a       relatively high frequency for CCD operation.  In fact, depending       on the distance from the planet and hence on the spacecraft       speed, the time TR between consecutive frames can be chosen as:       100, 200, 400 or 800 ms.  During the TR period the integration,       readout and data transmission processes must occur.  To save       time, integration and transmission of the previous frame are       overlapped.  Because the maximum data value which can be       transmitted during TR is limited to 12288 bytes, it is not       possible to read the total frame of 384x288 pixels,       corresponding to 110592 bytes.  We are forced to read only a       sub-frame, or to reduce the number of pixels by summing them on       chip.  The combination of different scientific requirements,       integration times and hardware limitations led us to the       definition of 40 operation modes, which can be selected through       commands sent to the spacecraft, ranging from the nominal       (spatial x spectral) mode (128x96 with summation of 3x3 pixels),       to the high spectral resolution mode (64x144), to the high speed       mode (16x96).  Summation along columns and rows will decrease       the spatial and spectral resolution, but increases signal-to-       noise ratio considerably.  The implementation of mode 16x74 is       the most critical due to the short time available to complete       all the operations (TR = 100 ms).  For this reason the Pattern       Generator provides two values for the pixel readout frequency: f       slow= 500 kHz when the pixel voltage has to be digitized and       ffast = 4 MHz when the pixel is simply read from the CCD output       register without any digital conversion.       SWIR Spectrograph     -----------------       The IR channel is constituted of a telescope and its fore-       optics, a beam splitter and two spectrometers, each with its       detector array actively cooled.  The telescope is a Cassegrain       type one with a 200 mm focal length, a f/4 aperture, leading to       a 1.2 mrad (4.1 arcmin) IFOV, and a 15 arcmin free field of view       (including the positioning tolerances).  The distance between       the primary and the secondary mirrors is 51 mm; that between the       secondary mirror and the image plane is 82 mm.  In front of the       telescope, a fore-optics system has the primary goal of       providing a cross-track scanning of the IFOV.  It includes two       mirrors, a moving and a fixed one.  The total scanning angle is       +/- 4.4 degrees (FOV = 128 IFOV), and is adjusted to the OMEGA       viewing direction.  The control of the scanning mechanism is       performed by a dedicated FPGA-based electronic sub- system.         Focused by the telescope on an entrance slit, through a shutter,       the beam is first collimated, then separated, by a dichroic       filter with its cut-off wavelength at 2.7 micrometres towards       two spectrometers, operating in the following spectral ranges:       0.93 to 2.73 micrometers and 2.55 to 5.1 micrometers.  Each       spectrometer includes a blazed grating working at its first       order, and an optical reflective system, then a field mirror and       a refractive refocusing system which gives a large aperture on       the detection block (f/1.6): it images the spectrum onto a 128       elements InSb linear array, cooled down a temperature of < 80K,       and multiplexed by a charge transfer device.  Sets of filters       are implemented in front of the detector to reject the       contribution of other orders from the grating.         The InSb photodiodes have been manufactured by SAT.  The       dimensions       of each photosensitive element is 90 micron x       120 micron, with a pitch of 120 micron.  All elements of the       focal planes are hybridized on a ceramic with two electric       circuit layers to connect the elements together.  The ceramic is       glued on a titanium base plate and covered with a titanium       closure, which includes the filters.  An internal calibration       source is implemented, to control potential shifts of the       overall spectrometer transmission, and to calibrate the relative       response of each pixel.  It is made of a tungsten lamp, operated       as a black body which can be power heated at different       temperatures.  The calibration beam is reflected towards the       spectrometer by diffusion on the back side of the entrance slit.         SWIR requires an accurate thermal control, at three levels:           - the IR detectors must be cooled down a temperature of < 80 K,           controlled with an accuracy better than 0.1K.  This is done by           connecting them (copper heat link) to two cryocoolers, one for           each array: they consist of Inframetrics 13000 series integral           Stirling cycle coolers.  Their guaranteed lifetimes are > 2500           hours.  They are controlled by dedicated electronics;           - the spectrometer must be cooled down to 190 K, in order both to           allow the detectors to reach their required operational           temperature (< 80 K), and to minimize the thermal background.           This is achieved by conductive coupling (heat pipes) to a 'low           temperature' radiator, provided by the S/C;           - the electronics and the cryocoolers heads must be coupled           (copper links) to a 'high temperature' (280 K) radiator to           dissipate their energy.       OMEGA-ME Unit     -------------       The OMEGA main electronics is designed to power and control the       instrument, to acquire and compress all scientific data on line,       and to interface with the S/C telecommand/telemetry system.  The       entire system is cold redundant.  Within OMEGA-ME, the Command       and Data Processing Unit(CDPU) has the following tasks:         - acquisition of all scientific data from VNIR and SWIR;       - formatting for real time data compression       - wavelet based data compression, followed by formatting of         processed data       - reception and formatting of HK data       - forward all data to the S/C telemetry system         The CDPU is based on a TSC21020 Temic processor, and integrated,       together with a 6Mbyte SRAM, into a 3D packaged highly       miniaturized cube, inherited from a CIVA/Rosetta development.

urn:esa:psa:context:instrument:mex.pfs,PLANETARY FOURIER SPECTROMETER for MEX,PLANETARY FOURIER SPECTROMETER," 1.Introduction ==============   PFS is a double pendulum interferometer working in two wavelength ranges (1.2- 5um and 5-45um, Table 1). Martian radiation is divided into two beams by a dichroic mirror. The two ranges correspond to two planes (one on top of the other) containing the two interferometers, so that the same motor can simultaneously move the two pendulums and the two channels are sampled simultaneously and independently. The pendulum motion is accurately controlled via a laser diode reference channel using the same optics as the martian radiation. The same laser diode also generates the sampling signal for the analogue- digital converter (ADC), measuring the 600 nm displacements of the double pendulum mirror. The measurements are double-sided interferograms, so that the onboard FFT can be computed without needing the zero optical path difference location.

The flight hardware was built in Italy (the Interferometer Block with its controlling electronics, the digital electronics controlling the experiment, and the Ground Support Equipment with the spacecraft simulator) and Poland (power supply and pointing system). Special flight parts and subassemblies were built in Russia and Germany.   1.2.Technical description =========================   The flight hardware, totaling 31.2 kg, is divided into four modules, with connecting cables (0.8 kg): -Module-O (PFS-O): the interferometer, with its optics and proximity  electronics, is the core of PFS. 21.5 kg; -Module-S (PFS-S): the pointing device, which allows PFS to receive  radiation from Mars or from the inflight calibration sources, 3.7 kg -Module-E (PFS-E): the digital electronics, including a 32-Mbit mass  memory and a realtime FFT. 3.0 kg; -Module-P(PFS-P): the power supply, with the DC/DC converter,  redundancies and the separate power supplies for the 16-bit  ADCs. 2.2 kg.   Power requirements are: - 5 Watt thermal control -10 Watt in sleep mode -35 Watt full operational mode -44 Wpeak.   1.3.Module-O (PFS-O) ====================   The incident IR beam falls onto the entrance filter that separates the radiation of the SW channel from that of the LW channel and directs each into the appropriate interferometer channel. The PFS-S in front of the interferometer allows the FOV to be pointed along and across the projection of the flight path onto the martian surface. It also directs the FOV at the internal blackbody sources diffusers and to open space for inflight calibration. Each PFS channel is equipped with a pair of retroreflectors attached by brackets to an axle rotated by a torque motor. The axle and drive mechanism are used for both channels, which are vertically separated. The optical path difference is generated by the rotation of the retroreflectors. The motor controller uses the outputs of two reference channels, which are equipped with laser diodes. This interferometer design is very robust against misalignment in a harsh environment, in comparison with the classical Michelson-type interferometer. The detectors are in the centre of the parabolic mirrors. The optical path is changed by rotating the shaft of the double pendulum along its axis. In this way, the optical path is four times that provided by a single cube-corner displacement because two mirrors move at the same time. The dichroic mirror acts as a fork that divides the two spectral ranges. Indeed, it reflects all the wavelengths below 5um and remains more or less transparent for longer wavelengths. The band stop for wavelengths below 1.2um is provided by the silicon window, with its cutoff at 1.24um and placed in the optical inlet of the SW channel. This filter is tilted by 1.5 deg. so that the radiation returning to the source is not partially reflected on the detector. The double- pendulum axis is rotated by a brushless, frictionless motor (two for redundancy). The shaft of the double pendulum is held only by two preloaded ball bearings so additional mechanical friction is required for stabilizing the pendulum speed. Double-sided interferograms are acquired by placing the zero optical path difference in the centre of the mirror displacement. A double-sided interferogram has several advantages, including a relative insensitivity to phase errors. Bilateral operation is adopted in order to reduce the time-cycle of each measurement, but separate calibration for each direction is recommended in order to maintain the radiometric accuracy. The spectral reference beam is a diode laser (InGaAsPat 1.2um); its detector is an IR photodiode with maximum response at about 1.2um. The beam of the reference channel is processed like the input signal so that its optical path coincides with that of the signal being studied. Each channel has its own reference beam and the different lengths of the double-pendulum arms are fully compensated for. Because the LW beam splitter is not transparent at the wavelength of the corresponding reference diode laser, a special small window was added in order to keep the attenuation of the laser beams negligible through the beam splitter itself. The unused output beams of the two reference channels terminate into optical traps.   1.3.1.Optical scheme of PFS-O =============================   The incident IR beam falls onto the entrance filter that separates the radiation of the SW channel  from that of the LW channel and directs each into the appropriate interferometer channel. The PFS-S in front of the interferometer allows the FOV to be pointed along and across the projection of the flight path onto the martian surface.

Because the LW beam splitter is not transparent at the wavelength of the corresponding reference diode laser, a special small window was added in order to keep the attenuation of the laser beams negligible through the beam splitter itself. The unused output beams of the two reference channels terminate into optical traps.     1.3.2.Electronics of PFS-O ==========================   Most of the electronics inside PFS-O are analogue but the microprocessor-based On- Board Data Management (OBDM) board controls all the complex procedures during acquisition of the interferogram, including communication with PFS-E. It includes 32 kb word of EPROM for software storage and 96 kb word for data. The most important electronics block is the speed controller. The zero crossing of an interferogram of a monochromatic source that is very stable in wavelength can be used for sampling the interferogram of the source under study. Ideally, the interferogram of the monochromatic source should be a pure sine wave but it is not simply because its interferogram is limited in time. The shorter the wavelength of the reference source means better sampling accuracy. For PFS, 1.2um is the reference source because of the limited variety of diode lasers and it simplifies the optical design. The wavelength of a diode laser depends on its temperature and power, so great care has to be taken in their control. The speed of the double pendulum is such that a frequency of 2  kHz is generated for the SW channel, so a train of 4 kHz pulses is produced from the electronics of the SW reference channel. Thermal control is also very important for an IR interferometer; heaters and thermometers are positioned at eight locations. A locking system blocks the double pendulum during launch and maneuvering for orbital insertion and correction. The procedure of locking and unlocking takes a minimum of 3 minutes but using a paraffin actuator means it can be repeated hundreds of times. The launch acceleration vector will be along the axis of the double pendulum for maximum robustness. The photoconductor SW channel detector can work at temperatures down to 200K. It is passively cooled through a radiator and its holder is partially insulated from the rest of the IB. For the LW channel, the pyroelectric detector can operate without performance degradation even at ambient temperatures.   1.4.Module-E (PFS-E) ====================   PFS-E controls all the PFS modules: the communications to and from the spacecraft, memorizing and executing the command words, and operating PFS and sending back the data words to the spacecraft. Moreover, it synchronizes all the procedures according to the time schedule and to the clock time from the spacecraft.   1.5.Module-P (PFS-P) ====================   PFS combines many kinds of electrical energy consumers: standard digital and analogue electronics, sensitive preamplifiers and ADCs, light sources and electromechanical devices (motors and relays). All of them have different supply requirements and some need to be electrically isolated (to ensure extremely high stability) and/or individually controlled by Module E's processor. This is why PFS-P is more complicated than a simple DC/DC converter: there are three independent converters, six different power outputs (totaling 13 independent voltages), one common input interface to satellite and one interface to DAM. All converters have cold redundancy. Switching between main/reserve +5 Volt is controlled by the spacecraft, while the other main/reserve converters are controlled by PFS itself.   1.6.Module-S (PFS-S) ====================   The previous version of the pointing system, for the Mars-96 mission, had two degrees-of-freedom in pointing (two rotation axes), but was rather heavy (8.5 kg for the system and 2.3 kg for the controlling electronics). The pointing system is certainly necessary for generating a complete set of measurements, since we need to measure not only the martian radiation but also the calibration blackbody and empty space. Mars Express provides nadir pointing so PFS itself needs only one degree of rotation, simplifying the PFS-S design and reducing mass considerably (to 3.7 kg).   1.7.Modes of operation, data-acquisition cycle ==============================================   PFS-S and PFS-O work in parallel during an observation session, while PFS-E coordinates operations of the other modules by sending commands and receiving messages. During measurements, PFS-S must be motionless while PFS-O acquires data. This is the only synchronization point in the data-acquisition cycle. Upon completion of acquisition, all the modules work asynchronously while PFS-E coordinates their operations: -starts rotation of PFS-S; -receives LW and SW interferograms from PFS-O; -if spectra are required, PFS uploads previously acquired LW and SW  interferograms into the Fast Fourier Transform processor and  downloads computed spectra; -prepares the telemetry data pack i.e. splits information into frames  and stores them in the mass memory; -upon completion of the PFS-S rotation gives a command to PFS-O to  start new acquisition.   After each data-acquisition cycle, PFS checks whether new telecommands have been received and, if any, executes them. Telemetry can be sent at any time on request from the spacecraft.   1.8.Inflight calibration ========================   During observation sessions, PFS periodically performs calibrations by sending commands to PFS-S to point sequentially at the calibration sources: deep space, internal blackbody and calibration lamp. The housekeeping information obtained from PFS-O after each calibration measurement contains, in particular, the temperatures of the sensors and the blackbody. These data are used for the computation of the absolute spectra for the LW channel.     2.Data-taking Along the Orbit =============================   2.1.Data-transmission modes ===========================   The data-transmission mode (DTM) defines the kind of scientific data that PFS must select and store in the mass memory to be sent to Earth. PFS has 15 DTMs, numbered for historical reasons, 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 17, 18, 27, 28, 9, 10, 15, 16. DTM0 is for PFS operating in the autonomous test mode; the others are obtained in the science mode, where PFS acquires both LW and SW interferograms. If spectra are required (DTM 9, 10, 15, 16), PFS makes Fast Fourier Transforms of the interferograms. Then, depending on the DTM, PFS selects the required data. Interferograms can be selected completely or partially. Of the 15 DTMs, 10 provide interferograms and four spectra:   -MODE 0: autotest of the interferometer (4096 points in the LW          channel and 16384 points in the SW channel provide the sine          wave shape and the monitoring of the speed during the double          pendulum motion); -MODE 2: full LW interferograms; -MODE 4: half-resolution interferograms, SW and LW; -MODE 5: half-resolution LW interferograms; -MODE 6: half-resolution SW interferograms; -MODE 7: full LW interferogram + one-sided SW interferogram (          including the zero optical path difference and right          side); -MODE 8: one-sided LW and SW interferograms (right side); -MODE 17: full LW and SW interferograms; -MODE 18: full SW interferograms; -MODE 27: full LW interferogram + one-sided SW interferogram           (including the zero optical path difference and left side); -MODE 28: one-sided LW and SW interferograms (left side); -MODE 9: modules of LW and SW spectra; -MODE 10: modules of LW spectra; -MODE 15: full modules of LW spectra and SW spectra with reduced           range(2000 points in the SW channel between 2000 and 4000            cm-1); -MODE 16: modules of SW spectra (6144 points).   2.2.Data-taking along the orbit ===============================   PFS will perform measurement when the spacecraft is below 4000km. PFS will wake up from its sleep mode about 1h before and follow the scheme: -apocentre: PFS is in sleep mode, telecommands can be received; -pericentre minus 60min: wake-up, wait for warm-up, start autonomous  test, calibration LW, calibration SW, calibration deep space. PFS-S  in nadir direction. Give data to the spacecraft; -pericentre minus 40min: start martian observations. Give data to the  spacecraft; -pericentre plus 48min: stop martian observations. Give data to the  spacecraft; -pericentre plus 53min: calibration LW, calibration SW, calibration  deep space, autonomous test. Give data to the spacecraft. Go into  sleep mode; -up to apocentre in sleep mode.   In total, 600 measurements per orbit are taken, of which 60 are calibrations. This corresponds to 1200 measurements per day (the third orbit per day being for downlink) and 823440 spectra in a martian year. The footprint from 4000km is of the order of 109km for the SW channel and 188km for the LW channel; at pericentre (250km) they become respectively 6.8km and 11.8km (perpendicular to the ground track, but 20km along it).

In addition, there is an opening for Solar viewing. This Solar     aperture is NOT on the S/C Nadir face.       The Sensor Unit has two mechanisms, one which move On and Off a slit     in the UV channel, the other which moves a shutter on the Solar     aperture. Spicam mechanisms are fully autonomous and no separate     commands are needed for mechanism operations. Each mechanism has two     statuses, ON and OFF for slit, OPEN and CLOSED for shutter.       The UV channel is a spectrometer with an optical baffle, an off     axis parabolic mirror, a slit with two positions, a grating and a     detector which an intensified CCD. On the CCD, the rows which are     parallel to the unit baseplate, are the spectral dimension.       The IR channel is made of an entrance lens, an AOTF and two single     pixels detectors (for each polarisation). As the AOTF acts as a     filter, the IR spectrum is obtained by electrically scanning the     AOTF frequency. All the channels have their own digital     electronics which performs all operations at detector level and     digitizes the data, then waiting for transmission to the DPU     through a RS422 link at 937 kbits/s.       The DPU main functions are:         electrical interfaces with S/C         send commands and get data from the subunits         formatting data before transmission to S/C       The DPU has the general control of the instrument. It sends commands     to the sub units and retrieves data. Then it formats and produces     telemetry packets. Servitudes refers to non-detector elements of     Sensor Unit.     The polling of the sub units is done by the DPU, at a rate defined     in the Telecommand.     Depending on the operating mode, The IR channel is switched ON or     not.       Physical configuration:   =======================     The Sensor Unit has two main directions of sight, one is Nadir ( s/c     +Z), the other is 'behind' Solar panel, -Y side.       The Sensor Unit has two openings for Nadir viewing, one for UV     channel, the other for IR channel located on the Nadir face of S/C.     The instrument optical axis is parallel to the baseplate and     perpendicular to the Nadir face of the spacecraft.       The Sensor Unit has three apertures:      - Main UV aperture on Nadir face.      - IR aperture on Nadir face.      - Secondary UV and IR aperture for Sun viewing             internal mirrors and fibre bent the Solar light in the             instrument main optical axis       In addition, there is an opening for Solar viewing. This Solar     aperture is not on the S/C Nadir face. The Solar viewing opening     opening is built in the base plate of the Sensor Unit. This opening     will have to be oriented towards the Sun prior to each solar     occultation observation. This opening can be closed by a mechanical     shutter.

A hole in the instrument mounting wall and in the     -Y wall will be used for Solar occultation.

It seems that Spicam is quite demanding concerning S/C     manoeuvers and resources availability. We examine resources needed     by Spicam: - Manoeuver duration: is dependent on orbit parameters,     actual Spacecraft attitude and desired inertial direction     (selected objective) and will computed. It may be that total     manoeuver duration during one orbit may be in conflict with Earth     attitude needed for data transmission. However we note that there     are 2 orbits (of 3) per day without transmission to earth. - Other     resources as wheel usage and power: Wheel usage is a resource to     be shared between instruments. Nadir pointing is more wheel     consuming than fixed inertial attitude. Power is not a concern for     Sun occultation (it drops to 0 anyway). For Star occultation, the     angle around +Z axis is a free parameter and therefore can be     adjusted for maximum power collection if necessary.       In the Inertial mode, pointing direction is any inertial (relative     to stars) direction. This direction must be kept fixed during     observation duration of 2 to 8 mn. It is defined as any star     direction which may be occulted by Mars in dark side of Planet.     (see operational modes for details) In nadir mode, nominal nadir     pointing (as other instruments) in bright side of Planet.

The CCD detector head is mounted in such a way that the columns     are perpendicular to the baseplate of the Sensor Unit. The rows     direction is the spectral dimension.       The UV detector records a window of 5 rows allowing to have at the     same time, in Star mode, the Star spectrum surrounded by the     background spectra.

When the AOTF is powered (at a certain frequency), it selects     a wavelength which goes up to the detectors. A full spectrum is then     obtained by scanning the frequencies.

urn:esa:psa:context:instrument:rl.apxs,Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer for RL,Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer,"                                                                   Instrument Overview                             ===================                             The Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer (APXS) is an instrument        that will provide information on the elemental composition of        the comet surface. The instrument is based on the interaction        of alpha particles and x-rays with matter. It operates in two        modes: the alpha mode (Rutherford backscattering) and the        x-ray mode for alpha-particle and x-ray induced x-ray        spectroscopy. The APXS combines these methods in one single        instrument while being low in mass and power consumption.       Historically, there was also a proton mode that has been        omitted in the new design in favor of an advanced x-ray mode.       The acronym APXS stands for the old and new design. Using        the x-ray mode, the Rosetta APXS is able to determine in-situ        concentrations of elements from sodium to strontium at levels        down to several hundred ppm. Light elements such as carbon,        nitrogen and oxygen can be detected using the alpha mode,        usually with sensitivity of 1 atom %. In addition, most of the       elements are determined by both modes, albeit with different        efficiency and accuracy. Hydrogen(and helium) cannot be        measured at all by nature of the methods, although, water can       still be inferred from any excess of oxygen (which APXS        determines accurately) over what is required from the overall       stoichiometry (assuming no other light elements in the        sample). The Rosetta APXS consists of a sensor head, a        deployment device and electronics. The sensor head contains        Curium-244 alpha sources (with an activity of about 40 mCi at        integration time and with a half-life of 18.11 years) that        bombard the sample with alpha particles of an energy of about       5.5MeV and x-rays of about 14 to 21 keV (emitted by the        Plutonium-240 daughter). The back-scattered alpha particles        are measured by six alpha detectors and the x-ray radiation by       one high-resolution x-ray detector (energy resolution,        measured as full width at half maximum (FWHM), is 180 eV at        6.4 keV at temperatures below -40degC).                                                                                             Scientific Objectives                             =====================                             The goal of the Rosetta APXS experiment is to determine the        chemical composition of the cometary surface at the landing        site and its potential alteration with time due to increase        activity when the comet approaches the Sun. The data obtained        will be used to characterize the surface of the comet, to        obtain the gas/dust ratio, determine the chemical composition        of the dust component, and to compare the dust with the        composition of known meteorite types. These results will be        brought into context with other measurements made on the        lander and the orbiter to fully obtain a more complete picture       of the present state of the comet, and to get insight into its       evolution and origin.                                                                                                  Calibration                                 ===========                                 In the laboratory, the instrument was calibrated in vacuum        measuring a geological sample, called SSK-1 (already used for        the MPF (Mars Pathfinder Rover Sojourner) and MER (Mars        Exploration Rover) APXS) with known composition in a standard        geometry (distance between sample surface and detector). The        data from this sample are used to compare the performance and       sensitivity of the Rosetta APXS with MPF APXS and MER APXS.        This cross calibration mainly determines the energy scale, the       detector efficiency and the quality of the alpha and the x-ray        spectra ( endpoint sharpness in the alpha mode and FWHM of the        x-ray lines in the x-ray mode). Using these instrument        specific properties, the calibration of the Rosetta APXS can        be achieved using the extensive MER calibration and future new       calibration measurements tailored to cometary samples.                                                                                     Operational Considerations                          ==========================        The APXS can store the current XRAM content if it is        continuously powered with 5V on the KAL line. When it is        powered OFF, the content gets lost and is restored with the        PROM default values after the next power ON.       Please note that after power ON, those values have to be        uploaded if values different from the default ones need to be       used. That is necessary for example in the case of changing        the threshold in order to obtain response for low energies and       in the case of the safe LG parameter to operate the deployment        of the deployment device.       Due to problems observed in previous payload checkouts and for        security, the command for downloading the relevant spectra        will be sent twice. In that way we assure that even in the        case we may have some error with the download of the spectra,        the probability of losing important science will be        substantially reduced                                                Detectors                                   =========                                   Silicon drift detector for x-ray detection.       6 alpha solid state silicon detectors.                                                                                   Electronics                                 ===========                                 Details on the electronics of the instrument are described in        the APXS ADP.

To bring the        APXS in contact with the comet surface, it is moved by the       deployment device that can lower and raise the sensor head by        a command.

CIVA-P is a panoramic stereo camera, while CIVA-M is         an optical microscope coupled to a near infrared microscopic         hyperspectral imager                                                        Scientific Objectives                                            =====================                                                    stereoscopic imaging of the site surrounding the Lander         (CIVA-P), and by optical imaging and infrared spectral imaging         of surface and subsurface samples of the cometary nucleus, at         a microscopic scale (CIVA-M)                                                                                                                   Calibration                                                             ===========                                                             Following calibration functions are applied to the CIVA-P         images, at IAS level:      Non-linearity correction                 The TH7888A detector presents a strong deviation   from linearity when the signal is higher than ~ 80%   of the saturation level. This saturation level depends   on the camera, on the gain setting and on the   temperature of the detector. A linearity correction   transformation which includes the subtraction of the offest   has therefore been applied to level 1 CIVA images which   reach levels close to saturation (CIVA 1, CIVA 2, CIVA 3   and CIVA4). The linearity files providing the actual DN level   from the measured DN level (1024 floating point values)   are civa1scale.txt, civa2scale.txt, civa3scale.txt,   civa4scale.txt. The offset was evaluated as 18.4 DN, 19 DN,   13 DN and 20.9 DN for these four cameras.      Cameras CIVA 5, CIVA 6 and CIVA 7 have low DN values,   hence the corrected values correspond to the subtraction   of an offset of 17.8 DN, 20.5 DN and 14.5 DN for CIVA 5,   CIVA 6 and CIVA 7 respectively.      Regions of images from the CIVA 1, CIVA 2, CIVA 3 and CIVA 4   cameras are saturated. This situation is indicated in   the image file by a value of the recovered DN equal to   the maximum floating value of the transformation table   provided in 'civaNscale.txt' (N=1 to 4).                                                                                                    Operational Considerations                                              ==========================                                              CIVA-P will be operated to take one stereo image of the Orbiter         jus after release of Philae, to be used as calibration for the         on-comet images. Then, immediately after touch-down, a full         panorama of the landing site, with a partial stereoscopic         coverage, will be taken by CIVA-P, and immediately transmitted         to the Earth for quick look data reduction. This first panorama         will be key to assess the landing conditions, and to declare         secure the planned Philae sequence of operations. Follow-ons         partial or global panoramas could be acquired either to monitor         changes with solar illumination and/or cometary activity, to         increase the stereoscopic coverage, and to image after their         deployment Philae systems and sensors.             CIVA-M will be turned on after all samplings (surface and         subsurface) by SD2. It will consist in sequences of calibration         (by imaging an oven with a calibration target), imaging of ovens         prior to be filled, and after being filled by SD2 with cometary         samples. CIVA-M/V will image each oven in three colors, while         CIVA-M/I will acquire a complete 3D (x,y,lambda) image cube of         them. After compression and storage in the IME mass memory, the         data will be transferred to CDMS for downlink.                                                                                  Electronics                                                             ===========                                                             This Imaging Main Electronics (IME) is a facility, developed          under the co-responsibility of IWP/DLR and IAS, for both ROLIS         and CIVA: they share a common I/F with the Lander, for both the         power subsystem and the Central Data Management System (CDMS).         Thus the IME includes the CIVA-Central Electronics (CIVA-CE),         mainly based on a dedicated CDPU (Command and Data Processing         Unit); it is equipped with a 16 Mbytes mass memory.         The CIVA-CDPU (Command and Data Processing Unit), developed by         IAS, has the following functions: on/off power control; camera         program uploading; camera heads check out; command reception          (from ROLIS-DPU) and management; CIVA payload sequencing;          status monitoring; image acquisition; integration time         optimization; image compression (using wavelet based software);         error encoding and data formatting. It consists of a TEMIC         TSC21020 processor, 2 Kword PROMs for boot sequence, 512 Kbyte         EEPROM for application program and parameters storage, 128         KWord Fast SRAM for application program, 128 KWord Fast SRAM for         application data and 6 Mbyte SRAM for 2 images data (1024x1024         pixels) storage/processing. The CDPU electronics is integrated         into a 3D-packaged cube which is implemented into the IME.         The CIVA-CE includes two more electrical boards:         one is dedicated to the IR detector, and the second to the CIVA         peripherics.            Location                                                                ========                                                                CIVA-P is constituted of 7 identical miniaturized cameras,          implemented as 5 single cameras and one stereoscopic pair of         two co-aligned ones, thus filling the 360 deg. panoramic field         of view by six contiguous and overlapping FOV of 70 deg. each,         60 deg. apart one from the next.         CIVA-M is constituted of a visible microscope, CIVA-M/V and a         near infrared hyperspectral imager CIVA-M/I. CIVA-M/V and CIVA-M/I         are mounted on the Philae base-plate         (balcony), close to the drill and sample distribution system         (SD2). They will image and analyse the samples (from a distance         of 13.0 mm) whenever they will be deposited within containers         (Mid Temperature Ovens), mounted on a rotating carousel, and         closed by a sapphire window transparent in both the Visible and         the near IR.

CIVA will analyse cometary material from micron size particles         to meter size features: 7 micrometres to a few mm with the         microscope, 1 mm to meters with the panoramic cameras.

It works as a time domain                 transponder between one module landed on the comet surface                    (Lander) and another flying around the comet (Orbiter).                        The CONSERT signal consists in a 90 MHz sinusoidal waveform          which is phase modulated by a pseudorandom code or PSK (phase shift          keying) coding. Such frequency,          in the radio range, is expected to minimize the losses during the              propagation inside the comet material and the generated pulse code             maximizes the signal to noise ratio.                                           In these experimental conditions CONSERT will perform a            measurement of the mean dielectric properties and on the detection of          large size embedded structures or small irregularities within the              comet nucleus.                                                                                                                                                CALIBRATION                                                                    ===========                                                                                                                                                   Due to the design of the instrument, there is no special calibration operation          mode. The science data are composed of the signal characterising the           propagation channel of the comet nucleus as a function of time:               - The propagation time is the main data to be inverted and its                   accuracy is waranted by the Consert clock absolute accuracy and                 stability.                                                                   - The signal amplitude can also provide information about the                    nucleus structure but there is no internal calibration channel                 to increase the link budget accuracy.                                                                                                                       OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS                                                     ==========================                                                                                                                                    The Lander makes a coherent addition and a detection of the position (delay)          of the correlation principal peak. A clean coded signal is finally back          emitted to the Orbiter with the found delay. The orbiter accumulates the          received signal and sends it to the Earth (via the satellite interface).                                                                                        OPERATIONAL MODES                                                              =================                                                                                                                                             Each scientific measurement sequence (called scanning sequence)                involves the Orbiter part and the Lander. The duration of this scan            sequence is related to the duration of the orbit of the Rosetta                spacecraft relatively to the Lander on the rotating comet nucleus.             This duration is typically of the order of 10 hours during one revolution          around the nucleus. The individual duration of each sounding is less than one         second.                                                                                                                                                       This duration of scanning sequence  should                                     correspond to the time when the Lander and the Orbiter are separated           by the comet. During the direct line of sight periods, where Philae and         Rosetta are in visibility of each others, the synchronization occurs. This         mandatory and preliminary phase is also called the CONSERT 'tuning'.         This means that the duration of the data               recording does not correspond to the total time of one revolution, but         only for the part where Philae and Rosetta are in occultation by the comet         nucleus.             The number of samples which theoretically should be taken is given by the          following formula:                       2 * pi * radius of comet / ( lambda / 2 )          where lambda is wavelength.                                                    During the scanning sequence for a hypothetical circular comet with a 750 m          radius, about 3000 individual measurements, called soundings should be               taken.                                                                                                                                                        The general structure of the Consert operational scenario does not             depend on the comet type that is explored during the Rosetta                   mission, however  a certain amount of the parameters depends on the               shape and size of the comet nucleus and on the orbit of the                    spacecraft and nucleus rotation.                                                                                                                                                                                                             MEASURED PARAMETERS                                                            ===================                                                                                                                                           While acquiring the signal which propagates through the comet         nucleus, the CONSERT intrument measures the following physical         parameters:            - Propagation time of one to three peaks (in case of               multi-path propagation).            - Attenuation of these signal peaks along the propagation              channel.

It consists of a          Penetrator (PEN) which is equipped with 16 thermal sensors, the         infrared radiometer (TM), and thermal (ANC-T) and accelerometer         sensors /ANC-M) located in the Philae harpoons.                                                                                                                                              Scientific Objectives                                      =====================                                       The scientific goals of MUPUS are:           - to determine the energy balance of the comets surface and              its variation with time and depth           - to determine the thermal conductivity of the comet down to             a depth of 32 cm           - to determine the thermal inertia of the surface           - to determine the strength of the cometary surface layers                                                                                                                                        Calibration                                              ===========                                          Due to problems with the ground calibration the PEN sensors          were re-calibrated in flight by comparison with a h/k Pt-100         located on the holder the penetrator tube. The TM radiometer          was calibrated in the Space simulator at DLR Berlin using an          LN2 cooled low temperature blackbody. The calibrated          temperature range was 120-270 K. TM is further equipped with an         inflight calibration device (a cylindrical blackbody which          covers a small part of the FOV which can be heated up to          400 K). Inflight calibration runs performed during cruise have         revealed a significant degradation compared to the ground          calibration (suffered already on Earth !). Therefore, the final         calibration of TM was done using the deep space view during the         descent of Philae to the comet.                                                                                                                                  Operational Considerations            ==========================                                The sensor heads PENEL and TM are both equipped with a          front-end-electronics which require a certain minimum switch-on         temperature (-50 deg for PEN and -90 deg for TM). Therefore, a         warm-up heating phase controlled by the MUPUS DPU is required         before these sensor heads can be switched on.                                                                  Detectors                                           =========                                          MUPUS comprises of three sensors: a cylindrical Penetrator tube         with a length of ~ 35 cm and a diameter of 1 cm which is          equipped with 16 RTD-type thermal sensors made by sputtering          Titan on a Kapton foil. The sensors can also serve as heaters         for acctive thermal conductivity measurements; an infrared          radiometer equipped with 4 thermopile detectors and the          necessary reference temperature sensors realized by miniature         Pt-1000; the Philae harpoons which are each equipped with a          Pt-100 temperature sensor and an accelerometer working at a          sampling frequence of 48 kHz.         More details are found in Spohn et.al, 2007                                                                                                                                     Electronics                                                  ===========                                                      Details on the electronics of the instrument are described in          Spohn, et.al, 2007.                                                                                                                                                                         ========                                                            MUPUS PEN is mounted on the Lander balcony attached to its          deployment device (DD) during cruise. After landing on the          comet the DD will be used to deploy PEN up to a maximum          distance of 1 m from the balcony. TM is mounted on the V-strut         on the balcony close to the CIVA-St camera and below the Tx/Rx          antennas. The harpoons are located below the Lander baseplate          and may penetrate up to 2 m depth after the shot. The MUPUS          central electronics is located inside the warm compartment of         Philae.                                                                            Operational Modes                                           =================                                             MUPUS can be operated in several different different modes. The         main mode is TEM which performs temperature measurements using          all MUPUS thermal sensors (PEN, TM, ANC-T) in regular time          intervals. A similar mode but without measuring the PEN sensors         is MAPPER which should  be used if the PEN is not deployed. The         third thermal mode of the instrument is THC which performs an          active thermal conductivity measurement using a (configurable)         number of PEN sensors for heating. Further operational modes          are ARM (deploying the PEN), HAMMER (inserting PEN into the          ground), and ANCHOR (fast sampling of the accelerometers in the         harpoons after the shot).                                                                            Subsystems                                                      ==========                                                      The sub-systems are described in Spohn et al, 2007.                                                                                                                                             Measured Parameters                                             ===================                                              Measured parameters are temperatures for PEN and ANC-T,         brightness temperatures which are equivalent to infrared net         fluxes for TM, and acceleration for ANC-M.

Operational Considerations                                                       ==========================                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Detectors                                                                        =========                                                                        The detector is an ion trap mass spectrometer.                                                                                                                                                                                                     Electronics                                                                      ===========                                                                      Details on the electronics of the instrument are described in                    the Ptolemy ADP.                                                                                                                                                  Location                                                                         ========                                                                         Ptolemy is mounted on the large Pi-plate in the warm                             compartment of Philae.  Samples are delivered by the Sample                      Drilling and Distribution unit (SD2) to ovens located on the                     balcony of Philae.                                                                                                                                                Operational Modes                                                                =================                                                                Ptolemy operates in three distinct modes; Safe, Standby and                      Science.  Housekeeping data is collected during all three                        modes.  On power on, Ptolemy enters Safe mode.                                   Safe mode is used for processor memory management such as                        loading new science sequences and check memory commands. The                     only mode change is from Safe to Standby mode.                                   Standby mode is used to enable components for use during the                     subsequent Science mode.  Ptolemy can be commanded to operate                    a Science mode sequence or be returned to Safe mode.                             Science mode operates a previously loaded sequence. At the                       successful completion of a Science mode sequence, Ptolemy                        returns to Standby mode.                                                                                                                                          Subsystems                                                                       ==========                                                                       The subsystems are: Sample Collection (SC), Gas Distribution                     and Processing System (GDPS), Gas Chromatography (GC), and                       Mass Spectrometer (MS).                                                          Sample collection consists mainly of the SD2 instrument which                    acquires solid samples and distributes them to Ptolemy ovens on                  the carousel.  Gaseous samples can also be collected by an oven                  filled with molecular sieve or be analysed directly by the mass                  spectrometer.                                                                    The Gas Distribution and Processing System consists of heaters,                  valves temperature and pressure sensors in order to prepare the                  sample for direct MS analysis or for injection into one of                       three columns of the GC system.  The GDPS also contains                          reference materials so that the comet samples can be directly                    compared with terrestrial compounds of known isotopic value.                     The Gas Chromatography system includes 3 GC columns to separate                  the sample into individual components as well as the helium                      carrier gas required for gas chromatography.                                     The Mass spectrometer analyses compounds giving a mass spectrum                  as they are eluted from a GC column.                                             The sub-systems are described in more detail in Morse et al,                     2009.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Measured Parameters                                                              ===================                                                              The Ptolemy GC measures the retention times of molecular                         species in separation columns, the Ptolemy MS measures the mass                  to charge ratio of ionised fragments of molecular species. The                   temperature and pressure of various components are monitored.

From here, ROLIS can observe about 30x30 cm of the nucleus          surface below the Lander at a spatial sampling of 0.3mm/pixel.         In order to illuminate the image field, ROLIS incorporates four         independent arrays of light emitting diodes (LEDs) radiating         through the visible and near-IR, in spectral bands          centred at 470, 530, 640 and 870nm, with a Full Width Half         Maximum of about 100nm.         ROLIS will also operate during the descent phase, imaging the         landing site and its vicinity shortly before touchdown.                        From images of the cometary surface ROLIS will seek to identify         the possible presence of a dust mantle, refractory crust and         exposed ice.         If present, surface features such as pores, cracks and vents         would be readily detected, as well as traces of erosion caused         by sublimation, ice grains and carbonaceous aggregates larger         than the ROLIS spatial resolution limits.                  Together, the descent sequence and the close-up images will         reveal the surface features over a broad range of scale         lengths, allowing an assessment of the surface's diversity.                  Multi-spectral imaging in four spectral channels will allow us         to complement the spatial information with spectral information.         Although the limited spectral range and resolution of ROLIS will         not allow exact mineralogy to be extracted, the study of the         spectral slope should allow a broad classification of the solid         surface phases to be derived, distinguishing between         carbonaceous, silicates and organic materials. Further, the         analysis of colour ratios over a given field will provide         information on the degree of soil heterogeneity at small scales.                Operational Considerations                                              ==========================                                                 The Rosetta Lander and its payload are designed to achieve the         primary mission goals within 3 days of landing, which takes         place when the comet is at a heliocentric distance of 3 AU,         before the onset of major cometary activity. Rosetta will         approach the comet in the year 2014 and will start its descent         phase at the ending of 2014. Should an extended mission be         possible, it will be of great interest to use ROLIS to search         for signs of evolution of the surface features as the         Churyumov-Gerasimenko (CG) approaches the Sun.            The ROLIS camera is designed for operations at temperatures          down to -150 deg C what makes it possible to operate on the         comet between approximately 3.5 to 1.8 AU. The comparatively         warm temperatures at 1.8 AU would not be a problem for ROLIS         either.                                       Imaging the borehole sides could reveal stratification and         provide          clues on the mechanical strength of the surface layer. This         could be achieved by rotating the Lander around its axis by a         few degrees.            The detection and precise measurement of the surface features         would be greatly facilitated by the acquisition of stereo         pairs, also achieved by rotating the Lander. They would provide         the additional information from the lone-of-sight dimension,         making it easier to identify surface features visually and to         quantify their dimensions.                                                                                             Calibration                                                             ===========                                                             Following calibration functions are applied to the ROLIS         images at DLR :               1) Dark correction: Each image is corrected by                  subtracting a dark frame derived by ground or                  in-flight calibrations.                              2) Flat filed correction: each image is corrected by                  applying calibration flat fields derived during ground                  calibration.                              3) If possible, photometric cross-calibration with OSIRIS                  data                                                                                                                                                 Electronics                                                             ===========                                                             The Imaging Main Electronics (IME) is a facility device,         developed under the co-responsibility of IWP/DLR and IAS, for         both ROLIS and CIVA: they share a common interface with the         Lander, for both the power subsystem and the Central Data         Management System (CDMS).            The ROLIS IME tasks include implementation of the commanding         interface to the Lander, data acquisition from the ROLIS-D         camera, local storage of the images, image processing and         compression, recording of HK information and the data link to         the Lander. In addition, it provides storage, commanding, and         telemetry support for the CIVA instrument, which is interfaced         through a dedicated digital signal processor board.         The ROLIS-part of IME consists of the DPU- and the MM- (Mass         Memory) boards. The DPU is based on a Harris RTX 2010 processor         running at 10 MHz and programmed in FORTH. The ROLIS experiment         S/W is stored in a 64-kByte EEPROM, which can be partially or         completely uploaded during flight.         The MM consists of 16 MBytes of static RAM which is used as         buffer for images and temporary storage. The memory enables         the storage of a maximum of 7 uncompressed images and several         compressed images, which number depends on their compression         ratio, and is allocated to both the ROLIS and CIVA experiments.            To gain comprehensive information about the ROLIS-DPU here a          few details:         - Processor: Harris RTX-2010RH at 10 MHz         - FPGA: Actel 1280 RH          - 16 KByte PROM with Common DPU (ComDPU) Software         - 64 KByte EEPROM with ROLIS Software         - 256 KByte SRAM         - 14 bit ADC for ROLIS and CIVA analogue HK         - interface to CDMS (max. 32 kbps), Watchdog         - 78 kbps serial DPU-DPU I/F to the CIVA part of IME         - Extension bus for special experiment hardware.            The following notes contain details about the ROLIS MM:         - FPGA: Actel 54SX16 RT          - 4x 32 Mbit SRAM cubes for images          - Memory controller         - High-speed serial I/F to the ROLIS-D (10 Mbits per second).               Accommodation                                                           ============                                                            The two main modules of ROLIS, the ROLIS-D camera and the         on-board processor unit & Mass Memory as part of the IME are         located on the Lander at different sites:         The IME is located in the warm compartment of PHILAE in the         Central Elelectronics Box (CEB-Z) , whereas ROLIS-D is situated         on the Lander balcony. Both ROLIS constituents are connected         via a cable.                                         The ROLIS-D location on the  instrument common working circle          allows it to inspect the sampling sites of the Lander's in situ         analyzers before and after the drilling operation. Such          inspection, achieved by rotating the Lander body, can provide         an important contribution to the interpretation of the sample         analysis, by placing these measurements into the context of the         surface colours and morphology.          Software         ========         Two types of software are used:          1. ComDPU software (in the PROM)         2. ROLIS software (in the EEPROM).             After power switch on first the ComDPU software will be copied         into RAM and started from the RAM. Analogue for the ROLIS         software: after starting the boot process the ROLIS software         will be copied from the EEPROM into the RAM (overwriting the         ComDPU software) and get started.            Detector Geometry         =============                                                      The ROLIS CCD consists of a matrix of a total of 1066x1064 pixels         of which 1024x1024 are active and are used for imaging.                   Each line consists of 1066 elements organized as follows:                      - 2 dummy pixel	         - 10 inactive prescan pixels (can be used to estimate bias level)         - 1 isolation pixel          - 16 masked pixels (can be used to estimate dark current)         - 5 isolation pixels         - 1024 useful imaging pixels          - 8 inactive postscan pixels (can be used to estimate bias level)                 Each frame is made of 1064 lines organized as follows:                  - 1 dummy line         - 12 masked lines (can be used to estimate dark current)         - 3 isolation lines         - 1024 useful imaging lines          - 3 isolation lines         - 12 masked lines (can be used to estimate dark current)         - 1 dummy line         - 8 inactive postscan lines (can be used to estimate bias level)            Imaging Modes                                                       =============                                                      ROLIS can be operated in 3 basic imaging modes:            - SINGLE IMAGE MODE          In this mode the 1024x1024 active area is stored. The image          can be acquired with or without LED illumination.                   - DESCENT IMAGING RING-BUFFER-MODE          In this mode the 1024x1024 active area is stored in the 7-position          ring buffer. The newest images overwrite the oldest one.           The acquisition sequence is stopped by the touchdown signal.          The images are acquired without LED illumination.                  - FULL-FRAME IMAGE STRIPE                                 In this mode the full 1066x1064 array is readout, but only           a 1066x30 subframe is relayed. This mode is used for diagnostic           and for monitoring the bias level and dark generation.                        Measured Parameters                                                     ===================                          The basic product of ROLIS are images.         The ROLIS-D optics project a square Field Of View          of 57.7 deg x 57.7 deg onto the CCD. This gives a sampling of          about 0,33mm/pixel at an object distance of 30cm. With the         Infinity Lens (IFL) in the optical path, the objective is         focused for objects at distances ranging from 1.4m to infinity.         With it removed, the camera is focused at an object distance         of 30cm with a depth of field of approximately (+10; -8) cm.

urn:esa:psa:context:instrument:rl.romap,ROSETTA Lander Magnetometer and Plasma Monitor for RL,ROSETTA Lander Magnetometer and Plasma Monitor,"          Instrument Overview         ===================         The ROMAP sensors (fluxgate magnetometer, electrostatic          analyser and Faraday cup) measure the magnetic field from         0 to 32Hz, ions up to 8.0 keV and electrons up to 4.2 keV.          High integration level of sensors and electronics is the basic         for a combined field/plasma measurement instrument with less         than 1 Watt power consumption and 1 kg mass.          Additional two pressure sensors are included in the ROMAP          sensor arrangement.         The sensors are moved from COSAC to ROMAP to optimise long         term operation of pressure sensors. Data of both pressure         sensors are transmitted within the housekeeping frame and         are handled / archived as housekeeping values.            Scientific Objectives         =====================         Main scientific goals of ROMAP are         (1) long term measurements on the surface to study the             cometary activity as function of the distance from the Sun         and         (2) magnetic measurements during the descent phase of the             Lander to investigate the structure of the remnant             magnetization of the nucleus.            Calibration         ===========         MAG : Data are precalibrated by nominal scaling. Offsets can                not be corrected automatically. This will be done by               sequence specific cal files (L3).                Finally corrected data (includes the removal of               spacecraft disturbances) are only available for selected               data of scientific interest (L5).         SPM : Instrument calibration will be done preliminary (L3) and               finally for derived data products (L5).               Operational Considerations         ==========================         Main measurement sequences are:         - During Flybys         - During Descent         - On cometary Surface        Common operation with Instruments generating magnetic        interferences shall be avoided.        Common operation with RPC-MAG onboard the orbiter is highly        desirable            Electronics         ===========        The ROMAP electronics consists of two boards placed inside the        common electronics box. The central part of the near sensor        electronics on the first board is a FPGA which controls AD and        DA-converters. The 16-bit AD converters are digitising science        and housekeeping data from all three sensors. Typical analogue        parts of fluxgate magnetometers like filters or phase-sensitive        integrators are substituted by fast digitalization of the sensor        AC-signal and the following data processing in FPGA's (which        overtakes the functions of the former analogue parts). In this        way mass is saved without any loss of accuracy. The resolution        is still restricted by sensor noise (less than 5pT/sqrt(Hz)        at 1Hz), not by electronics. Compensation fields for the magnetometer        and high voltage steps for electrostatic analyser and Faraday cup        are controlled via DA-converters (dashed lines). The near sensor        electronics is developed by Magson GmbH Berlin The high voltage        generator (developed by the KFKI) is in a separate shielded box        on the front panel of the common electronics box. The controller        is located on the second ROMAP board.        It controls MAG and SPM, stores their data output and implements        the interface to the Lander Command and Data Management System         (CDMS). It triggers the measurement cycle of the magnetometer,        implements the digital magnetometer algorithm, controls the         magnetometer feedback and generates data frames. For the SPM        sensors the controller has implemented the counting logic for        electrons and ions, samples Faraday cup data, generates SPM data        frames, controls the high voltage parameters (energy,        elevation), controls the channeltron HV-supply and computes the        plasma parameters. In the parameter mode only the sums of the        rows and columns of the sampled ion and ion-current arrays are        transmitted.        The controller is based on a RTX2010. Address decoder, reset        logic, clock generators, control signals generator, watchdog        logic and CDMS interface are integrated within a FPGA. Hard- and        software are developed by the IWF Graz.            Sensor / Sensor Location         ========================        The magnetometer sensor consists of two ringcores (crossed in to        each other) as well as pick-up coils and Helmholtz coils for        each sensor axis. The coil system design without mechanical        support allows the compensation of the external field on the        ringcore position with high homogeneity and low weight (the        overall sensor weight is 30g). Dynamic feedback fields as well        as offset fields up to 2000nT can be generated in order to        compensate Lander and/or Orbiter DC stray fields. The main part        of the SPM-sensor is a hemispherical electrostatic analyzer with        two channeltrons (CEM's) for ions measurement and one for        electrons measurement. The entry of the ion channels is equipped        with deflection plates to realize the spatial resolution.         Despite the small size of the sensor, the sensitivity and        resolution of the instrument are high and its field of view wide        (appr. 100 degree).        The E/q-range extends from 0 to 8 kV. Using CEMs in counting        mode the electrostatic analyzer measures electron and ion        distribution in a wide energy range. Hemisherical deflection        plates analyze the energy in 32 or 64 steps. All major plasma        parameters as bulk velocity, density and isotropic temperature        of protons and electrons can be derived.        A retarding-grid Faraday cup sensor is implemented to measure        currents due to fluxes of low energy charged particles on a        collector plate. The Faraday cup measures the 'reduced' velocity        distribution of the plasma due to its inherent integration over        velocities contained in a plane of differential thickness        perpendicular to the axis of the sensor. The combined        magnetometer / SPM sensor is mounted on a 60 cm boom which is        fixed with a hinge on the upper edge of the Lander structure        and with a launch lock on the Lander balcony. After opening the        launch lock, the boom will be deployed by two springs inside        the hinge.         Two pressure sensors are selected to cover the whole pressure        range from 10^-8 mbar to 10 mbar. For the range from 10^-8 mbar        to 10^-3 mbar an ionising system (Penning) is deployed while for        the range from 10^-3 mbar to 10 mbar a heat conduction sensor        (Minipirani) is available.               Operational Modes         =================         ROMAP can be basically operated in 3 modes:         - Slow Mode         - Fast Mode         - Surface Mode            Subsystems         ==========         The sub-systems are described in Auster et al, 2005.               Measured Parameters         ===================         Magnetic field; resolution 10 pT         Electrons: 0.35 ... 4200 eV         Ions: 40 ... 8000 eV         Pressure; 10^-8 mbar to 10 mbar.

SD2 is composed by a          Drill, Carousel, Volume  Checker and electronic box. The          Drill creates the hole and collects samples at different          depths. The samples are placed in ovens mounted on the          distribution subsystem, the Carousel, which is in charge of         distributing the samples to the designated experiment.         Before distribution, the volume of the collected sample is          measured by the Volume Checker.          Scientific Objectives                                                     =====================                 The scientific goal of SD2 is to collect samples from the          comet soil, measure the volume of the sample using the Volume          Checker, and distribute the collected samples to the experiments         CIVA and COSAC. In conjunction with complementary data from          lander subsystems and instruments, SD2 scientific data can also         be used to determine the depth at which the sample has been          collected.          Calibration                                           ===========                 No calibration is planned for the telemetry data. Only a          translation in more comprehensible format is performed. Thus,         the calibrated data are obtained by the mere translation of the         raw data.                                                                                   Operational Considerations                                               ==========================               SD2 translation is commanded in offsets from SD2 reference (zero)         position. Thus, the operator cannot command the depth directly:         the depth reached can be deduced if the distance of the soil from         the lander baseplate in the drilling area is available.          Operational Modes         =================         Two main operational modes are foreseen for SD2 Nominal and Dead         mode. The first one is for the nominal operational mode; the second         one is associated to failure occurrence.

urn:esa:psa:context:instrument:rl.sesame,Surface Electric Sounding and Acoustic Monitoring Experiment for RL,Surface Electric Sounding and Acoustic Monitoring Experiment,"                                                                                                                                    CASSE         ======                   Instrument Overview                                                        ===================                                                        The Comet Acoustic Surface Sounding Experiment (CASSE) should             study the cometary surface layer by applying active and passive            methods.             To this end, CASSE uses accelerometers (ACC) and custom-made Piezo            stacks (called transmitter = TRM) mounted in the soles of Philae's            feet that can record and generate vibrations in the audible            frequency range. The temperature of each sensor is monitored by a             thermistor (PT 1000) for calibration purposes.                  By command, any combination of receivers and transmitters can be            selected. The sounding frequency can be varied from 10 Hz to            10000 Hz for a duration up to 2000 s. The sampling frequency can            be varied from 80 Hz to 100000 Hz for a recording duration also            up to 2000 s.            The nominal gain can be varied in 16 irregular steps from 1 to            168 by combining four amplifier stages. Thus, CASSE can either            excite elastic waves that are transmitted through the cometary             matter beneath Philae and recorded by CASSE sensors or detect such            waves generated by other artificial or natural sources. The use of            triaxial accelerometers allows a polarization analysis and thus the            distinction of different wave types.                  The CASSE electronics is controlled by the common SESAME             flight software.                        Scientific Objective                                               ====================                                                       The scientific objective of CASSE is to study lateral and vertical            elastic and structural properties of the cometary surface layer             over the foot-to-foot distance of about two meter. The quality of             these investigations depends on the elastic properties of the             surface material and its mechanical contact to the lander soles.                  The primary goal of the CASSE investigation is to determine elastic            parameters like Young s modulus and the Poisson ratio as well as            their daily and seasonal variations by analyzing the registered            signal profiles of (repeated) active soundings or by recording            artificial signals like the Philae touchdown and the MUPUS-Pen            hammering.                  Additional goals are:             - The monitoring of thermally or impact-caused cometary               activity and the localization of activity spots;             - The determination of the macro-structure of the cometary               surface, such as the expected layering or embedded               inhomogeneities, by using refraction and / or reflection               seismograms;             - The study of emitted particles impacting on the soles during the               orbit phase as well as during the descent to the cometary                surface.                                                                                        Electronics                                                                ===========            The CASSE sensors are controlled by an electronics board (PCB) as            part of the SESAME central electronics. The general design of the            CASSE PCB is that of a triggerable 12-channel transient recorder            (9 accelerometer and 3 transmitter channels) with a sampling rate            of up to 100 kHz that will be distributed evenly on the channels            selected. The electronics also includes a signal generator with a            variable output frequency for the three transmitters. The received            signals coming from the input multiplexer are amplified with a             selectable gain ranging from 1 to 168 (0 to 44.5 dB), converted by            an 7-bit custom-made analog-to-digital converter (ADC) plus sign            bit and recorded in a 128 kByte ring buffer. The transfer function            of the ADC is quasi-logarithmic, using piecewise linear approximation.            A recorded signal is read from the CASSE memory by the SESAME flight            software and further processed or handed over to the Philae Command            and Data Management System (CDMS) for downlink.                        Location                                                                   ========                                                                   The three CASSE triaxial accelerometers (Bruel and Kjaer, type 4506            W002) are mounted in the left sole of each Philae s feet (looking            from Philae s center) above the electrode mesh of the SESAME            Permittivity Probe (PP) instrument. The other sole of each foot             contains a custom-made Piezo stack (producer FHG-IfZP) that can             generate and record vibrations.                  The ACC are connected by 4-wire cables separated from the            transmitters (using 9-wire cables) to the CASSE electronics in            order to reduce cross talk between transmitting and receiving            lines. But this principle is broken in three common connectors            between the CASSE electronics and the sensors.                  The thermistors (PT 1000) are mounted directly on each sensor            using the a 2-wire connection with a common ground in the 9-wire            cables of the transmitters.                                                                                                  Subsystems                                                                 ==========                                                                 None                        Operational Considerations                                                 ==========================                                                 SESAME-CASSE is sensitive to external vibrations. During the cruise            phase CASSE recorded e.g. the vibrations caused by the dither            actuators of the orbiter gyros as well as those generated by the            Philae flywheel. Any mechanical activity that is not needed for            the proper CASSE measurement was avoided during CASSE operations.                  In addition, CASSE also detected CONSERT soundings as fake            acceleration signals. Thus parallel operation of CASSE and CONSERT            were reduced to a minimum and avoided during the touchdown            measurements at Agilkia.                                                                                             Operational Modes                                                          =================                                                          CASSE can be operated in 5 modes:            1) Health Check: This mode executes a programmed sequence with no                tele-command parameters.               A ping (a vibration with 1000 Hz and a duration of 5 ms) is               sequentially generated by the transmitters of each foot and                simultaneously recorded by the accelerometer on the same foot               (x, y, z axes; total listening duration per foot: 40 ms, sampling               rate per channel: 16 kHz). The amplifier gain is set to 53.79.                The measurements are repeated once. As this mode uses the closest               possible distance between sounder and receiver for CASSE, the               health of transmitter, accelerometer and CASSE electronics               can be checked by this operation. The quality of the Health Check               measurements is checked by the repetition.                  2) Listening Mode: The simplest operating mode of CASSE is the               Listening mode. Any combination and number of accelerometer               channels and transmitters can be operated as receivers. Various               parameters like sampling frequency and duration and gain can be               set by executing a CASSE jobcard (a tele-command used for                setting the CASSE instrument parameters) before executing the               Listening mode. The common operation of accelerometers and               transmitters as receivers should be avoided, as in this case               large DC offsets are generated by the CASSE electronics.                  3) Trigger Mode: The Trigger mode is a special case of the               Listening mode as one or more receiver channels are designated               as trigger channels. All incoming data in the receiver channels               are stored in the CASSE RAM in FIFO mode until the signal               exceeds predefined positive or negative trigger levels or the               Trigger time-out duration is reached. The trigger levels and                gain can be set either by command or automatically by executing               at least two Listenings before the Trigger operation. When a                trigger event is detected, additional data are stored in the               CASSE RAM until the end of the recording duration.               These data, including a time period before the trigger event               (called 'trigger delay'), are then transferred to the SESAME               Common Data Processing Unit.                  4) Sounding Mode: In the Sounding mode at least one transmitter               is excited and the signal via the Philae landing gear and / or               the cometary surface can be registered by any combination               of CASSE receivers. By using a CASSE jobcard, the sounding               frequency and duration can be set. It should be noted that               the CASSE electronics only allows a limited number of               combinations of sounding and receiving frequencies within               the operating ranges of transmitters and accelerometers.                   5) Stacking Mode: The Stacking mode is a special case of the               Sounding mode, as the soundings can be repeated and up to               127 linearized time series can be stacked in order to improve               the signal-to-noise ratio.                  In any operation mode of the SESAME flight software version FM-3            statistics data (minimum, maximum and mean of each recorded time            series (in ADC units)) can be stored and transferred to ground.             This option is quite useful for the Stacking mode, as only the            statistics data can tell, whether any problematic time series            (flat lines, background noise variation) were stacked on board.             At least flat line time series, which are sometimes produced by            the CASSE electronics and result in all three statistics parameters            having the same value, can be removed on ground.                                                                                              Calibration                                                                ===========            The nominal CASSE calibration comprises the following steps:                  a1) All modes but Stacking mode:                Linearize the sample ADC value by inverting the                 quasi-logarithmic ADC curve and convert the result to                 voltage before ADC.            a2) Only Stacking mode:                Divide the sample, which is actually the sum of linearized                samples from several measurements, by the number of                measurements and perform voltage conversion. In this step                any flat line time series (see above) can be removed by                subtracting the flat line value(s) from the sum and reducing                the number of measurements accordingly.            b)  Convert the voltage before ADC to the output voltage of the                 sensors by dividing the ADC voltage by the nominal amplifier                gain.            c)  Divide the output voltage by the sensor sensitivity to get the                acceleration in [m s^-2].                The accelerometers are individually calibrated by the producer                Bruel and Kjaer and have a typical sensitivity                 10 mV/(m s**-2) +-5 percent in the range from 10 Hz to                 about 5 kHz (depending on axis). No sensitivity data are                available for the transmitters, whose signals are pre-amplified                before entering the CASSE amplifier. A few measurements during                the Rosetta cruise phase indicate that an external signal in                ADC units recorded by a transmitter is about twice as large as                that recorded by an accelerometer.                                                                                                                                                                  Measured Parameters                                                        ===================            All CASSE operation modes record time series of acceleration values.            Most of these data are transferred to ground as un-calibrated            quasi-logarithmic ADC values. Only the Stacking mode delivers            linearized summed up time series. Additionally, several time stamps            (e.g. start and end of recording) are transmitted, in order to            determine the correct absolute time series start on ground. At least            at the beginning of each measurement, the temperatures of all CASSE            sensors (also those not used in this operation) are collected.               DIM         ====            Instrument Overview                                                        ===================                                                        DIM applies the principle of piezoelectricity to detect and analyze                 impacting cometary dust particles. An impact evokes a decaying            electric signal (burst), which is a mixture of several frequencies,            at the output of the sensor. At the beginning of this transient            signal a nearly perfect half-sine wave can be observed, which lasts            for the impact duration.             The peak voltage is observed when the impact deformation reaches            its maximum (elastic impacts are supposed). During the second            quarter of the sine wave, the deformation caused by the particle            decreases until the grain leaves the sensor.            The piezoelectric sensors of DIM are mounted on a cube with about            7 cm side length. Three sides of the cube are covered with sensors,            the other three sides are either closed by aluminum plates or left            open for harness access. Each of the active DIM sides is divided            into three equally sized segments that carry rectangular            piezoelectric sensors made of PNZT7700 (Pb, Ni, Zi, Ti).             The size of each segment is 50x16x1 mm**3. Adding all nine active            segments leads to about 70 cm**2 total sensor area.            The DIM electronics is controlled by the common SESAME flight            software.                  Scientific Objectives                                               =====================                                                       When the ice on a cometary surface is heated by solar radiation,            the gas molecules released by the ice sublimation drag grains            composed of refractory (dust) and volatile (ices) matter from the            cometary surface. Due to the combined action of gas drag and            gravitational forces, grains are either ejected into space becoming            part of the interplanetary dust or are drawn back by gravity onto            the cometary surface. The goal of the DIM instrument is to improve            our knowledge about these particulate constituents of comets.             DIM obtains quantitative data on:              - Directional statistics of impacting particles;              - Velocity and mass distribution of back-fallen particles and for                 particles on escape trajectories from the nucleus.            These data are to collected over an extended time period in order to            find possible correlations with the cometary diurnal and orbital            phases. The analysis of these data should help to:              - Improve our models of the distribution and the flux of                near-surface dust and small particles as a function of their                size and velocity;              - Understand cometary activity with its underlying processes;              - Explain the formation of cometary mantles                                                                                       Calibration                                                                ===========                                                                Each particle impact onto one of the piezoelectric sensor plates            generates an electric pulse that is registered with the instrument            electronics. The measured signals are analysed by Hertz' theory of            contact mechanics. The output signal can be approximated by a damped            sine wave. The amplitude and the width of the first half-sine pulse            are registered by the instrument electronics and used to derive            particle properties like the reduced modulus and the mass. To            calibrate the instrument signals, a large number of drop             experiments with particles made of different materials             were performed.                  Operational Considerations                                                 ==========================                                                 SESAME-DIM turned out to be very sensitive to electrical            disturbances by the MPPTs of the solar energy generators on board            Philae. Therefore, several of the measurements obtained during            Philae s descent to the surface of comet 67P (Agilkia) were            disturbed by a large number of false signals. Only very few single            false signals were recorded at the final landing site Abydos where            DIM was operated at night when the solar arrays were not            illuminated. False signals are characterised by the instrument             software as true dust impacts but for which we know by other            means that they cannot be due to dust impacts. The instrument            software is not able to distinguish false signals and dust impacts.                                                                                       Electronics                                                                ===========                                                                      The DIM instrument is controlled by an electronics board as part            of the SESAME electronics and receives its +5V digital and +/-5V            analog power from the SESAME power supply board. The analog and            the digital ground are separated. The signals coming from a given            PZT sensor face are amplified by a logarithmic amplifier (U_out)            which is then sent to a peak detector (U_Peak). The DIM electronics            can detect an event if the amplified signal voltage U_out exceeds            an adaptive threshold value U_thr. The detection threshold U_thr is            the sum of an adjustable margin and a signal average.             The margin can be increased in steps of 10 dB in the range from 10            to 70 dB. Each step changes the threshold voltage by approximately            0.3 V.             The signal average is determined by the DIM electronics with a time             constant of approximately 1 s. It varies slowly with impact            properties and frequency, aiming at covering a wide range of event            voltage levels.             According to Hertz' theory the initial part of the dust impact            signal can be approximated by the first half of a sine wave. An             impact should thus show up as a voltage, crossing the threshold            voltage upwards, followed by a second threshold crossing downwards.            The period between the two threshold crossings defines the impact            duration Tc. If the amplified sensor signal crosses the detection            threshold too early (less than 1 ms after the single event            measurement was initialized), the event is classified as a             false event, else it is accepted as the beginning of a potential            real impact. In BCT2 mode (see Section Operational Modes), the            measurement is stopped after 1.6 ms. The event is ruled out as a            long event, if no second threshold crossing was detected within            500 microseconds (in case of the BC mode, this limit is 79             microseconds) during the measurement duration.             A true dust impact is thus characterised by its occurrence later            than 1 ms after the initialization of the measurement and a duration            of less than 500 microseconds for the BCT2 and 79 microseconds for            the BC mode, respectively. Regardless of the event type (dust impact,            false signal, false or long event), an adjustable dead time, the             so-called sensor signal decay time is included after the end of each            single event measurement.             Apart from the signal decay time, several waiting and latency            periods are added to the total duration of a single impact            measurement. All latency periods add up to a total instrument dead            time of approximately 10 ms.                  Location                                                                   ========                                                                   The DIM cube is mounted on the top side of Philae, and the three            active sensor sides point in the +X, +Y and +Z directions in the            Philae coordinate system.                   Operational Modes                                                          =================                                                          Before any DIM measurement is started, a few operations have to be            performed to guarantee that DIM is properly working.             After DIM is switched on:                (A) A power check is performed to verify that the supply                   voltages are within predefined limits. Then                (B) Electronic noise is measured on the DIM amplifier (with                   the DIM sensor being disconnected): Starting from a very                   low value, the detection threshold (so-called margin) is                   increased in steps of 10 dB until no false                    event is detected anymore. The rates of false events                   typically encountered in flight were such that the margin                   was set to 30 dB or 40 dB. This means that a true dust                   impact must have an amplitude of at least 0.1 mV or                    0.25 mV, respectively, to overcome the threshold of the                   amplifier. In a next step                (C) A DIM sensor test checks if all three sensor sides are                   operational. An electrical pulse (approximately 5 V for                   10 microseconds) is applied to each sensor side, and the                   response is registered in the same way a dust impact would                   be measured. Finally                (D) The electronics performs a DIM calibration to re-calibrate                   the transfer characteristic of the logarithmic amplifier                   and to check the time measuring circuit: Two test pulses                   are applied to the logarithmic amplifier. Pulse height and                   duration are 1 mV, 8 microseconds for low-level and 100 mV,                   20 microseconds for high-level, respectively. The results                   of the calibration procedure were supposed to be used to                   re-calibrate the amplifier transfer function in the data                   evaluation on Earth. However, it turned out after launch                   that the high-level value is in saturation so that this                    re-calibration procedure could not be applied.             After successful execution of the above listed steps, DIM is ready            for measuring dust impacts. Two measurement modes were used to            measure dust at the comet:               (1) Single events on one sensor side can be registered in the                   so-called Burst Continuous (BC) Mode. The measured peak                   amplitude U_m and the impact duration T_c are stored in a                   compressed way: They are scaled to a logarithmic scale,                    and the counts for impacts with a particular logarithmic                   U_m, T_c combination are stored in memory cells of different                   sizes, depending on the expected frequency of such events.                   Each BC measurement starts with a 10 s instrument warm-up                   period which is not included in the measuring time.               (2) In addition to the BC mode (which delivers the logarithmic                   U_m, T_c matrix), the instrument can be operated in a                   so-called Burst Continuous Test2 mode (BCT2). Similar to the                   BC mode, the BCT2 mode delivers U_m and T_c for each                    individual impact. Here the raw uncompressed data are                   transmitted instead of the compressed logarithmic values, and                   in addition the event time when the impact or false signal                   was registered. The number of data sets for impacts,                    which can be stored and transmitted to Earth in BCT2 mode, is                   limited to 350.             Measuring values for the respective sensor side of the signal average            are transmitted to Earth if sampling of average values is commanded.                  Subsystems                                                                 ==========                                                                 None                                                                                                                                                                  Measured Parameters                                                        ===================            The electrical pulse generated by a particle hitting the DIM sensor            is to first order a damped sine wave. The signal curve is analysed            by the instrument electronics, and two parameters - impact duration            T_c and the peak voltage U_m - are derived from the signal curve and            transmitted to Earth.               A) Impact Duration               The impact duration is derived from the number of counts of a               20 MHz clock.                So-called false and long events are identified. These                events are defined according to the measured impact duration.               They are counted with an onboard counter and only their total               numbers are transmitted to Earth. The impact                durations are transmitted for true dust impacts, but not for               false and long  events.               B) Peak Voltage               The instrument provides the peak voltage of a single dust impact               after logarithmic amplification. The transfer characteristics of               the logarithmic DIM amplifier can vary with time. It is regularly               checked by a calibration procedure.               C) Event Time               In addition to the impact duration and the peak voltage of a               signal, the time in UTC when the event occurred is also stored               for up to 350 events transmitted in Burst Continuous Test2 mode               (not in Burst Continuous mode).               PP         ==                  Instrument Overview                                                        ===================                                                        PP is based on a quadrupole configuration of sensors attached to            different parts of the Lander which are capacitively coupled to            the comet surface.            Metal meshes included in the soles of the +Y and -Y feet serve as            receiving electrodes, connected via preamplifiers inside the soles            to the SESAME electronics.            Three transmitter electrodes are integrated with the +X foot sole,            the MUPUS PEN and the APXS detector, respectively. Any combination            of transmitter  electrodes can be selected by software. A digitally            generated electrical sine wave of a freely programmable frequency            is applied to the transmitter electrodes causing an AC-current to            flow through the medium and cause a varying potential in the near            environment of the Lander. Current, potential and phase difference            between them are measured to determine the electrical properties            of the medium underneath the Lander.            The PP electronics is controlled by the common SESAME flight            software.                  Scientific Objectives                                               =====================                                                       Characterize the complex permittivity of the nucleus surface            material, i.e. the electrical conductivity and dielectric            polarizability, and their frequency and time dependences, down            to a depth commensurate with the size of the lander. Assess the             sublimation rate of the volatile deposits, as functions of             temperature, illumination, and solar distance.            Secondary objective: Measure the plasma density, and the            electromagnetic and electrostatic waves generated by the             interaction between the nucleus environment and the solar wind,            and thus monitor the outgassing activity            of the comet.

Using laboratory simulations and reference measurements the measured            data are converted and the instrument team's laboratory to             conductivity and permittivity values of the material in the vicinity            of the electrodes.                  Operational Considerations                                                 ==========================                                                 SESAME-PP is very sensitive to any kind of electrical disturbances.            During active or passive (permittivity or plasma) measurements            instruments generating radio waves in the frequency range 5 Hz to            40 kHz like CONSERT and the flywheel should not be operated if            possible.            Detectors with PP-electrode attachments - APXS and MUPUS-PEN -            must not be powered while the respective attached PP-electrode is            used for PP active measurements.

For active measurements the SESAME software calculates the optimal            combination of a sine wave vector and a read-out frequency to             generate a frequency close to the commanded one.

urn:esa:psa:context:instrument:ro.rpclap,ROSETTA PLASMA CONSORTIUM - LANGMUIR PROBE for RO,ROSETTA PLASMA CONSORTIUM - LANGMUIR PROBE,"     Instrument Overview ===================   The Langmuir probe instrument (RPC-LAP) is part of the set of Rosetta orbiter instruments known as the Rosetta Plasma Consortium (RPC). The purpose of the LAP is to provide measurements of several plasma parameters in the parts of space visited by Rosetta, primarily the cometary environment. LAP uses two Langmuir probes to access primarily the following plasma parameters:   - Plasma (electron) density (ne) - Electron temperature (Te) - Spacecraft potential (Vsc) - Plasma drift speed (v) - Plasma fluctuations and waves up to 8 kHz (dn/n, E)   Not all parameters can be derived in all regions, and the methods for deriving a particular parameter can vary from region to region.   This catalog file gives a brief overview. For more details, please see the instrument description in Space Science Reviews (full reference at end of this file).     Scientific objectives =====================   1. By monitoring the development of plasma density, electron temperature and flow speed from the onset of cometary activity to the perihelion, LAP will significantly improve our view of cometary outgassing and the formation and structure of the cometary plasma environment.   2. By studying time and space variations of the fluid parameters of the inner coma, LAP will pave the way for a detailed understanding of this region, including the diamagnetic cavity where no in-situ observations have previously been made.   3. By its ability to measure plasma density structures, LAP can investigate dynamic features in the cometary environment that can be compared to and linked to comet surface events as observed by other Rosetta orbiter instruments.   4. By measuring density fluctuations and electric field variations from zero frequency up to 8~kHz, LAP will be able to investigate the stability and dynamics of the cometary plasma environment in different stages of cometary activity. This is of particular interest on and inside the contact surface (diamagnetic cavity boundary), which defines the inner limit of penetration of magnetic fields and plasma of solar wind origin into the cometary plasma environment.   5. By analysing LAP data together with data from other RPC instruments, it will be possible to investigate a broad range of problems no single RPC instrument could cover on its own. Examples are interactions between low frequency waves and plasma particles (LAP-ICA-IES), MHD waves and contact surface properties (LAP-MAG), and wave-wave interactions (LAP-MIP).       Measurement principles ======================   A spherical Langmuir probe is a conceptually simple device, but is nevertheless able to provide data on a multitude of plasma parameters. The use of two probes extends these possibilities further, particularly when coupled to versatile electronics. LAP implements several measurement principles:   - Bias voltage sweeps: yields ne and Te in dense (a few hundred   electrons per cm3 and more) plasmas; photoemission saturation   current in tenuous plasmas (below a few hundred cm-3); spacecraft   potential (actually spacecraft-to-probe potential) in all plasmas. - Probe current variations: yields plasma density fluctuations (dn/n)   in dense plasmas; electric field variations in low density plasmas. - Electric fields and spacecraft potential: Yields spacecraft potential,   from which the plasma density can be derived in low density plasmas,   and electric wave fields.   For a full description of the measurement modes, see the published instrument descriptions ERIKSSON2007A and ERIKSSON2008A, provided in the DOCUMENT directory.

urn:esa:psa:context:instrument:ro.rpcmag,ROSETTA PLASMA CONSORTIUM - FLUXGATE MAGNETOMETER for RO,ROSETTA PLASMA CONSORTIUM - FLUXGATE MAGNETOMETER,"     Instrument Overview ===================     The ROSETTA orbiter magnetometer (RPCMAG)is part of the ROSETTA Plasma Consortium (RPC) set of Scientific instruments. The purpose of the magnetometer is the measurement of the interplanetary magnetic field close to different targets visited by the ROSETTA spacecraft.       Science Objectives of the Investigation ======================================= + Measurements of the interplanetary magnetic field during the flybys   at planet Mars & Earth, the asteroids and in the environment of   comet 67p/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. + Study of the structure and dynamics of the cometary-solar wind   interaction region. + Study of the generation and evolution of the cometary magnetic   Cavity. + Study of cometary tail evolution and structure.       The Cometary Magnetic Field - A historical perspective ======================================================   In 1951 the German Astronomer Ludwig Biermann used the fact that cometary tails are always pointing away from the Sun to postulate the solar wind. It was Hannes Alfven who suggested in 1957 that cometary tails are due to the draping of the interplanetary magnetic field around the cometary nucleus. To explain this draping effect C.S. Wu and R.C. Davidson in 1972 studied the pick-up of cometary ions and the associated mass loading of the solar wind. Associated strong plasma wave turbulence due to this mass loading was first detected by B.T. Tsurutani and E.J. Smith in 1986.   The magnetic field draping itself was first measured by F. M. Neubauer and co-workers using magnetic field measurements made onboard the GIOTTO s/c.

According to the performed continuous magnetic   mappings of all units and s/c magnetic system modelling the expected   magnetic field at the OB sensor is about 45nT (without boom motor   field). + MAG will see some stray fields from other units like: Reaction   Wheels, Solar Panel Motor and Thruster firing. This needs to be   monitored during flight, especially during switch on procedures, for   purposes of inflight calibration.     History of the Instrument - Design Changes ==========================================   The magnetometer experiment came on board of ROSETTA in a very late phase of the project. For this reason the mechanical (mass) and electrical requirements (power) were extremely stringent: mass below 1kg, power below 1W! In addition the project mass budget went negative after few months so that the project had to run general descoping actions to reduce mass. The first mass reduction action did not safe enough mass, so a second run had to be made. This led to severe descopings on the magnetometer sensors and electronics whose mass was already in the margin of the other experiments: Actions:  + reduce size and mass of sensor,  + integrate small micro-D connector into sensor:    as a result the MAG sensors are extremely small and have low mass    of 36g ! But due to this no access to tune the inner ring-cores for    low offset was possible anymore.  + The electronics board was reduced by 30% in size (from 1.5 boards    to 1 board only) and down to 1.5mm thickness of the big multilayer    board by higher integration. Connectors had to be changed from    cannon-D to micro-D. The higher integration and size reduction was    reached by new very dense layout and deletion of offset temperature    compensation circuit for all 6 sensor-axes !   This mass saving action later on during qualification (vibration of RPC-0) resulted in a dramatic failure of the MAG board where both ASICS (128 pins)lost several pins due to very high resonance peaks of the multilayer board. The rework and redesign took several weeks and could only be solved by increasing the stiffness of the board by adding (gluing) additional stiffeners on top and bottom side of the board thus adding several 100g of mass.   Comment: at this stage of the project the launcher has changed from          ARIANE 4 to 5 giving more mass for ROSETTA.         FGM  Location =============   Sensors : on Boom 1.5 m away from s/c to minimize s/c generated           noise/disturbances.           Distance  between Sensors : 15 cm           2 sensors for redundancy and to eliminate residual noise           from  s/c. Electronics: inside s/c in RPC-0 Box, common box for ALL RPC              electronics.       MAG Sensor - History ==================== The prototype of the ROSETTA FGM-sensors have been successfully flown onboard the DS-1 s/c.   Design Changes: Due to the extreme boom temperature it became necessary to change the MAG sensors baseplate from isolating Glassfibre to Carbonfibre which has a much better thermal conductivity in order to get rid of the internal 25mW drive power for each sensor. Without this change, each sensor would heat up much higher then expected.       MAG Sensor: Characteristics ===========================   Excitation Coil: 1 layer CuL, completely wounded on  ring core                  Core material: Permalloy (Fe19Ni81)   Pickup Coil:     2*129 windings in 6 layers, 0.112 mm - High Temp. CuL                  Bobbin: Macor                          + glass ceramic                          + Ease of machining                          + maximum use temperature 800 deg C.                          + low thermal conductivity (1.46W/mK)                          + high temperature insulator (0.79kJ/kgK)                          + excellent electrical insulator                            (>10^16 Ohm/cm)                          + zero porosity (0%)                          + no outgassing in ultra high vacuum                          + strong and rigid                          + Coefficient of expansion:  7.4 x 10^-6/K   Housing:       Lexan                + Polycarbonate                + Excellent impact strength                + Good weatherability                + Ease of machining                + Thermoformability                + UV resisting                + flame retardancy                + light transmittance 86 %                + high thermal insulation       MAG Sensor: Features ==================== Sensor body consists of MACOR which has a smaller thermal Coefficient of expansion (7.4 x 10^-6/K) in comparison to the Copperwire (17  x 10^-6/K) of the windings.   As the copperwires are wound so tight on the MACOR body, the thermal Expansion of the copper does not play a role any more.   Both sensors are equipped with a temperature sensor PT1000 inside the housing to measure the sensor temperature.     A/D Converter CS5508 and Radiation Hardness =========================================== The ADC Crystal CS5508 was chosen by the Space Research Institute in Graz because of its good performance characteristics: + 20-Bits + very low power 3.72 mW + on chip self-calibration circuitry + extended temperature range.   The radiation behavior of the ADC was unknown. IWF Graz bought a special lot of this component and performed tests by using the facilities at ESTEC to determine the amount of radiation the converter could withstand and still remain within specification.   The CS 5508 total dose tolerance was found to be 27 krad. The devices showed high susceptibility to the Single Event Upset (SEU) as well as to the Single Event Latch-up (SEL). Additional Tantalum Metal Sheet (0.5mm) was used to shield the ADCs against irradiation during the mission period!   (comment: Tantalum is used because only mass saves from total dose           radiation, Tantalum has a specific density of  16.6g/cm^3!.           It must be mentioned that the glue of heavy Tantalum shields           on top of each ADC chip causes additional stress on the chip           pins during vibration, therefore the Tantalum spot shield           is also glued to the board on each small side.)   For detailed information refer to the document: RADIATIONHARDNESS TEST OF 20-bit CS5508 ADC CONVERTER, for RPC MAG/ROSETTA, Diploma Thesis, Amira Omerbegovic, F755 9530008 TU Graz, November 1999.     RPCMAG Frequency Plan =====================   RPCMAG needs 3 different frequencies which can all be derived from a single 4.194304 MHz oscillator by appropriate division within the FPGA:   FGM:  excitation signal 50 kHz & 12.5 kHz       4.194304 MHz / 84  = 49.93219 kHz  => 12.63345 kHz       The division is achieved by 84 = 26 +24 + 22   ADC:  drive frequency 32.768 kHz       4.194304 MHz / 128  = 33.768 kHz   Device clock for  1355 transceiver PIU I/f: 400 kHz +- 10%       4.194304 MHz / 10 = 419.439 kHz       Assumptions: Environmental ==========================   + Power supply:         Supply Voltage provided by PIU has to be stabilized within a         1% range   + Temperature:         Temperature changes are taken into account  by the calibration   + Radiation :         The ADCs are shielded by Tantalum plates (thickness: 0.5 mm)     Single Event Upsets (SEU)         These effects cause bitflips in memories, it can be protected         by failure correction algorithms (Hamming code) or redundancy.         For MAG an SEU event is uncritical because of full redundancy         and because a bitflip will cause the loss of one or few         vectors which can be tolerated.       Single Event Latch Up protection (SEL).         It was decided by the RPC team to have the latch up protection         (due to shortage and therefore overcurrent in some circuitry).         The circuitry is built from SEL immune parts in the central         RPC power unit, which in case of an SEL measures the         overcurrent (LCL) and turns off RPC within msec. Restart has         to be commanded.     Assumptions: Contingencies ========================== Critical parts:      + Every component has to be alive for a successful operation of the      FGM    + The ADCs are shielded by Tantalum plates    + PCB located in RPC-0 for shielding    + LCL protects electronics against short-circuits (located in PIU)   Possible MAG problems during flight are covered by the RPC-0 FMECA (Failure Mode Effectiveness and Criticality Analysis)       Assumptions: Redundancies =========================     + 2 sensors   + No redundancy for electronics       Design Margins ==============   The electronics design margins are standard workmanship questions for space application. Applicable to each part, especially capacitors.The design, therefore has been made according to ESA Standards as described in their documentation.   Critical parts are the:  + ADC  CS5508 wrt. Radiation (see above)  + MAX 400 Op Amp which is not on the preferred parts list of  ESA or    NASA, because it is not qualified yet. However, this part is used    in commercial industry since years in great numbers and thus    showing and demonstrating the quality level and reliability.       Operations ===========   The RPCMAG instrument has only two intrinsic modes:    + ON  + OFF     After power on reset, the MAG instrument calibrates itself and starts to send continuously 20 Hz Magnetic field (B) and Housekeeping (HK) Data. Filtering is done in the PIU.     MAG Instrument Software =======================   MAG software runs in a radiation hard 1280 FPGA! Detailed description of the ACTEL FPGA software can be found in the following document:    The building and operation of the MAG_FPGA in the Fluxgate  Magnetometer Electronics.   RPCMAG has no individual s/w. It has only the capability to be switched on/off and later it runs in continuous 20 Hz sampling mode. Calibration of the ADCs once in every 24 hour. It only samples and sends 20 Hz data (6 vectors + 1 HK). All other operation is done in PIU-S/W.     A RPCMAG Data Acquisition Cycle :   Using a crystal oscillator the MAG FPGA sends a 'StartConvert' signal (CONV)to the ADCs at a certain time. After all ADCs have been finished the conversion (RDY Signal) the data will be read and transmitted to the Link FPGA. As the 20 Hz of the MAG unit is slightly different from the 20 Hz at the s/c there will be not an integral number of vectors in an RPC AQP. Therefore, the CONV signal is passed  to the Link chip (CONV1) to send a signal to the PIU. PIU will then generate a high res time stamp for the first vector of the packet. The accuracy is better then 1ms +- 100 us.     MAG  Software in PIU ==================== PIU is just an observer. It has no control of what MAG is doing. The MAG S/W in the PIU has the task to  + synchronize itself with the MAGs internal conversion signal  + sample all 20 Hz Mag data without any loose and store on board time    for the first value of the packet  + prepare science and HK packets for transmission  + filter the 20 Hz data to an appropriate mean value and set MAG to    the right SID  + switch the desired sensor to be primary  + handle FCPs for MAG  + provide HK values, measured by the MAG ADC, for  PIU, MAG, MIP       Mode description: =================   MODE               SAMPLE   PACKET    PACKET      VECTOR                    RATE     PERIOD    LENGTH      RATE   Minimum Mode SID1  1/32 Hz  1024 s    32 Pri Vec   0.03125 vec/s                                        1 Sec Vec  0.000976 vec/s Normal Mode  SID2     1 Hz    32 s    32 Pri Vec         1 vec/s                                        1 Sec Vec   0.03125 vec/s Burst  Mode  SID3    20 Hz    16 s   320 Pri Vec        20 vec/s                                       16 Sec Vec         1 vec/s Medium Mode  SID4     5 Hz    32 s   160 Pri Vec         5 vec/s                                        1 Sec Vec   0.03125 vec/s Low Mode     SID5  0.25 Hz   128 s    32 Pri Vec      0.25 vec/s                                        1 Sec Vec  0.007812 vec/s Test Mode    SID6    20 Hz    16 s   320 Pri Vec        20 vec/s                                        1 Sec Vec    0.0625 vec/s HK Mode                       32 s       8 words   0.03125 vec/s     Filter S/W ===========   Burst data (SID3) pass the s/w unfiltered.

Each vector coming out of the PIU gets a specific time stamp according to the actual mode. These time stamps are shifted towards the real time of the physical event. The time stamps of the data lie BEFORE the real measurement time. This time displacement for the  PRIMARY vectors in  different modes is listed in the following table:   MODE          SAMPLE RATE    TIME SHIFT (PRIMARY VECTORS) Minimum SID1  1/32 Hz        223.7  s Normal  SID2     1 Hz          8.2  s Burst   SID3    20 Hz          0    s Medium  SID4     5 Hz          1.35 s Low     SID5  0.25 Hz         27.7  s   Thus, the true time of the physical event is achieved by adding the listed time shift to the time stamp of the vector.   For the SECONDARY vectors a different time stamping applies. As the SECONDARY vectors are not filtered but just picked out of the data stream. Thus, the first SECONDARY vector of a packet is stamped with the time of the end of the data  packet. Therefore, the following shifts have to be taken into account:     MODE          SAMPLE RATE    TIME SHIFT (SECONDARY VECTORS) Minimum SID1  1/1024 Hz       1023.95 s Normal  SID2    1/32 Hz         31.95 s Burst   SID3       1 Hz         15.95 s Medium  SID4    1/32 Hz         31.95 s Low     SID5   1/128 Hz        127.95 s     The archive data in the datasets labeled with V1.0 use the original times tamps. For later datasets labeled V2.0 and above the time stamps of the PRIMARY vectors have been corrected by the archive generation software. The SECONDARY vector time stamps, however,  stay always as they were originally transmitted in the telemetry.     Sensors extreme Temperature Tests =================================   The MAG sensors on the boom will see extreme Temperatures from -200 deg C to +150 deg C. This Temperature range for the sensors could only be tested in the Cryo-Mumetal chamber of Garchy (France), where the Magnetic field is completely shielded by Mumetal. A non Magnetic Test Table inside can be cooled by liquid Nitrogen to -191 deg C. This test was performed successfully with all sensors in January 2001. The extreme temperature range was predicted for comet Wirtanen orbit, a new prediction for the CG target does will probably be similar. In Magnetsrode the positive temperature range was tested & calibrated up to +75 deg C. However, it is impossible to test the sensors in non magnetic environment and thermal Vacuum, no facility for this exists worldwide.     EMC Test ========   The magnetic field is more or less distorted by the following s/c units:     Reaction wheels   Solar Arrays (<0.5 nT)   SADM (23 nT)   Lander   Thrusters (compensated)         Calibration ===========   The magnetometer has been calibrated on ground in the magnetic coil facility MAGNETSRODE at Braunschweig, Germany. This facility is operated by the Institute of Geophysics and extraterrestrial Physics.   The complete calibration is documented in the following documents:     Report:                             RO-IGM-TR-0002   DC-Analysis:                        RO-IGM-TR-0003   AC-Analysis:                        RO-IWF-TR-0001     Step by Step Calibration Procedure: RO-IGEP-TR-00028     Nominal (uncalibrated) Conversion of Digital values =================================================== 1)Science Data: Magnetic field values (range = +-15000nT , 20 Bit):     B_max  = +15000 nT   B_min  = -15000 nT   counts = 2^20  = 1048576   Nominal_Factor = (B_max - B_min) / counts     The binary values of the 20 bit ADC Output are in the range   of 00000h : FFFFFh corresponding to decimal values of 0 : (counts-1)   As the ADC is operated in bipolar mode the nominal relation between   counts and magnetic field is as follows:   00000h <->  B_min   80000h <->  0   FFFFFh <->  B_max     The conversion routine from binary TM data to ASCII Rawdata converts   the binary values to signed integers in the following way   00000h -> -counts/2   80000h ->  0   FFFFFh -> +counts/2   These signed integers in the range from -counts/2 to +counts/2 are   the EDITED RAW DATA.Unit is [counts].

To convert these into voltages, the following algorithm is applied:         U= [ADCvalue + counts/2] *  Nominal_Factor  + V_min   [V]     Also the nominal temperatures are computed from HK voltages in a similar way Some voltage are monitored as 8bit values; the conversion, however, is done in the same way.

urn:esa:psa:context:instrument:ro.rsi,ROSETTA RADIO SCIENCE INVESTIGATION for RO,ROSETTA RADIO SCIENCE INVESTIGATION,"The Rosetta Orbiter radio science investigations will use the existing radio transmitters and receivers on the orbiter. There are three primary investigations in addition to the routine tracking which takes place for navigation and data return and will be used in conjunction with other experiments. The gravity mapping campaign will use Doppler and range tracking to estimate the mass and gravity field of the comet nucleus. The occultation experiments will study the effects of the innermost coma on radio signals which pass through the coma to Earth before and after occultations of the comet nucleus and will also help determine the morphology of the nucleus. Finally, bistatic radar observations will be used to study the surface of the comet by pointing the high-gain antenna at the nucleus and bouncing the signals off the surface towards Earth, where the forward-reflected signal will reveal properties of the surface such as the roughness and dielectric constant. The primary scientific objectives of the investigations are 1) to determine the mass, bulk density, gravity field, moment of inertia, spin state, orbit, lightshift, and thermal properties of the nucleus; 2) determine the size and shape of the nucleus; 3) determine the dielectric constant and roughness of the surface of the nucleus; 4) Profile the distribution of mm-dm size particles and the plasma content of the coma; 5) aid in determination of the dust and gas flux; and 6) determine asteroid mass and bulk density during flybys.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
urn:esa:psa:context:instrument:ro.virtis,VISIBLE AND INFRARED THERMAL IMAGING SPECTROMETER for RO,VISIBLE AND INFRARED THERMAL IMAGING SPECTROMETER,"       Instrument Overview   ===================    VIRTIS stands for Visible Infra Red Thermal Imaging    Spectrometer, and is part of the ROSETTA orbiter payload. The    VIRTIS instrument [CORADINIETAL2007] combines a double capability:    (1) high-resolution visible and infrared imaging in the 0.25-5    micron range at moderate spectral resolution (VIRTIS-M channel)    and (2) high-resolution spectroscopy in the 2-5 micron range    (VIRTIS-H channel). The two channels observe the same areas in    combined modes to take full advantage of their complementarities.    VIRTIS-M (named -M in the following) is characterised by a single    optical head consisting of a Shafer telescope combined with an    Offner imaging spectrometer and by two bidimensional FPAs: the    VIS (0.25-1 micron) and IR (1-5 micron). VIRTIS-H (-H) is a    high-resolution infrared cross-dispersed spectrometer using a    prism and a grating. The 2-5 micron spectrum is dispersed in 9    orders on a focal-plane detector array.        Technical Description    =====================       The instrument is divided into 4 separate modules: the       Optics Module - which houses the two -M and -H optical       heads and the Stirling cycle cryocoolers used to cool the       IR detectors to 70 K -, the two Proximity Electronics       Modules (PEM) required to drive the two optical heads,       the Main Electronics Module - which contains the Data       Handling and Support Unit, for the data storage and       processing, the power supply and control electronics of       the cryocoolers and the power supply for the overall       instrument.      Proximity Electronics Modules Description    -----------------------------------------       Each optical head requires specific electronics to drive the       CCD, the two IRFPAs, the covers, the thermal control; the       PEMs are two small boxes interfaced directly to the S/C and       placed in the vicinity of the Optics Module to minimize       interference noise.      Optics Module Description    -------------------------       The -M imaging spectrometer and the -H echelle spectrometer       optical heads are located inside the Optics Module, which in       turn is divided into two regions thermally insulated from each       other by means of MultiLayer Insulation (MLI): the Cold Box       and the Pallet. The Pallet is mechanically and thermally       connected to the SpaceCraft; inside the Pallet are located the       two Stirling cycle cryocoolers. The heat produced by the       cryocoolers compressors (a maximum of  24 W in closed loop       mode) is dissipated to the spacecraft. The Cold Box contains       the two optical heads and its main function is to act as a       thermal buffer between the Optical Heads, working at 130 K,       and the external environment (the S/C temperature ranges from       250 to 320 K). The Cold Box is mechanically connected to the       Pallet through 8 Titanium rods, whose number and size were       selected to minimize conductive heat loads and to avoid       distorsion upon cooling from room temperature. The structural       part of the cold box is a ledge which is supported by the 8       titanium rods; on the ledge the two optical heads are       mechanically fixed. Thermal insulation of the Cold Box is       improved by means of MLI, while thermal dissipation from the       Cold Box is achieved by means of a two stage passive radiator:       the first stage keeps the Cold Box temperature in the range       120-140 K, while the second stage is splitted in two parts,       one for each optical head, and allows to reach the required       130 K. Another important component of the instrument are the       two covers; they provide a double function: protection against       dust contamination, internal calibration by means of an       internally reflecting surface finish. They use a step motor and       their operation is controlled by the PEMs.       VIRTIS-M Description     --------------------       The VIRTIS-M optical head perfectly matches a Shafer telescope       to an Offner grating spectrometer to disperse a line image       across two FPAs. The Shafer telescope produces an anastigmatic       image, while Coma is eliminated by putting the aperture stop       near the center of curvature of the primary mirror and thus       making the telescope monocentric. The result is a telescope       system that relies only on spherical mirrors yet remains       diffraction limited over an appreciable spectrum and field: at       +/- 1.8 degrees the spot diameters are less than 6 microns in       diameter, which is 7 times smaller than the slit width.       The Offner grating spectrometer allows to cover the visible       and IR ranges by realising, on a single grating substrate,       two concentric separate regions having different groove       densities: the central one, approximately covering 30% of the       grating area is devoted to the visible spectrum, while the       external region is used for the IR range. The IR region has a       larger area as the reflected infrared solar irradiance is quite       low and is not adequately compensated by the infrared emissions       of the cold comet.       The visible region of the grating is laminar with rectangular       grooves profile, and the groove density is 268 grooves/mm.       Moreover, to compensate for the low solar energy and low CCD       quantum efficiency in the ultra-violet and near infrared       regions, two different groove depths have been used to modify       the spectral efficiency of the grating. The resulting       efficiency improves the instrument's dynamic range by       increasing the S/N at the extreme wavelengths and preventing       saturation in the central wavelengths.       Since the infrared channel does not require as high a       resolution as the visible channel, the lower MTF caused by the       visible zone's obscuration of the infrared pupil is acceptable;       the groove density is 54 grooves/mm. In any case, the spot       diagrams for all visible and infrared wavelengths at all field       positions are within the dimension of a 40 microns pixel. For       the infrared zones, a blazed groove profile is used that results       in a peak efficiency at 5 micron to compensate for the low       signal levels expected at this wavelength.       VIRTIS-H Description     --------------------       In -H the light is collected by an  off-axis parabola and then       collimated by another  off-axis  parabola before  entering a       cross-dispersing prism made by  Lithium Fluoride. After exiting       the prism the light is diffracted by a flat reflection grating       which disperses in a direction perpendicular to the prism       dispersion. The prism allows the low groove density grating,       which is the echelle element of the spectrometer, to achieve       very high spectral resolution by  separating orders 9 through       13 across a two-dimensional detector array: the spectral       resolution varies in each order between 1200 and 3500. Since       the -H is not an imaging channel, it is only required to achieve       good optical performance at the zero field position. The focal       length of the objective is set by the required IFOV and the       number of pixels allowed for summing. While the telescope is       F/1.6, the objective is F/1.67 and requires five pixels to be       summed in the spatial direction to achieve a 1 mrad2 IFOV (5 x       .45 mrad x .45 mrad).       Main Electronics Module Description     -----------------------------------       The Main Electronics is physically separated from the Optics       Module. It houses the Power supply for all the experiment, the       cooler electronics, the Spacecraft interface electronics, for       telemetry and telecommanding, the interfaces with the Optics       Module subsystems, and the DHSU (Data Handling and Support       Unit) which is the electronics for the data handling,       processing and for the instrument control.       The data processing and the data handling activities into the       DHSU are performed using an on-line philosophy. The data are       processed and transferred to the spacecraft in real time. The       mass memory (SSR) of the spacecraft is used to store or buffer       a large data volume. The Main Electronics contains no       additional hardware component for data processing and       compression. All data processing is performed by software.         Scientific requirements and activity in the mission phases   ==========================================================          A summary of the scientific requirements needed to define the      characteristics of VIRTIS is given hereafter.      Nucleus science objectives:      1- Identification of different ices and ice mixtures and         determination of their spatial distribution. This must be         done in spite of the very low albedo ( <  0.1), due to dark         inclusions present in the ice and the resulting weak ice         spectral features, as well as at large distances from the Sun         during some phases of the mission.      2- Identification of the carbonaceous materials that probably are         mixed with water ice, even in low percentages (<20%). The         associated spectral features will be very subdued and their         identification, from their shape and centre, will require         high S/N (>100).  It will be important also to determine the         overall continuum slopes of the spectra, for the  presence of         organic compounds will redden the spectra in diagnostic ways         between 0.4 and 1.1 ?m and into the IR as well.     3-  Determination of the physical microstructure and nature         of the surface grains by measuring the spectrophotometric         phase curve with a relative radiometric accuracy of about 1-%.         Identification of the silicates, hydrates and other minerals         which are expected to be found. Strong but broad absorption         features should be observed from the visible (0.25-1.0 micron)         to the near IR (1.0-5.0 micron), so a spectral resolution of         100 is adequate.     4-  Determination of the spatial distribution of the various         mineralogical types and their mixtures using both the         spectral features and the overall brightness.  Local         fluctuations of the reflectivity and spectral features         related to small scale compositional differences are         expected. For global mapping of the nucleus, a spatial         resolution of a few tens of metres is needed.     5-  Detection and monitoring of active areas on the comet         surface (cryo-volcanism) to understand the physical processes         operating and to identify the material types associated.         Determination of the composition of ices on the nucleus         surface. With the exception of H2O, condensed molecules         display diagnostic narrow (as well as broad) absorption bands         in the reflected component (1-3 micron). S/N  higher than 100         and a minimum resolving power of 1000 is needed to resolve         the bands fully. The -H FOV must be within the field of view         of one -M frame (accuracy of few arcminutes) to allow combined         operation at both high spatial  and spectral resolution.     Coma science objectives:       1-  Determination of the global distribution of gas and dust         in the inner coma. Radiometric accuracy of 10% absolute and         1% relative with a resolving power of 100 are required.     2-  Identification and mapping of the strong molecular         emissions in the near ultraviolet and visible portions of the         spectrum. These include the main water dissociation product         OH (0.28 and 0.31 micron), CN, C3, NH, CH and CO+ ions, and         the neutral radicals CN and C2. The combination of high         spatial resolution with moderate spectral resolution will         allow correlation of the evolution of radicals with that of         their parent molecules.     3-  Mapping of the composition and evolution of gas and dust         jets in the coma and comparison  with the mineralogical         composition and spatial morphology of active regions on the         surface of the nucleus.     4-  Determination of  the composition of the dust grains in the         coma by observing emission features in the fundamental bands         between 2.5-5 micron. These emissions will be observed mainly         at the end of the mission, at distances from the Sun of less         than 2 AU.     5-  Identification of the gas molecules. The 2-5 micron range         corresponds to the maximum efficiency of molecular resonant         fluorescence at fundamental rotational/vibrational bands. A         major objective is to identify the hydrocarbon emission in         the  3-4 micron range. Such identification requires a         resolving power of the order of 2000 at 3.5 micron.     6-  Assessment of the coma thermodynamic with the         determination  and mapping the rotational temperatures for the         individual lines of H2O with an accuracy of 1 K and a nominal         S/N of 200.     7-  Detection of early gaseous activity: Spectra will be         obtained at long integration times, starting before the         mapping phase, to search for CO emission as an indicator of         beginning activity. Determination of ortho/para ratio for H2O.         Long integration should allow a determination of the OPR with         a S/N ratio of 50 to discriminate among different scenarios         of comet formation.     8-  Determination of isotopic ratios for selected molecules,         such as 13CO, H217O, H218O or HDO.           Calibration measurements   ========================          Before the integration of the VIRTIS experiment aboard Rosetta,        a full calibration of the instrument was performed to        completely characterize the instrumental performances.        The fundamental calibrations necessary to correctly retrieve        the scientific information from VIRTIS data are:     1- Geometric calibration: measurement of IFOV, FOV and in field        distorsions;     2- Spectral calibration: correlation between spectral dispersion        axis of the focal planes with wavelength;     3- Spatial calibration: evaluation of the flat-field matrices        necessary to homogenize the focal planes responses;     4- Radiometric calibration: determination of the Instrument        Transfer Function (ITF), that allows to convert digital numbers        (DN) in physical units of spectral radiance (W m-2 micron-1        sterad-1).        These quantities, continuously checked during the flight at        each switch on of the experiment, are used in the data        pipeline before the scientific analysis.

urn:esa:psa:context:instrument:uly.cospin-at,COSPIN-ANISOTROPY TELESCOPE for ULY,COSPIN-ANISOTROPY TELESCOPE,"       (the following descriptions are excerpted from   [SIMPSONETAL1992A])     Instrument Overview   ===================     The ATs sensor unit consists of two, identical charged-     particle telescopes, each with a geometrical factor of 0.75     cm^2 sr, whose role is to measure the three-dimensional     charged-particle distribution in the energy ranges 0.7 to 2.2     MeV for Z >= 1, 2.2 to 6.5 MeV for protons, and 3.1 to 23.0 MeV     for Z >= 2.  The three dimensional distribution measurements     are achieved by inclining the two telescopes at independent     angles (AT1 at 145[deg.] and AT2 at 60[deg.]) to the spin axis     of the spacecraft and sectoring (8 sectors) the data outputs of     the telescopes during each spin.       Detectors   =========     The AT unit, which is situated at the top of the SIM-1 package,     comprises two telescopes, each with independent electronics     systems.  [Each telescope] consists of a stack of three     semiconductor silicon surface-barrier detectors surrounded by a     passive aluminum collimator shield which defines the 70 deg.     full-opening angle of the telescope.  The front detector has a     nominal thickness of 30 [micro]m and a sensitive area of 2.0     cm^2, while detectors B and C are each of thickness 300     [micro]m and have areas of 4.5 cm^2 each.       The exposed surface of the front detector has an evaporated     layer of aluminium of 60 [micro]m/cm^2 on it to reduce optical     sensitivity, and has an 8 micron thick foil of aluminized     kapton over it to eliminate optical effects and provide     physical protection.  It also eases the thermal balance     problems of the telescope.  All three detectors are operated at     depletion voltage plus 50% to minimize radiation damage     effects.       The C detector is operated in anti-coincidence with the A and B     detectors and therefore provides active shielding over the     reverse cone of the telescope.  The forward acceptance cones of     the telescopes are defined by the passive aluminium collimator     shield which imposes a minimum low energy cut-off of 20 MeV for     protons and 1.35 MeV for electrons.  This reduces contamination     of the energy channels to < 10% for an omni-directional E^-2     differential spectrum, which is reasonable at these low     energies.  Should a differential spectrum of E^-1 be observed     at energies below ~ 100 MeV, a contamination correction may be     necessary.       Inside the collimator are a series of matt black anodized     baffles to reduce scattered sunlight and to scatter away     energetic electrons which could be reflected onto the front     detector.  The electron and proton responses of the telescope     are discussed below.       Electronics   ===========     The outputs of the 3 detectors are combined to define a series     of energy channels.  There are two specific features that need     to be commented on.  One is the In-Flight Test Generator (IFTG)     and the other is the Reconfiguration Logic.  The IFTG can be     activated by command to produce a series of pulses which check     the functioning and stability of the discriminator levels via     the amplifier chain.  It has an automatic switch-off mode as     well as a commanded-off mode.  The Reconfiguration Logic is     designed to minimize the effects of possible electronic     failures during the long time scale of the Ulysses mission, and     permits some modification of the channel logics.  Since the A1     discriminator plays a key role in enabling the logic, if it     should fail its role is automatically assumed by the A2     discriminator, albeit at the trigger level of A2.  As a part of     the independent electronics chains, each telescope has an     independent command-receive system.       The purpose of the digital data system is to organize the data     suitably prior to it being read into the CPU.  [In] essence,     during any one spin of spacecraft the data are routed into the     appropriate one of the eight equiangular sector accumulators,     and a data sample is composed of an integral number of     spacecraft spins.  Thus the data-collection time corresponds to     this integral number of spin periods and is asynchronous with     the (fixed) telemetry sampling rate.  The data system deals     with this problem by suitably adjusting the integral number of     spins per sample period to remain 'in-step' overall with the     telemetry sampling period.       This system is used to give some of the energy channels both     spin averaged and sectored outputs.  The sampling times shown     are the average sampling periods, since the actual sampling     periods corresponding to an integral number of spin periods.     The sectoring for the Z >= 2 (3.1 to 7.2 MeV) channel is     reduced to quadrants to reflect the expected lower counting     rates at these energies.       After processing by the data system, the data for each     telescope is routed by its independent interface to one of the     two processing units in the CPU for processing into the COSPIN     data format.  In contrast to other data channels in COSPIN,     each AT is served exclusively by one of the redundant CPUs in     the DPU.       Calibration   ===========     The electron response of the front detector of a telescope is     minimized by the use of a thin detector and a high     discriminator level (equivalent to 300 keV) for channel A1.     The 30 micron detector corresponds to an effective range for an     electron of 66 keV.  The 300 keV discriminator can only be     triggered by a 5-fold 'pile-up' effect at this energy, or by     electron 'straggle' effects of electrons of 300 keV.     Calculation indicates that a 30 micron detector has an     efficiency of < 10^-3 for 300 keV electrons.  This is     compatible with electron accelerator tests using 200 to 400 keV     electrons from the Van de Graaf accelerator at Harwell which     indicate a detection efficiency of ~ 2 x 10^-5 at these     energies.       Additional electron accelerator tests have been done on the     electron accelerator at the Herzberg Institute in Ottawa.     These were performed at an energy of 65 keV to try to measure     'pile- up' effects for electrons just coming to rest in the     front detector.  Interpretation of these results has proved     complex, and a computer simulation of the electronics system is     being used to produce a model that relates observed rates to     actual rates.  This is obviously an important tool for     interpreting results during the Jupiter fly-by.       To calibrate channels A1 to A4 for particles with Z >= 1, tests     were done on the IBIS accelerator at AERE, Harwell, which gave     protons up to 3 MeV.  The minimum beam energy obtainable was     0.65 Mev.  The 'mid-point' energies of the measured thresholds     have been used to define the energy ranges given in Table 5.     The differences between calculated and measured values were     small and above 2 MeV the measured edge agreed with calculated     value.       Pre-launch calibration and test of the AT amplifiers was done     using calibrated test generators, and the amplifiers are     checked using the IFTG discussed above.       In-flight Performance   =====================     The instrument performance since switch-on has been good.  The     highest background counting rate, due to system noise, RTG     induced counts and the cosmic ray background is in channel 1     (0.7 to 0.9 MeV, Z >= 1), and corresponds to 0.05 particles     cm^-2 sr^-1 s^-1 for either AT1 or AT2.  The background rates     in the other channels are between a factor of 1.7 to 6 less     than this.  Overall the AT telescopes are providing     satisfactory performance.       During [a] solar particle event starting on day 296, 1990, once     particle isotropy had been established, the spin averaged     counting rates observed by the two telescopes tracked each     other closely.  Similarly the spin averaged energy spectra and     sectored counting rates also compared closely.  This is also     true of the other events observed.       Of more interest is the behavior during the initial stages of     an event.  Figure 14 shows the sectored counting rates at a     time when the particle intensity was still rising.  AT2     (looking sunward, in the direction of the spin axis) saw a     markedly anisotropic distribution and a significantly higher     intensity than telescope AT1 (viewing 'backscattered'     particles) which saw a lower intensity, largely isotropic     distribution.  For proton spectra derived from a fit to the     integrated fluxes in the energy ranges of the AT channels,     neither a power law nor an exponential in energy gives a good     fit for this event.

urn:esa:psa:context:instrument:uly.cospin-het,COSPIN-HIGH ENERGY TELESCOPE for ULY,COSPIN-HIGH ENERGY TELESCOPE,"       (description excerpted from [SIMPSONETAL1992A])     Instrument Overview   ===================     The high energy telescope (HET) is a large geometric factor     cosmic ray telescope that uses particle trajectory     determination together with the dE/dX vs.  residual E technique     to measure the energy and identify the mass and charge of     cosmic rays.  The HET with its analogue and digital electronics     forms the largest part of SIM2, with the HFT, mounted on top.     Detectors D[1]-D[6] provide signals that allow determination of     the trajectory of the incident particle, and detectors K[1]-     K[6] provide accurate measurement of the energy loss rates and     total energy of particles which stop in the K detectors.  For     particles which stop in the detector stack, the telescope     provides charge and mass resolution sufficient for studies of     the chemical and isotopic composition of cosmic rays from     hydrogen through nickel (1 >= Z >= 28).       Scientific Objectives   =====================     Through measurements of the intensity and chemical and isotopic     composition of nucleonic cosmic rays with energies of order 10     through a few hundred MeV/nucleon, the telescope provides data     relevant to a number of important questions in heliospheric and     galactic cosmic ray physics, including acceleration of     particles in solar flares, the nature of solar modulation, the     structure of the heliospheric modulation region, the     characteristics of the interstellar medium, conditions in the     acceleration region itself, and results of nucleosynthesis in     supernovae.  In addition, the telescope provides measurements     of electrons with energies of a few MeV for investigation of     the propagation of solar and Jovian electrons throughout the     heliosphere.       Detectors   =========     Detectors D[1]-D[6] are multi-strip position sensitive Li-     drifted silicon solid state detectors that measure both the     energy loss in the detector and the location (by strip number)     of the cosmic ray trajectory through the detector.  The     detectors were developed and fabricated at the University of     Chicago (Lamport et al., Nucl. Instr.  and Meth.  134, 71,     1976), and are operated at a bias voltage of 35 volts.  The     electrical contacts on the front surface of the detector     consist of evaporated gold strips which are individually     connected to a resistive divider chain on the detector ring,     one end of which is connected to ground.  On the back surface,     a single evaporated aluminum contact covers the entire     sensitive area of the detector.  Thus, two signals are derived     from each detector.  The signal from the back surface (E     signal) measures the total energy lost in the detector, while     the signal from the front surface (P signal) is proportional to     the location along the resistive divider chain of the strip in     which the charge was collected.  The position resolution     achieved by this technique in the individual detectors is     approximately 150 microns.  With the strips of successive     detectors (e.g., D[1], D[2], D[3]) rotated by 60 [deg.], the     trajectory of incident cosmic rays can be determined to an     accuracy of better than 1 [deg.], as verified by accelerator     calibration.  Furthermore, use of three detectors in both the     front (D[1]-D[3]) and back (D[4]-D[6]) planes provides a viable     position-sensing backup in case one of the detectors fails     during the mission.       Detectors K[1]-K[6] are thick (nominal 5 mm) Li-drift silicon     detectors that, in combination, provide approximately 7 g cm^-2     for stopping incident cosmic rays.  Detectors K[1]-K[6] were     supplied by the Lawrence Berkely Laboratory, and detectors K[5]     and K[6] were supplied by the Kevex corporation.  The K[1]-K[6]     detectors are operated at a bias of 650 volts, which provides     better than 99.5% charge collection within the amplifier     shaping time constant of 5 microseconds.  Anticoincidence     protection for the telescope is provided by a scintillator     shield (S) surrounding the telescope, and by a solid state     detector, A, which identifies particles which completely     penetrate the telescope.       Electronics   ===========     Signals from the front and back surfaces of D[1]-D[6] and from     K[1]-K[6] (18 signals in all) are fed through charge-sensitive     amplifiers and two sets of shaping post-amplifiers.  Signals     from K[1]-K[6] and the E signals from D[1]-D[6] are fed to a     fast (1 microsecond shaping time constant) set of amplifiers to     provide inputs for discriminators which, through the digital     logic, are used to identify the particle type for counting     rates and to set logic flags.  In parallel, all 18 detector     signals are fed to a slower (5 microsecond rise to maximum)     dual-gain set of amplifiers which provide shaped signals for     accurate amplitude measurement by the pulse height analysis     circuitry.  Gains for the dual-gain amplifiers are selected     based on signal size as determined by discriminators operated     off the differentiated rise of the charge-sensitive amplifier     signal.  To maintain the accuracy required for isotopic     resolution through iron, the amplifiers in the PHA chain have     been designed for extreme stability, and tests have     demonstrated a drift in gain of < 0.007%/[deg.]C over the     temperature range -20[deg.]C to +23[deg.] C.  Gains and     thresholds are monitored by an in-flight calibration sequence     which is normally performed monthly, initiated by ground     command.       If the combination of fired discriminators satisfies one of the     logic conditions required for pulse-height analysis, output     from the amplifiers goes to two peak-detector/sample-hold     circuits that hold the signal amplitudes for processing by two     4096 channel (12 bit) analogue to digital converters, each of     which processes 9 of the signals.  Total processing time for a     complete event is approximately 2 ms.  The pulse height     analysis data for an individual event consists of 280 bits     containing the 18 pulse height analyses described above and 64     flag bits describing the state of discriminators attached to     the individual detectors, the command state of the instrument,     and the spin phase, divided into 8 sectors, at the time that     the event was detected.  Six HET PHA events are recorded during     each spacecraft telemetry format period, or 32 seconds at the     nominal bit rate.       Since the actual event rate in the telescope is much higher     than can be returned as PHA data with the available telemetry,     the PHA can only sample the events recorded by the telescope.     To maximize the scientific return from the PHA sample, three     priority levels have been established to govern selection of     events for retention in the PHA sample.  The levels correspond,     roughly, to heavy nuclei which stop in the telescope (P[1]), to     any particle which stops in the telescope without triggering     the anti-coincidence after penetrating at least to detector     D[4] (P[2]), and to any nucleonic particle which triggers     detectors D[1] and D[2] but not detectors A and S (P[3a]), or,     with a 50% duty cycle, to any particle which triggers D[1],     D[2], and D[4] (P[3b]).  P[3b] includes both high energy     penetrating particles and background events.  P[3] is the     lowest priority, and any P[3] event can be displaced by a P[2]     or P[1] event.  Similarly, any P[2] event can be displaced by a     P[1] event.  In quiet times since turn-on of the HET, about 40%     of the events have been of type P[3], and of the order of 1%     have been of type P[1].       In addition to pulse height analysis, the HET provides 29     digital counting rates.  Of these 13 are derived by logic from     the discriminators to correspond to electrons, protons, and     heavy nuclei in well defined energy ranges.  The counting rates     are true spin averages, with accumulation intervals of an     integral number of spins, as determined by the software of the     data processing unit.  Two counting rates provide 8 sectored     anisotropy information for protons and electrons, while the     remaining 14 counting rates monitor the counting rates of     individual detectors as a housekeeping function.  The     characteristics of the counting rates are more fully described     in Table 7 (below).  Energy ranges are based on computations     from range energy tables for nucleons.  All counting rates are     telemetered to earth in 27 --> 12 bit compressed format.       Because of the duration of the mission, the possibility of a     detector failure must be considered.  Consequently a number of     commands have been implemented to allow reconfiguration of the     telescope logic to compensate for failure of one or more     detectors.  The telescope logic is fully protected to the     extent that every term in the logic can be modified in a     predetermined way by ground command.  In addition, there are     commands to turn off high voltage supplies, to initiate (and     turn off) the in- flight calibrate sequence, and to control     power to three small heaters mounted in the analogue     electronics of the HET to help maintain a stable thermal     environment throughout the mission.       Calibration   ===========     The HET unit now on the Ulysses spacecraft was tested on     several occasions from 1982 - 1989 using beams of heavy nuclei     from Ne through Fe accelerated by the Lawrence Berkeley     Laboratory Bevalac.  The calibration data have been used to     verify proper function of the telescope, to characterize the     detector response, and to develop algorithms for selection of     the data and for determination of mass and charge of incident     particles by use of the multiple dE/dx vs.  residual E plus     trajectory information returned by the telescope.       Electron response was investigated over the energy range 3-35     MeV making use of a linear electron accelerator at the     University of Chicago Argonne Cancer Hospital.  Electron energy     ranges were found to be very broad and poorly defined since no     effort has been made to optimize the telescope for electron     response.  Some uncertainty remains in the calibration results     also because of the difficulty of using the accelerator at the     very low intensities required for our tests.  Further     experimental work on the electron calibration using the flight     spare HET is planned.       Response to the RTG radiations was tested using a simulated RTG     (sRTG) at JPL in 1982 and, immediately before launch, by     exposure to the flight RTG during the RTG mating test at the     Kennedy Space Center (KSC).  Initial tests with the sRTG showed     RTG-induced events in prime HET data channels at intensity     levels comparable to those expected from galactic cosmic rays.     After adjustments of discriminator thresholds and modifications     to the telescope logic the level of interference was shown to     be markedly reduced by a second exposure to the sRTG.  To     further reduce background from the RTG's, a 1.6 kg tungsten     shield was placed between the SIM-1 and SIM-2 units.  The     configuration and placement of the shield was determined by use     of Monte-Carlo techniques to provide the maximum shielding     effect for the allotted tungsten mass given the known locations     and shapes of the RTG radiation source and the detectors to be     shielded.  Since detectors D[4] - D[6] are key detectors for     the HET pulse height analysis priority system and logic and for     the electron counting rates (H[6] - H[8]), they were chosen as     the detectors in which the maximum possible reduction in the     rate of RTG-induced events should be achieved.  Tests at KSC     and in- flight experience show that the strategy was effective,     and that RTG-induced events no longer make significant     contributions to HET data channels except for the H[1] and H[6]     counting rates, which, during quiet times, respond primarily to     RTG-induced events.       In flight, an in-flight calibrator (IFC) is commanded on once     per month.  The IFC provides an exhaustive check of the gains     and non-linearities of each amplifier by presenting at the     inputs to the charge sensitive amplifiers a series of 2048     pulses, timed to the readout cycle, which cover the entire     dynamic ranges of both the high and low gain amplifiers used in     the pulse-height analysis.  A normal IFC run consists of two     passes through the pulse sequence, and requires approximately     six hours at the nominal cruise telemetry bit rate.  In     addition, house-keeping channels monitor the regulated voltage     lines that supply the amplifiers and the detector biases, the     temperatures of the detectors and electronics, and the zero-     offset of the digital to analogue converter (DAC) of the IFC.

urn:esa:psa:context:instrument:uly.cospin-hft,COSPIN-HIGH FLUX TELESCOPE for ULY,COSPIN-HIGH FLUX TELESCOPE,"       (descriptions excerpted from [SIMPSONETAL1992A])     Instrument Overview   ===================     The HFT is designed: (a) to provide measurements of protons,     helium, and heavier particles when the fluxes are too intense     for the larger telescopes, and (b) to provide an instrument     with exceptional azimuthal resolution so that highly collimated     field-aligned particle distributions can be measured if they     are encountered, especially over the solar poles and in     Jupiter's magnetosphere.       Detectors   =========     The HFT, which is mounted on top of the HET, consists of a     single 25 mm^2 x 18 [micro]m silicon surface-barrier detector,     passively collimated by a fan-shaped aluminium collimator to     give a viewing aperture of 17 [deg.] x 60 [deg.], with a     geometrical factor of 0.033 cm^2-sr.  The collimator imposes a     low-energy cut-off of 50 MeV for protons and 5 MeV for     electrons incident from outside the viewing aperture.  The     exposed surface of the detector carries an evaporated layer of     aluminium 0.25 mg/cm^2 thick to exclude light and attenuate     low-energy protons, which would cause serious pulse pile-up     when the flux is large and the energy spectrum steep, as in the     inner Jovian magnetosphere.  The absorber excludes protons     below 80 KeV and electrons below 10 KeV.  There is a small     sensitivity to directly incident sun light which slightly     increases the detector leakage current when the instrument is     viewing the Sun.  The thinness of the detector, the high     discriminator levels, and the fast shaping time constants used     in the electronics make the HFT very insensitive to electrons.     The detector output is amplified and shaped using     double-differentiation time constants of 100 ns to provide     bipolar pulses that can be handled without excessive loss or     base-line shift at rates up to 10^6 per second.       Five discriminator channels (designated F[1] - F[5]) set at     levels corresponding to energy depositions between 0.20 and     36.0 MeV define the energy ranges given in Table 9.  The F[1]     discriminator can be set by command to any one of 16 threshold     levels between 0.20 and 4.3 MeV.  Alternatively, F[1] can be     commanded into a stepping mode where the discriminator cycles     continuously through the 16 levels at a rate of one step per     data accumulation period (16 seconds at a telemetry data rate     of 1024 bits/s).  The stepped mode has been selected for normal     mission operations.  The F[2] discriminator can be set by     command to two levels corresponding to 0.21 and 0.50 MeV,     respectively.  Channels F[3], F[4], and F[5] are set at levels     2.45, 8.36, and 36.0 MeV, respectively.  F[1] levels 0-2 and     F[2] levels 0-1 respond primarily to protons.  F[1] levels 3-13     and F[3] respond primarily to helium.  F[4] responds primarily     to the CNO group.  F[5] responds primarily to S and the Fe     group.  The F[2] output to the DPU can be scaled down by a     factor four on command when it is expected that the rate may     exceed the capability of the DPU interface unit, as during     Jupiter encounter.       The instrument includes an internal, dual range, 128-step pulse     generator for in-flight calibration of the discriminator     triggering levels.       The instrument is mounted so that the collimator 'fan' plane     lies parallel to the spacecraft spin axis.  The central axis of     the detector and the collimator is set at an angle of 45 [deg.]     with respect to the Earth-pointing end of the spin axis so that     the aperture extends from a spacecraft polar angle of 15 [deg.]     to 75 [deg.].  All HFT counting rate accumulation intervals are     spin synchronized using the Ulysses spacecraft sun reference     pulse.  Channels F[1] - F[5] are each accumulated for an     integral number of spins every telemetry read out.  The output     of channel F[2] is also sector accumulated using 32 sectors per     spacecraft rotation (11.25 [deg.] per sector), which permits     the recognition of highly collimated angular distributions with     a resolution of ~= 20 [deg.].  To conserve storage and     telemetry facilities, eight equispaced sectors are successively     accumulated for an integral number of spacecraft rotations     having a nominal average period of 32 spacecraft minor frames.     During the period over the solar poles and during an adjacent     18-month period, the angle between the assumed direction of the     interplanetary magnetic field and the spin axis will lie in the     range 40 [deg.] +/- 25 [deg.], so that the field direction will     be included within the HFT aperture at some time during each     spacecraft spin period.       Operational Considerations   ==========================     At closest approach to Jupiter (~= 6 R[j]), from Pioneer 10/11     and Voyager 1/2 reports we estimate the electron intensity > 10     KeV to be ~= 10^8 cm^-2 s^-1 sr^-1, or 3 x 10^6 s^-1 within the     acceptance angle of the telescope.  This is on average ~= 0.3     particles per 100 ns, with an average deposit of 15 - 20 KeV     per particle (the maximum energy deposit is ~= 60 KeV).  The     high order of pile-up required to trigger the 200 KeV     discriminator makes electron contamination of this channel     unlikely.  Electron pile-up studies have been performed at NRC     using a small electron accelerator facility.       At L ~= 7 R[j] where the proton flux reaches a maximum, we     estimate that for energies greater than a specified energy, E,     and a dJ/dE [proportional to] E^-3 spectrum, the integral     proton flux through the detector will be ~= 2 x 10^5 E^-2 cm^-2     s^-1 sr^-1 at energies around 1 MeV.  If this energy dependence     persists down to low energy (50 - 100 KeV), the proton pile-up     would, in the absence of an absorber in front of the detector,     saturate the 0.20 MeV discriminator, and this effect would be     appreciable out to L = 10 - 12 (where L is the McIlwain     parameter which is equivalent to R[j] at the equator).  The     presence of the 0.25 mg/cm^2 Al absorber significantly extends     the intensity range where proton pile-up is unimportant.       Since the alpha particle discriminator F[3] is set at 2.2 times     the maximum energy deposition by protons, it requires a three-     fold proton pile-up to simulate an alpha.  At L = 7, the proton     contamination of the F[3] alpha channel is estimated at less     than 10% and for L > 9 it is negligible.  In interplanetary     space, the highest counting rates expected at the lowest     discriminator levels are in the 10^3 - 10^4 s^-1 range, well     below the level where pile-up or loss is significant.       In-flight Performance   =====================     The post-launch performance of the HFT has been nominal in all     respects.  Except for calibration periods, the HFT has been     operated with the F[1] discriminator in stepped mode and the     F[2] discriminator set low.  Periodic spikes in the HFT     detector current monitor channel were observed following     instrument switch-on with a period of 4064 +/- 16 seconds.     This effect is caused by sunlight incident on the detector.     The period is a function of the HFT view cone, the spacecraft     spin period and the 32 second sampling of the detector current.     Some sensitivity to sunlight had been expected from bench tests     prior to instrument delivery and it was a relief to find that     the maximum observed amplitude (~ 80 nA) was well below the     level which would cause any increase in system noise.       It is possible to extend the proton and helium energy spectra     derived from the other COSPIN sensors down to about 0.3     MeV/nucleon using the F[1] stepped discriminator channel.     Using an assumed spectral form for the proton and helium     differential energy spectra, the free parameters are determined     by a best fit to the 16 F[1] counting rates.  This analysis has     been performed for the period ~ 1700 to 2400 UT on day 296 just     after instrument switch-on and yields reasonably consistent     flux values with the LET, HET, and KET.

urn:esa:psa:context:instrument:uly.cospin-ket,COSPIN-KIEL ELECTRON TELESCOPE for ULY,COSPIN-KIEL ELECTRON TELESCOPE,"       (descriptions excerpted from [SIMPSONETAL1992A])     Instrument Overview   ===================     The KET consists of two separate boxes, SIM3A and SIM3B,     mounted on the other side of the spacecraft platform with     respect to the SIM1 and SIM2 units.  SIM3B is the telescope     portion of the KET, and SIM3A contains the analogue and digital     electronics for the KET.       The KET is designed to measure electron fluxes between 2.5 and     6000 MeV, and to determine energy spectra in the range 7 - 170     MeV.  The telescope also provides measurements of the proton     and alpha-particle fluxes in several energy windows between 3     and > 2100 MeV/nucleon.  In addition, two low-energy electron     and proton channels provide anisotropy information in 8     sectors.       The determination of electron spectra and their variation with     distance from the sun and solar latitude provides vital     information on the solar modulation of interstellar electrons     as well as on acceleration and propagation of interplanetary     and solar electrons.  The measurement of protons and helium     nuclei with the same telescope enhances confidence in the     calibration and response of the telescope, and permits     investigation of the dependence on particle species of the     effects of solar distance and latitude.       Detectors   =========     To reduce mass and complexity of the instrument, the KET     consists of two separate parts: the sensor (SIM3B) and the     electronics box (SIM3A), both mounted beneath the spacecraft     platform.  The telescope is mounted to view perpendicular to     the spin axis and has an acceptance angle of 44.6 degrees full     cone with an auxiliary field of view of 106 degrees.     Accordingly, for nuclei the geometric factor varies between     0.72 cm^2 sr for particles reaching D[2] and 6.5 cm^2 sr for     particles stopping in D[1].  A more sophisticated evaluation of     the geometric factor taking into account energy dependence and     effects of scattering and shower production for electrons is     shown in Table 10.  The instrument incorporates several     techniques in order to identify the particles and their     energies: electron- photon cascades, Cherenkov thresholds,     dE/dx versus E method, and discriminator settings.     Functionally, the detector system divides naturally into two     parts, consisting of an entrance telescope and a calorimeter     surrounded by a guard counter.       The entrance telescope is composed of a silica aerogel     Cherenkov detector C[1] inserted between two surface-barrier     semiconductor detectors D[1] and D[2].  Together with the guard     counter A, it defines the geometry and selects singly-charged     particles of high velocity ([beta] > 0.938) to discriminate     between electrons and protons.  In conventional designs the     velocity discrimination is performed using a high-pressure-gas     Cherenkov detector.  The availability of a low- density solid     material like silica aerogel, which can have a refractive index     as low as 1.02 to 1.2, which is translucent and which shows a     negligible scintillation contribution to the signal, allows us     to circumvent the disadvantages of a gas Cherenkov detector,     which include a significant weight penalty and additional     material in the acceptance cone.  For use in the KET, we have     chosen an aerogel with a refractive index of n = 1.066.  Since     no use is made of the directionality of the Cherenkov light,     the block of aerogel is placed in a diffusion box with     millipore walls.  The light signal of C[1] is viewed by the     phototube PM1 through a hole in the guard counter, A.  To     prevent particles from hitting the photocathode of PM1     directly, and thus simulating an aerogel detector response, a     scintillator disc S[1] has been introduced in front of PM1 as a     veto counter.  S[1] gives a signal for minimum ionizing     particles 6 sigma above the signature of relativistic alpha     particles in aerogel.       The calorimeter consists of a lead-fluoride crystal C[1] in     which the electron shower develops, and a scintillator cup S[2]     to detect particles not absorbed in C[2].  C[2] has a thickness     of 2.2 cm, corresponding to 2.5 radiation lengths.       Lead-fluoride was chosen for its short radiation length (X[0] =     6.6 g/cm^2), its high density ([rho] = 7.7 g/cm^3), and its     convenient refractive index (n = 1.885).  Furthermore, it does     not scintillate and is thus relatively insensitive to the RTG     background.  The Cherenkov light of C[2] is viewed through a     hole in S[2] using a diffusion-box design.  To prevent     particles from escaping undetected through the hole in S[2],     the planar part of the cup has been extended.       The scintillator A not only helps to define the sensor     geometry, but also protects from background caused by nuclear     interactions produced in the telescope by cosmic rays and by     neutrons from the RTG.  If experience in flight shows that     shower development in the calorimeter reduces the effective     geometry factor to an unacceptably low value, the discriminator     threshold of A can be raised by telecommand for penetrating     electrons only (channel E[300]).       To compensate for a possible phototube gain loss during the     long mission lifetime, the high voltages can be stepped up by     telecommand in eight steps.  In the case of complete failure of     a detector, it can logically be switched off by telecommand     using the onboard failure reconfiguration logic.  Stimulation     of the onboard electronics for checkout purposes is also     provided.       The data produced by KET consist of pulse height analysis data     and coincidence counting rates corresponding to broad energy     ranges for incident particles.  The ranges and time resolutions     for the counting rates are shown in Table 10.  Pulse height     analysis is performed on a sample of the incident particle     events to provide good energy resolution (between 60 and 100 %     for electrons) and clear identification of particle species.     Single-detector counting rates and housekeeping data are also     telemetered to monitor instrument performance.       Calibration   ===========     The KET instrument measures cosmic ray electrons with energies     from a few MeV to several GeV, which have a flux in the     ecliptic plane 3 to 4 orders of magnitude lower than the proton     flux.  The instrument response was therefore extensively     calibrated with both electrons and protons.  The most important     goals of these calibrations were:           - to determine the response of the individual detectors as a           function of particle species and energy         - to determine the detection thresholds for the individual           detectors, especially the Cherenkov thresholds of C[1] and           C[2]         - to determine the energy thresholds for the coincidence           counting rate channels         - to provide correction tables for the counting rate data           (response matrix)         - to determine the electron detection efficiency of           individual counting rate channels and of the complete           instrument as a function of energy         - to determine the proton rejection rate for electron           channels         - to use the calibration data to verify and adjust the           mathematical model of the instrument         - to determine the background in the various counting rate           channels due to the RTG         Results of proton calibrations     ------------------------------       The main goals of the proton calibrations were to determine       proper settings for i) the Cherenkov thresholds of C[1] and       C[2], and ii) the discriminator threshold values C[10],       C[20], and S[20], this last one being actually determined by       the range of the particles in the telescope.  In addition,       these calibrations provided measurements of key parameters       such as angular response and sensitivity of the       anticoincidence which define the effective geometry factor of       the instrument.         Results of electron calibrations     --------------------------------       These calibrations resulted in the measurements of: i) the       response of the calorimeter C[2] as a function of energy, the       monoenergetic response of C[2] being of fundamental       importance to determine the electron spectrum from the flight       data, and ii) the variation of the efficiency and response of       the telescope as a function of energy and incidence angle.         It was possible to determine relative variations of the       response of the detector with energy and incidence angle of       the beam.  However, it proved to be extremely difficult to       measure the absolute efficiency for electrons, particularly       at low energies, where the use of external counters to       monitor the beam is impossible because of the large       scattering they induce.  Therefore, only the relative       efficiency could be reliably measured.         Results of the RTG calibration tests     ------------------------------------       The RTG calibration of the KET was performed in 1985 at Mound       Laboratories using the Galileo Flight RTG (F[3]) and in 1986       and 1990 at KSC during the RTG compatibility tests as part of       the two launch campaigns.  The main results can be summarized       as follows:         - RTG induced background in the instrument leads to a         deadtime increase from 0.003 % to 0.5 %, which is a         tolerable value. The main contribution to the dead time         stems from the scintillation guard counter with its large         field of view.       - From a scientific point of view, only the channels P[1] and         E[4] are adversely affected, as the RTG background is of         the order of the cosmic ray quiet flux in these KET         particle channels, e.g. 1 x 10^-3 counts/s in E[4]. They         will only produce meaningful data during solar flares and         near Jupiter. Use of Cherenkov detectors and multifold         coincidences guarantees the low susceptibility of all the         other KET scientific channels.       - Between the RTG tests in 1986 and 1990 the KET observed an         increase of the RTG background by about a factor of 2. This         is attributed to time variations in the plutonium decay         chain.       - Flight data measured during quiet times confirm the same         background level in the RTG-sensitive channels P[1] and         E[4] as observed during the 1990 RTG-test on ground.         Simulation of the telescope     ---------------------------       In order to determine the absolute efficiency of KET for       electrons, it was necessary to use a Monte-Carlo simulation       of the instrument.  The GEANT program, developed and widely       used by particle physicists, was adapted for this purpose.         In a first step, the different parameters of the telescope,       namely thresholds and detector resolutions, were adjusted in       order to reproduce the calibration data obtained at the       different accelerators, with a parallel beam in the axis of       the instrument.  An excellent agreement between the       simulation and calibration results was achieved.  This       agreement ensures that we can reliably determine the       efficient geometry factor of KET for an isotropic flux, which       was done according to the method given by Sullivan (Sullivan       J.D., Nucl. Inst.  and Meth.  95, 5, 1971).         In-flight calibration     ---------------------       On COSPIN switch-on the currents and high voltage values were       checked and found to be nominal.  The in-flight test       generator was used to check the amplifier gains and the       functioning of the coincidence logic and of the failure mode       reconfiguration.  All of these were found to be nominal.         To measure the performance of the detectors, the linearity of       the analogue chains, and the discriminator thresholds, it is       necessary to use the cosmic ray data themselves.  Protons and       helium nuclei with an energy above 2.1 GeV/n can be used for       this purpose since they are minimum ionizing particles that       penetrate the telescope while producing almost no nuclear       interactions in the detectors, and are above the Cherenkov       threshold C[10].  Their large flux allows collection in a few       days of a sample with sufficient statistical accuracy to       monitor all the detector responses and amplifier gains except       for C[1] (for which no PHA value is registered).  For P[4000]       the in-flight responses are identical within a few percent to       the responses derived from calibrations with a beam of 5       GeV/c protons.  The position and width of the helium response       for these detectors are also compatible with the expected       values derived from the proton response.         The C[1] PHA are registered only in the E[4] and E[12]       channels, and therefore can be monitored only in these       channels.  The C[1] response for E[12] particles is       compatible with the calibration results for electrons of 7.5       and 10 MeV.       Measured Parameters   ===================     Table 10.

urn:esa:psa:context:instrument:uly.cospin-let,COSPIN-LOW ENERGY TELESCOPE for ULY,COSPIN-LOW ENERGY TELESCOPE,"       (descriptions excerpted from [SIMPSONETAL1992A])     Instrument Overview   ===================     The COSPIN Low Energy Telescope (LET) measures the flux, energy     spectra and elemental composition of solar energetic particles     and low energy cosmic ray nuclei from hydrogen up to iron.  The     instrument covers an energy range from ~ 1 to ~ 75 MeV/n, using     a double dE/dX vs.  E telescope.  Comprehensive on-board     particle identifier electronics and an event priority system     enable rare nuclei to be analyzed in preference to the more     common species.  Isotope separation for light nuclei such as He     is also achieved.       The LET sensor and associated analogue and digital electronics     are mounted in the central portion of the SIM-1 package,     between the Anisotropy Telescopes and the Digital Processing     Unit.  The instrument aperture is protected by a hinged cover     that was opened by telecommand after launch.  A gas purge     system was also included to provide additional protection     against detector contamination during ground testing and the     ascent phase of the launch.       Detectors   =========     The LET sensor consists of a four-element solid-state detector     telescope surrounded by a cylindrical plastic scintillator     anticoincidence shield, together with associated analogue     electronics.  Detectors D[1] and D[2] are large-area (6 cm^2)     surface barrier devices having nominal thicknesses of 30     microns (D[1]) and 100 microns (D[2]), while D[3] and D[4] are     2000 micron-thick Li-drifted devices of 10.0 and 12.5 cm^2     active area, respectively.  D[4] forms part of the     anticoincidence shield.  The aperture of the telescope is     covered by two thin foils, an inner Ti foil (2 microns) and an     outer Kapton foil (8 microns), included for electrical     screening and thermal control purposes, respectively.  The     telescope geometrical factor, defined by two circular     collimators mounted in front of D[1] and D[2] in order to     reduce unwanted edge effects, has a value of 0.58 cm^2 sr for     the coincidence channels.  Low resolution single-detector only)     measurements of protons and alpha particles are also made.  In     this case, the geometrical factor is ~ 9.1 cm^2sr.       The signals from detectors D[1], D[2] and D[3] are fed into     individual amplifier chains consisting of a charge-sensitive     preamplifier followed by a parallel combination of three pulse-     shaping voltage amplifiers (PSA).  To accommodate the large     dynamic range required, separate low- and high-gain PSA have     been used, selected via an analogue switch controlled by the     third (fast) PSA in conjunction with a discriminator.  The     selected outputs are fed into a common 10 bit (1024 channel)     ADC that provides pulse height information.  The fast PSA are     followed by a number of threshold discriminators, the outputs     of which are used in the coincidence logic to define a series     of counting rate channels.       In addition, the outputs of the slower PSA are fed into a     Particle Identifier (PI) circuit that provides both counting     rate and event priority information.  The LET PI circuit makes     it possible to obtain the counting rates corresponding to     groups of nuclear species, and comprises a set of analogue     function generators and discriminators that divide the     instrument response into regions of different nuclear charge.     The actual analogue functions used are of two types, namely             E[1]+ b[i]E[2] = a[i]                 (1)         and             E[2](b[i] + E[i]) = a[i]              (2)       where E[1], E[2] and E[3] are the energies deposited in     detectors D[1], D[2] and D[3], respectively, and a[i], b[i] are     constants.  For particles stopping in D[2], the loci of points     satisfying equation (1) for given pairs of (a[i],b[i]) values     define boundaries on the [DELTA]E ([is defined as]E[1]) vs.     residual E ( E[2]) diagram that separate the tracks     corresponding to different elements or groups of elements into     so-called 'charge groups'.  The charge groups defined for the     D[1] - D[2] range are: protons; (He^-3, He^-4); (Li, Be, B);     (C, N, O); Z >= 10 nuclei.  In a similar way, charge group     boundaries for particles stopping in D[3] are defined by     equation (2) with suitable pairs of (a[i], b[i]) values.  A     different functional form is required in this case because of     the pronounced curvature of the [DELTA]E vs.  residual E tracks     resulting from the large thickness of D[3] relative to D[2].     The same charge groups as before are defined for the D[1] -     D[2] - D[3] range, with the addition of a high-Z group     corresponding to Z >= 20.       Each of the charge groups has an associated counting rate     register which is incremented each time a valid event within     the group is observed.  In the spacecraft prime (real time     telemetry) mode, accumulation intervals are 32 s for the proton     and alpha particle rate channels and 128 s for the heavy ion     rate channels.  In addition to providing counting rate     information, the PI output is used to generate a 4-bit event     code that controls the Event Priority System.  The latter is     included in order to maximize the LET PHA data-collection     efficiency for the rarer nuclear species in the cosmic ray     flux.  Such a system is needed because the LET telemetry     allocation (52 bits per s at the highest bitrate) limits the     number of PHA events that can be transmitted to a maximum of 1     per second.  Each pulse-height analyzed event is assigned a 4-     bit priority value on the basis of its event code via     predefined sequences stored in a ROM.  Only the pulse heights     corresponding to the highest-priority event occurring within     every 1 s sampling period are transferred to the telemetry     stream.  The sequence of priority assignments for all event     codes is changed periodically in order to prevent biasing     effects.  In addition to pulse height data and proton, alpha     and heavy ion rates, the LET data frame contains digital status     information and analogue housekeeping values, as well as     counting rate data for the individual detectors.  Housekeeping     information includes instrument voltages, the detector leakage     currents and temperature values for the detector telescope and     electronics.  A summary of the LET digital data channels is     given in Table 4.       Also included in the instrument is an In-Flight Calibrator     (IFC) circuit that checks, on command, the electrical     characteristics of the instrument by delivering a sequence of     pulses having well-defined amplitudes to all amplifier inputs.       In-flight Performance   =====================     The LET aperture cover was opened by means of the pyrotechnic     actuators on October 19.  On COSPIN turn-on four days later,     all housekeeping data indicated that the instrument status was     nominal, and the scientific data showed that a moderate solar     flare event was in progress at the time of switch-on.       Another example of LET data acquired in flight soon after turn-     on . . .  covers a 4-day period starting at 00:00 hrs UT on 7     November 1990, at which time a series of impulsive solar flare     events occurred on the Sun.  Such events are known to produce     an enrichment in the isotope ^(3)He relative to the usually     more abundant 4He.  Both isotopes were present throughout the     period and were well resolved by the LET.       In addition to the initial flight data from the Ulysses     instrument presented above, essentially identical LET sensors     that were flown on the Phobos 1 and 2 space probes have     provided a wealth of data on the solar and interplanetary     energetic particle populations during the rising phase of solar     cycle 22 [Marsden et al., Nucl. Instr.  and Meth.  290, 211,     1990; Marsden et al., Planet.  Space Sci., 39, 57, 1991].     Finally, a substantial database on the performance of the LET     has been accumulated during ground testing; the instrument has     been extensively calibrated at particle accelerator facilities,     with exposures to both heavy ion and proton beams [Kamermans et     al., Nucl. Instr.  and Meth.  171, 87, 1980; LeBorgne et al.,     Report ESA STM-224, 1981; Marsden et al., Nucl. Instr.  and     Meth.  221, 619, 1984].       The in-flight performance of the COSPIN LET instrument has     matched that expected from ground calibration and test.  While     the majority of single detector counting rates are dominated by     counts produced by the RTG neutron and gamma ray background,     all coincidence channels show good immunity to RTG induced     backgrounds.  An exception is the low energy 0.3 - 1.5 MeV     electron channel, which is dominated by the RTG contribution     except during large solar particle events and, we expect, in     Jupiter's magnetosphere.  The performance in flight so far     demonstrates that the experiment is capable of making important     contributions to our knowledge of the particle populations in     the heliosphere during the exploratory out-of-ecliptic Ulysses     mission.

urn:esa:psa:context:instrument:uly.epac,ENERGETIC PARTICLE COMPOSITION INSTRUMENT for ULY,ENERGETIC PARTICLE COMPOSITION INSTRUMENT,"     Instrument Overview   ===================     (excerpted from [KEPPLERETAL1992A])       The EPAC sensor will measure the fluxes, angular distributions,     energy spectra, and composition of ions in the energy range     from 300 keV/nucleon to 25 MeV/nucleon.       The instrument generates 12 different classes of data.  All     events are categorised by their (dE/dx)-signal into three crude     classes; their respective numbers are transmitted from three     event memories.  So besides the 32 event strings we also get     per EDF the total number of events recorded during that time     interval.  Less detailed information on energy spectra are     obtained with higher time resolution from 4 groups of ions.  8     energy channels are formed for each group.  Bands,     corresponding to the (dE/dx-E) tracks are stored in a RAM     look-up table.  All events are sorted accordingly for 4 ion     groups (He, C-N-O, S-group, F-group).  For telescopes 2 and 3     these are in addition resolved into 8 spin-sectors.  A full set     will be transmitted in about 34 min.  If only one species is     selected, time resolution increases to ~ 8.5 min.       Protons are identified separately in 8 channels (3-bit PHA)     using the B-detector outputs (500 keV to 1.6 MeV).  All     channels are resolved into eight sectors.       From the A-detector's output, integral fluxes of ions are     obtained.  Contributions will come from ions above an energy,     defined by dead-layer thickness and electronic threshold of     about 145 keV.  Contribution from electrons scattered through     large angles may contribute to the lowest channel, but as the     detector thickness corresponds to the range of ~ 25 keV     electrons, its electron detection efficiency is certainly << 1.       The 4 A-detector outputs are connected to the PHA through a     multiplexer (as are the B-detectors).  The thresholds of the     PHA are adjusted such, that in 'High Gain'-Mode channel 1 to 3     'protons' (Z >= 1), in channel 4 to 5 '[alpha]-particles' (i.e.     Z >= 2), in channel 6-8 'oxygen' (i.e.  Z >= 6) is detected.     In 'Low-Gain', the passbands are shifted one channel up:     channel 1 and 2 record now Z >= 1, channels 3 to 4 Z >= 2,     channels 5 to 7 Z >= 6 and channel 8 Z >= 10 particles.  The     latter corresponds to about 500 keV/nucleon.  This class of     data is obtained in 16 min.       Much higher time resolution is obtained from rates, which     correspond to the integral over energy of the proton and the Z     >= 1 spectra.  Telescopes 2 and 3 are resolved in eight     sectors.       The solar aspect angle varies in the course of the mission from     ~ 90 [degrees] after launch to less than 11.5 [degrees] at     Jupiter.  It will again increase during polar passage.  This     means, that there will be periods, when telescopes 1 or 2 will     be fully illuminated by the sun and might affect the Z >= 1     data, but not coincidence rates.       Two electron channels corresponding to 100 keV <= E <= 0.4 MeV     and to E >= 0.3 MeV are also formed for each telescope.  These     channels are defined from proper combination of dicriminator     thresholds.  Their energy range is, however, not very     accurately defined (due to electron scattering).  For heavy     ions there are also 16 rate channels for each of the 4     telescopes and each of the 4 species.  They are read out once     every 8 minutes.       For each telescope the background rates of detector B and C are     transmitted, each accumulated over 4 minutes.  The equivalent     geometrical factor is F[B] = 1.60 cm^2 and F[C] = 6.02 cm^2.     For coincidence rates of all 3 detectors the geometrical factor     G = 0.08 cm^2 ster applies.

urn:esa:psa:context:instrument:uly.gas,GAS INSTRUMENT for ULY,GAS INSTRUMENT,"     Instrument Overview   ===================     (excerpted from [WITTEETAL1992])       Abstract.  -- The properties (density, bulk velocity relative     to the solar system, and temperature) of the local interstellar     gas, represented by neutral helium penetrating the heliosphere,     will be measured in-situ for the first time by the ULYSSES GAS     instrument.  By employing the solar gravitational field as a     natural velocity analyser, the bulk velocity relative to the     solar system and the temperature of the E as can be derived     from the angular distributions of the particles measured in at     least two widely separated points in the heliosphere.  The gas     density can be determined if a composition corresponding to     cosmic abundances is assumed.  The neutral particles are     detected via the secondary electrons or ions which are emitted     upon particle impact from a freshly deposited lithium-fluoride     (LiF) layer.  The physical principles and assumptions on which     the experiment is based, the main technical features of the     instrument, and first measurements in space are briefly     described.

urn:esa:psa:context:instrument:uly.grb,SOLAR X-RAY/COSMIC GAMMA-RAY BURST INSTRUMENT for ULY,SOLAR X-RAY/COSMIC GAMMA-RAY BURST INSTRUMENT,"       Instrument Overview   ===================     (excerpted from [HURLEYETAL1992])       The GRB experiment was proposed in 1977 with a twin experiment     aboard the NASA spacecraft.  This approach had numerous     advantages: a carefully intercalibrated pair of experiments at     opposite ecliptic latitudes would survey the solar equatorial     regions extensively, and stereoscopic observations would be     relatively easy to compare with matched detectors.     Triangulation baselines for cosmic gamma-ray bursts would be     long, and the fact that two detectors in the network would be     out of the ecliptic plane would provide a particularly     favorable geometry for localization (non-coplanar detectors are     required for arrival time analysis).       With the unique mission opportunities, however, came unique     design constraints.  A radiation-hardened microprocessor was     required to survive the passage through the Jovian radiation     belts; few were available during the design phase of the GRB     experiment.  The limited performance of the unit chosen     dictated simplified operating modes for the experiment.     Electrical power aboard Ulysses is provided by a radioisotope     thermoelectric generator (RTG) containing 10 kg of 238Pu (about     10^5 Ci).  The GRB instrument would be the first cosmic     gamma-ray burst detector to have to operate in this unfavorable     background environment.  To minimize the interference from the     RTG, the sensors had to be mounted on the magnetometer boom,     and were required to be essentially amagnetic.  (More     precisely, the remnant field could not exceed 2 x 10^-5 G at 25     cm.) Finally, the mass and power allocations for the GRB     experiment were small compared to inner planet missions-2 kg     and 2.6 W, respectively.         Scientific Objectives     ---------------------       The Ulysses solar X-ray/cosmic gamma-ray burst instrument       (acronym: GRB) has three main scientific objectives.  The       first is the study and monitoring of solar flare X-ray       emission.  The second is the detection and localization of       cosmic gamma-ray bursts.  The third is the in-situ detection       of Jovian auroral X-radiation. . . .  For a review of       experimental data on solar flare X-rays, see [DENNIS1985],       [DENNIS1988].  Reviews of cosmic gamma-ray burst observations       have appeared in [HURLEY1988], [HURLEY1989].         Jovian X-radiation was first detected by [METZGERETAL1983]       using the Einstein satellite.  X-rays in the 0.2-3 keV band       were imaged with 4'' resolution, and provided evidence that       the sources of X-radiation were the Jovian north and south       auroral zones.  The origin of the X-rays could have been       either electron bremsstrahlung in the Jovian upper       atmosphere, or characteristic line emission from atmospheric       atoms excited by heavy ions precipitating from the Io torus.       These two models make very different predictions about the       hard X-ray flux in the Ulysses GRB energy range.

urn:esa:psa:context:instrument:uly.gwe,GRAVITATIONAL WAVE EXPERIMENT for ULY,GRAVITATIONAL WAVE EXPERIMENT,"       Instrument Overview   ===================     (excepted from: [BERTOTTIETAL1992A])       Abstract.  -- Since the optimum size of a gravitational wave     detector is the wave length, interplanetary dimensions are     needed for the mHz band of interest.  Doppler tracking of     Ulysses will provide the most sensitive attempt to date at the     detection of gravitational waves in the low frequency band.     The driving noise source is the fluctuations in the refractive     index of interplanetary plasma.  This dictates the timing of     the experiment to be near solar opposition and sets the target     accuracy for the fractional frequency change at 3.0 x 10^-14     for integration times of the order of 1000 sec.  The     instrumentation utilized by the experiment is distributed     between the radio systems on the spacecraft and the seven     participating ground stations of the Deep Space Network and     Medicina.  Preliminary analysis is available of the     measurements taken during the Ulysses first opposition test.

The ions (Ei     >50 keV) and electrons (Ee >30 keV) are identified uniquely and     detected by five separate solid-state detector telescopes that     are oriented to give nearly complete pitch-angle coverage     (i.e., coverage of essentially 4 [pi] ster) from the spinning     spacecraft.  Ion elemental abundances are determined by a delta     E vs E telescope using a thin (5 [micrometer]) front solid     state detector element in a three-element telescope.     Experiment operation is controlled by a microprocessor-based     data system.  Inflight calibration is provided by radioactive     sources mounted on telescope covers which can be closed for     calibration purposes and for radiation protection during the     course of the mission.  Ion and electron spectral information     is determined using both broad-energy-range rate channels and a     32 channel pulse-height analyser (channels spaced     logarithmically) for more detailed spectra.  The instrument     weighs 5.775 kg and uses 4.0 W of power.  Some initial     in-ecliptic measurements are presented which demonstrate the     features of the instrument.

urn:esa:psa:context:instrument:uly.hiscale-ca,HISCALE Composition Aperature for Ulysses,HISCALE Composition Aperature,"       Instrument Overview   ===================     (adapted from: Lanzerotti, et al. 1992)    The Composition Aperture system (CA; sometimes referred to   in the Ulysses project as the ""WART"") uses a multiparameter   detection technique to provide measurements of ion composition   in an energy range similar to those of HISCALE LEMS/LEFS. The   foil thickness, detector thicknesses, and electronic thresholds   were selected to enable the separation of low energy electron  and ion fluxes at high sensitivity by comparing detector  responses.    The Composition Aperature telescope is referred to as CA 60, where  the number indicates the inclination of the telescope axis  with respect to the spacecraft spin axis.  The BC detector pairs consist  of two equal 200 micrometer thick, totally depleted silicon surface  barrier detectors. The D detector is a thin (5 micrometer) silicon  detector of the epitaxial type.   The CA telescope uses detectors D and C as  an ([Delta]E vs E) telescope, with the B detector operating  in anticoincidence. The geometrical factor for the DCB  combination is 0.24 cm^2sr. The logic and discrete energy  channels for the CA telescope are shown in Table 3.  Information from the discrete ion composition channels  listed in Table 3 is used in a priority scheme to identify  those individual particle events whose energy loss signals  in detectors D and Care to be pulse-height-analysed (see  below) and included in the telemetry data stream.  A rotating four-level priority scheme, shown in Table  4, is used to balance the CA system response to light and  heavy ion species.   The priority scheme uses the species group analyzed  in the immediate previous event in a given sector to  establish the relative priorities among the four species  groups for the current sector. Thus, if there were an irongroup  event analyzed in the immediate previous spin, the  fourth column of Table 4 would be operative and shows  that the priority order for analysis, from the highest to the  lowest priority, would be an event in the oxygen group,  the iron group, helium, and protons. Thus, the priority  scheme insures that a large number of relatively ""rare""  ion species will be presented for analysis.  In addition to the discrete telescope logic channels  that are listed Tables 1-3, the singles counting rates in  the individual detectors are monitored and telemetered  in a multiplexed mode (Tab. 2). These rates are used  as engineering monitors of the instrument performance.  These rates can also be used, if required, to make pulsepileup  corrections to the coincidence rates.    TABLE 3.

The foil thickness, detector   thicknesses, and electronic thresholds were selected to   enable the separation of low energy electron and ion   fluxes at high sensitivity by comparing detector responses.    The individual LEFS telescopes are referred to as LEFS 60,   and LEFS 150, where the number indicates the inclination of   the telescope axis with respect to the spacecraft spin axis.  The MF, M' F', and BC detector pairs (Tab. 1) are  identical (for ease of replacement pre-flight); each consists  of two equal 200 micrometer thick, totally depleted silicon surface  barrier detectors.

The orientations  of the telescope axes are such that there is  nearly a complete 41r coverage of the unit sphere during  one complete spacecraft spin.     In the LEFS 60 and LEFS 120 telescopes, a thin  ( ~0.35 mg cm-2) aluminized parylene foil prevents ions  (~350 keV) from reaching the F and F' detector, while  electrons (~30 keV) can penetrate the foil with little  energy loss.

Much of this is shared equipment, being used       for routine telecommunications as well as for radio science.       The performance and calibration of both the spacecraft and       tracking stations directly affect the radio science data       accuracy, and they play a major role in determining the quality       of the results. The spacecraft part of the radio science       instrument is described immediately below. This is followed       by a description of the DSN (ground) part of the instrument.         Instrument Specifications - Spacecraft     ======================================       The Ulysses spacecraft telecommunications subsystem (TCSS) was       utilized for radio science investigations of the solar corona.       The 'build date' is taken as 1986-01-01. No changes to the       spacecraft were made after this date, which was prior to the       originally scheduled launch in May 1986.

Each transponder included an S-band       receiver (2112 MHz), a modulator, a 5-watt S-band power       amplifier (2293 MHz), and an X-band exciter (8408 MHz). The       output from either X-band exciter could be used to drive one of       two redundant 20-watt traveling wave tube amplifiers. Each       downlink signal could be made coherent with the S-band uplink       in a frequency ratio 240/221 at S-band and 880/221 at X-band.         The spacecraft used a 1.653 meter parabolic antenna with dual       feeds. The antenna and its X-band pattern were aligned with the       spacecraft spin axis. The S-band boresight was offset from the       spin axis by 1.8 degrees. The spacecraft attitude control system       processed the uplink radio signal and output from a sun sensor to       maintain antenna pointing toward Earth. All radio links were       designed to use right-hand circular polarization; but the 1.8       degree offset caused the S-band downlink to have elliptical       polarization with an axial ratio of approximately 2.         Descriptions given here are for nominal performance. The       spacecraft transponder system comprised redundant units, each       with slightly different characteristics. As transponder units age,       their performance changes slightly. More importantly, the       performance for radio science depended on operational factors such       as the modulation state for the transmitters, which cannot be       predicted in advance. The performance also depended on factors       which were not always under the control of the Ulysses Project.

Dual-frequency ranging and Doppler data       were collected near solar conjunction to determine the density,       velocity, and turbulence of coronal plasma at solar distances       below 40 solar radii, i.e. within the zone of solar wind       acceleration. Dual-frequency Doppler data were recorded during       the Ulysses gravity assist at Jupiter in order to measure the       electron content of the Io Plasma Torus [BIRDETAL1992A].           Solar Corona Measurements       -------------------------         Dual-frequency ranging measurements were used to infer the         total electron content (column density) along the radio path.         Dual-frequency Doppler measurements are 100 times more         sensitive to CHANGES in electron content, but cannot be used to         determine the ABSOLUTE value of the content. SCE measured the         electron content and its variations during the first solar         conjunction (C1) of the Ulysses mission in the summer of 1991         as well as the fourth solar conjunction (C4) in the winter of         1995. The ranging data have been analyzed for C1 and results         have been published [PAETZOLDETAL1992; BIRDETAL1994;         WOOETAL1995A; WOOETAL1995B; WOO1996; PAETZOLDETAL1997]. Ranging         results from the geometrically unique fourth Ulysses solar         conjunction (C4) have also been reported [PAETZOLDETAL1995;         BIRDETAL1996; WOO&HABBAL1997; PAETZOLD&BIRD1998;         WOO&HABBAL1998]. Coronal velocities as a function of solar         distance were derived from the C1 Doppler data using a         correlation technique between uplink and downlink         [WOHLMUTHETAL1997] and between two simultaneously tracking         ground stations [JANARDHANETAL1999]. Differences in the         spectral characteristics of electron density fluctuations         observed in coronal holes vs. corona streamers were reported         from analyses of the C4 Doppler data [PAETZOLDETAL1996;         KARLETAL1997].           Io Plasma Torus Measurements       ----------------------------         The Ulysses radio downlinks were monitored during the         spacecraft's passage through the Io Plasma Torus (IPT) shortly         after closest approach to Jupiter on 1992-02-08. The electron         content of the IPT was derived from the differential phase shift         of the S-band signal with respect to the X-band signal. In         contrast to the only previous IPT occultation experiment with         the Voyager spacecraft, the radio raypath to earth cut through         the torus while Jupiter was nearly at opposition, thereby         greatly reducing interference from the interplanetary medium and         terrestrial ionosphere. The unusual north-to-south encounter         trajectory was particularly favorable for investigating the         latitudinal extent of the IPT. Possible azimuthal variations         could also be addressed, because the signal ray path sliced         through distinct IPT sectors in front of and behind Jupiter,         respectively, at different times and at different relative         speeds. Model parameters derived from the best-fit electron         content profiles for these sectors implied significant         longitudinal IPT asymmetry, thereby substantiating the earlier         Voyager results. [BIRDETAL1992B; BIRDETAL1993].         Operational Considerations - Spacecraft     =======================================       The standard radio subsystem configuration for the SCE       investigation was somewhat different from previous deep space       radio sounding experiments. In order to achieve coherency with the       received S-band uplink, the TCSS was designed to enable either       S-band receiver, selected by command, to drive the downlinks from       either or both transponders. When transmitting both downlinks,       however, the S-band and X-band links had to be generated from       different transponders. As a result, the intrinsic transponder       group delay was slightly different under the various switching       combinations and needed to be calibrated. This 'spacecraft delay'       was assumed to be constant over the course of the mission.         Calibration Description - Spacecraft     ====================================       First in-flight tests were conducted between 1990-12-03 and       1991-01-05 when the spacecraft was about 5e10 m (0.35 AU) from       Earth and the solar elongation angle was about 145 deg. This       geometry afforded a calibration of the radio sounding instrument       under conditions with a relatively small interplanetary plasma       content. The intrinsic sensitivity of the Doppler measurements       from these data, expressed in terms of columnar content, was       determined to be less than 0.1e16 electrons per square meter.         Platform Mounting Descriptions - Spacecraft     ===========================================       The S-band boresight was 1.8 degrees off the spin axis.       The high-gain antenna and X-band boresight were aligned with       the spacecraft spin axis, normally pointed toward Earth.         Principal Investigators     =======================       The Team Leaders for the SCE investigation were H. Volland       (pre-launch) and  M. K. Bird (post-launch), both at the       Radioastronomisches Inst., Univ. Bonn, Bonn, Germany.         Instrument Section / Operating Mode Descriptions - Spacecraft     =============================================================       During the solar conjunctions and the IPT occultation, standard       SCE operations required that the Ulysses TCSS be configured to       transmit dual-frequency downlinks at S-band and X-band, both       downlinks coherently driven by the S-band uplink. For a brief       period around the first solar conjunction, the spin axis was       off-pointed from Earth (and Sun) as part of a specially designed       sun avoidance maneuver. This was necessary in order to       continuously measure the attitude control spin pulses from the       spacecraft's sun sensor. One result of this was loss of signal       strength at the closest solar offset distances and degradation of       radio sounding data quantity and quality.         Instrument Overview - DSN     =========================       Three Deep Space Communications Complexes (DSCCs) (near Barstow,       CA; Canberra, Australia; and Madrid, Spain) comprise the DSN       tracking network. Each complex is equipped with several antennas,       including at least one each 70-m, 34-m High Efficiency (HEF), and       34-m standard (STD), associated electronics, and operational       systems. Primary activity at each complex is radiation of commands       to and reception of telemetry data from active spacecraft.       Transmission and reception is possible in several radio-frequency       bands, the most common being S-band (nominally a frequency of       2100-2300 MHz or a wavelength of 14.2-13.0 cm) and X-band (7100-       8500 MHz or 4.2-3.5 cm). Transmitter output powers of up to       400 kw are available.         Ground stations have the ability to transmit coded and uncoded       waveforms which can be echoed by distant spacecraft. Analysis of       the received coding allows navigators to determine the distance to       the spacecraft; analysis of Doppler shift on the carrier signal       allows estimation of the line-of-sight spacecraft velocity. Range       and Doppler measurements are used to calculate the spacecraft       trajectory and to infer gravity fields of objects near the       spacecraft.         Ground stations can record spacecraft signals that have       propagated through or been scattered from target media.       Measurements of signal parameters after wave interactions with       surfaces, atmospheres, rings, and plasmas are used to infer       physical and electrical properties of the target.         Principal investigators vary from experiment to experiment. See       the corresponding section of the spacecraft instrument       description or the data set description for specifics.         The Deep Space Network is managed by the Jet Propulsion       Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology for the       U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

Subsystems - DSN     ================       The Deep Space Communications Complexes (DSCCs) are an integral       part of the Radio Science instrument, along with other       receiving stations and the spacecraft Radio Frequency       Subsystem. Their system performance directly determines the       degree of success of Radio Science investigations, and their       system calibration determines the degree of accuracy in the       results of the experiments. The following paragraphs describe       the functions performed by the individual subsystems of a DSCC.       This material has been adapted from [ASMAR&HERRERA1993]; for       additional information, consult [DSMS810-005].         Each DSCC includes a set of antennas, a Signal Processing       Center (SPC), and communication links to the Jet Propulsion       Laboratory (JPL). The general configuration is illustrated       below; antennas (Deep Space Stations, or DSS -- a term carried       over from earlier times when antennas were individually       instrumented) are listed in the table.             --------   --------   --------   --------   --------          | DSS 12 | | DSS 18 | | DSS 14 | | DSS 15 | | DSS 16 |          |34-m STD| |34-m STD| |  70-m  | |34-m HEF| |  26-m  |           --------   --------   --------   --------   --------               |            |     |             |          |               |            v     v             |          v               |           ---------            |     ---------                --------->|GOLDSTONE|<----------     |EARTH/ORB|                          | SPC  10 |<-------------->|   LINK  |                           ---------                  ---------                          |   SPC   |<-------------->|   26-M  |                          |  COMM   |         ------>|   COMM  |                           ---------         |        ---------                               |             |            |                               v             |            v              ------       ---------         |        ---------             | NOCC |<--->|   JPL   |<-------        |         |              ------      | CENTRAL |                |   GSFC  |              ------      |   COMM  |                | NASCOMM |             | MCCC |<--->| TERMINAL|<-------------->|         |              ------       ---------                  ---------                                                       ^     ^                                                       |     |                    CANBERRA (SPC 40) <----------------      |                                                             |                      MADRID (SPC 60) <----------------------                             GOLDSTONE     CANBERRA      MADRID              Antenna        SPC 10       SPC 40       SPC 60             --------      ---------     --------     --------             26-m            DSS 16       DSS 46       DSS 66             34-m STD        DSS 12       DSS 42       DSS 61                             DSS 18       DSS 48       DSS 68             34-m HEF        DSS 15       DSS 45       DSS 65             70-m            DSS 14       DSS 43       DSS 63             Developmental   DSS 13           Subsystem interconnections at each DSCC are shown in the       diagram below, and they are described in the sections that       follow.

The DMC is the center of activity at a DSCC. The         DMC receives and archives most of the information from the         NOCC needed by the various DSCC subsystems during their         operation. Control of most of the DSCC subsystems, as well         as the handling and displaying of any responses to control         directives and configuration and status information received         from each of the subsystems, is done through the DMC. The         effect of this is to centralize the control, display, and         archiving functions necessary to operate a DSCC.         Communication among the various subsystems is done using a         Local Area Network (LAN) hooked up to each subsystem via a         network interface unit (NIU).           DMC operations are divided into two separate areas: the         Complex Monitor and Control (CMC) and the Link Monitor and         Control (LMC). The primary purpose of the CMC processor for         Radio Science support is to receive and store all predict         sets transmitted from NOCC such as Radio Science, antenna         pointing, tracking, receiver, and uplink predict sets and         then, at a later time, to distribute them to the appropriate         subsystems via the LAN. Those predict sets can be stored in         the CMC for a maximum of three days under normal conditions.         The CMC also receives, processes, and displays event/alarm         messages; maintains an operator log; and produces tape labels         for the DSP. Assignment and configuration of the LMCs is         done through the CMC; to a limited degree the CMC can perform         some of the functions performed by the LMC. There are two         CMCs (one on-line and one backup) and three LMCs at each DSCC         The backup CMC can function as an additional LMC if         necessary.           The LMC processor provides the operator interface for monitor         and control of a link -- a group of equipment required to         support a spacecraft pass. For Radio Science, a link might         include the DSCC Spectrum Processing Subsystem (DSP) (which,         in turn, can control the SSI), or the Tracking Subsystem.         The LMC also maintains an operator log which includes         operator directives and subsystem responses. One important         Radio Science specific function that the LMC performs is         receipt and transmission of the system temperature and signal         level data from the PPM for display at the LMC console and         for inclusion in Monitor blocks. These blocks are recorded         on magnetic tape as well as appearing in the Mission Control         and Computing Center (MCCC) displays. The LMC is required to         operate without interruption for the duration of the Radio         Science data acquisition period.           The Area Routing Assembly (ARA), which is part of the Digital         Communications Subsystem, controls all data communication         between the stations and JPL. The ARA receives all required         data and status messages from the LMC/CMC and can record them         to tape as well as transmit them to JPL via data lines. The         ARA also receives predicts and other data from JPL and passes         them on to the CMC.           DSCC Antenna Mechanical Subsystem       ---------------------------------         Multi-mission Radio Science activities require support from         the 70-m, 34-m HEF, and 34-m STD antenna subnets. The         antennas at each DSCC function as large-aperture collectors         which, by double reflection, cause the incoming radio         frequency (RF) energy to enter the feed horns. The large         collecting surface of the antenna focuses the incoming energy         onto a subreflector, which is adjustable in both axial and         angular position. These adjustments are made to correct for         gravitational deformation of the antenna as it moves between         zenith and the horizon; the deformation can be as large as         5 cm. The subreflector adjustments optimize the channeling         of energy from the primary reflector to the subreflector         and then to the feed horns. The 70-m and 34-m HEF antennas         have 'shaped' primary and secondary reflectors, with forms         that are modified paraboloids. This customization allows         more uniform illumination of one reflector by another. The         34-m STD primary reflectors are classical paraboloids, while         the subreflectors are standard hyperboloids.           On the 70-m and 34-m STD antennas, the subreflector directs         received energy from the antenna onto a dichroic plate, a         device which reflects S-band energy to the S-band feed horn         and passes X-band energy through to the X-band feed horn. In         the 34-m HEF, there is one 'common aperture feed,' which         accepts both frequencies without requiring a dichroic plate.         RF energy to be transmitted into space by the horns is         focused by the reflectors into narrow cylindrical beams,         pointed with high precision (either to the dichroic plate or         directly to the subreflector) by a series of drive motors and         gear trains that can rotate the movable components and their         support structures.           The different antennas can be pointed by several means. Two         pointing modes commonly used during tracking passes are         CONSCAN and 'blind pointing.' With CONSCAN enabled and a         closed loop receiver locked to a spacecraft signal, the         system tracks the radio source by conically scanning around         its position in the sky. Pointing angle adjustments are         computed from signal strength information (feedback) supplied         by the receiver. In this mode the Antenna Pointing Assembly         (APA) generates a circular scan pattern which is sent to the         Antenna Control System (ACS). The ACS adds the scan pattern         to the corrected pointing angle predicts. Software in the         receiver-exciter controller computes the received signal         level and sends it to the APA. The correlation of scan         position with the received signal level variations allows the         APA to compute offset changes which are sent to the ACS.         Thus, within the capability of the closed-loop control         system, the scan center is pointed precisely at the apparent         direction of the spacecraft signal source. An additional         function of the APA is to provide antenna position angles and         residuals, antenna control mode/status information, and         predict-correction parameters to the Area Routing Assembly         (ARA) via the LAN, which then sends this information to JPL         via the Ground Communications Facility (GCF) for antenna         status monitoring.           During periods when excessive signal level dynamics or low         received signal levels are expected (e.g., during an         occultation experiment), CONSCAN should not be used. Under         these conditions, blind pointing (CONSCAN OFF) is used, and         pointing angle adjustments are based on a predetermined         Systematic Error Correction (SEC) model.           Independent of CONSCAN state, subreflector motion in at least         the z-axis may introduce phase variations into the received         Radio Science data. For that reason, during certain         experiments, the subreflector in the 70-m and 34-m HEFs may         be frozen in the z-axis at a position (often based on         elevation angle) selected to minimize phase change and signal         degradation. This can be done via Operator Control Inputs         (OCIs) from the LMC to the Subreflector Controller (SRC)         which resides in the alidade room of the antennas. The SRC         passes the commands to motors that drive the subreflector to         the desired position. Unlike the 70-m and 34-m HEFs which         have azimuth-elevation (AZ-EL) drives, the 34-m STD antennas         use (hour angle-declination) HA-DEC drives. The same         positioning of the subreflector on the 34-m STD does not         create the same effect as on the 70-m and 34-m HEFs.           Pointing angles for all three antenna types are computed by         the NOCC Support System (NSS) from an ephemeris provided by         the flight project. These predicts are received and archived         by the CMC. Before each track, they are transferred to the         APA, which transforms the direction cosines of the predicts         into AZ-EL coordinates for the 70-m and 34-m HEFs or into         HA-DEC coordinates for the 34-m STD antennas. The LMC         operator then downloads the antenna AZ-EL or HA-DEC predict         points to the antenna-mounted ACS computer along with a         selected SEC model. The pointing predicts consist of         time-tagged AZ-EL or HA-DEC points at selected time intervals         along with polynomial coefficients for interpolation between         points.           The ACS automatically interpolates the predict points,         corrects the pointing predicts for refraction and         subreflector position, and adds the proper systematic error         correction and any manually entered antenna offsets. The ACS         then sends angular position commands for each axis at the         rate of one per second. In the 70-m and 34-m HEF, rate         commands are generated from the position commands at the         servo controller and are subsequently used to steer the         antenna. In the 34-m STD antennas motors, rather than         servos, are used to steer the antenna; there is no feedback         once the 34-m STD has been told where to point.           When not using binary predicts (the routine mode for         spacecraft tracking), the antennas can be pointed using         'planetary mode' -- a simpler mode which uses right ascension         (RA) and declination (DEC) values. These change very slowly         with respect to the celestial frame. Values are provided to         the station in text form for manual entry. The ACS         quadratically interpolates among three RA and DEC points         which are on one-day centers.           A third pointing mode -- sidereal -- is available for         tracking radio sources fixed with respect to the celestial         frame.           Regardless of the pointing mode being used, a 70-m antenna         has a special high-accuracy pointing capability called         'precision' mode. A pointing control loop derives the         main AZ-EL pointing servo drive error signals from a two-         axis autocollimator mounted on the Intermediate Reference         Structure. The autocollimator projects a light beam to a         precision mirror mounted on the Master Equatorial drive         system, a much smaller structure, independent of the main         antenna, which is exactly positioned in HA and DEC with shaft         encoders. The autocollimator detects elevation/cross-         elevation errors between the two reference surfaces by         measuring the angular displacement of the reflected light         beam. This error is compensated for in the antenna servo by         moving the antenna in the appropriate AZ-EL direction.         Pointing accuracies of 0.004 degrees (15 arc seconds) are         possible in 'precision' mode. The 'precision' mode is not         available on 34-m antennas -- nor is it needed, since their         beamwidths are twice as large as on the 70-m antennas.           DSCC Antenna Microwave Subsystem       --------------------------------         70-m Antennas: Each 70-m antenna has three feed cones         installed in a structure at the center of the main reflector.         The feeds are positioned 120 degrees apart on a circle.         Selection of the feed is made by rotation of the         subreflector. A dichroic mirror assembly, half on the S-band         cone and half on the X-band cone, permits simultaneous use of         the S- and X-band frequencies. The third cone is devoted to         R&D and more specialized work.           The Antenna Microwave Subsystem (AMS) accepts the received S-         and X-band signals at the feed horn and transmits them         through polarizer plates to an orthomode transducer. The         polarizer plates are adjusted so that the signals are         directed to a pair of redundant amplifiers for each         frequency, thus allowing simultaneous reception of signals in         two orthogonal polarizations. For S-band these are two Block         IVA S-band Traveling Wave Masers (TWMs); for X-band the         amplifiers are Block IIA TWMs.           34-m STD Antennas: These antennas have two feed horns, one         for S-band signals and one for X-band. The horns are mounted         on a cone which is fixed in relation to the subreflector. A         dichroic plate mounted above the horns directs energy from         the subreflector into the proper horn.           The AMS directs the received S- and X-band signals through         polarizer plates and on to amplification. There are two         Block III S-band TWMs and two Block I X-band TWMs.           34-m HEF Antennas: Unlike the other antennas, the 34-m HEF         uses a single feed for both S- and X-band. Simultaneous S-         and X-band receive as well as X-band transmit is possible         thanks to the presence of an S/X 'combiner' which acts as a         diplexer. For S-band, RCP or LCP is user selected through a         switch so neither a polarizer nor an orthomode transducer is         needed. X-band amplification options include two Block II         TWMs or an HEMT Low Noise Amplifier (LNA). S-band         amplification is provided by an FET LNA.           DSCC Receiver-Exciter Subsystem       -------------------------------         The Receiver-Exciter Subsystem is composed of three groups of         equipment: the closed-loop receiver group, the open-loop         receiver group, and the RF monitor group. This subsystem is         controlled by the Receiver-Exciter Controller (REC) which         communicates directly with the DMC for predicts and OCI         reception and st",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The instrument, which covers an energy per     charge range from 0.16 to 59.6 keV/e in ~ 13 min, combines an     electrostatic analyzer with post-acceleration, followed by a     time-of-flight and energy measurement.  The measurements made     by SWICS will have an impact on many areas of solar and     heliospheric physics, in particular providing essential and     unique information on: (i) conditions and processes in the     region of the corona where the solar wind is accelerated, (ii)     the location of the source regions of the solar wind in the     corona; (iii) coronal heating processes; (iv) the extent and     causes of variations in the composition of the solar     atmosphere; (v)plasma processes in the solar wind; (vi) the     acceleration of energetic particles in the solar wind; (vii)     the thermalization and acceleration of interstellar ions in the     solar wind, and their composition; and (viii) the composition,     charge states and behavior of the plasma in various regions of     the Jovian magnetosphere.

urn:esa:psa:context:instrument:uly.swoops,SOLAR WIND OBSERVATIONS OVER THE POLES OF THE SUN for ULY,SOLAR WIND OBSERVATIONS OVER THE POLES OF THE SUN,"       Instrument Overview   ===================     (excerpted from: [BAMEETAL1992A])       Abstract.  -- The Solar Wind Plasma Experiment on Ulysses is     accurately characterizing the bulk flow and internal state     conditions of the interplanetary plasma in three dimensions on     the way out to Jupiter.  These observations will continue over     the full range of heliocentric distances and heliographic     latitudes reached by the probe after its encounter with Jupiter     and consequent deflection out of the ecliptic plane.  Solar     wind electrons and ions are measured simultaneously with     independent curved-plate electrostatic analyzers equipped with     multiple Channel Electron Multipliers (CEMs).  The CEMs are     arranged to detect particles at chosen polar angles from the     spacecraft spin axis; resolution in spacecraft azimuth is     obtained by timing measurements with the spacecraft Sun clock     as the spacecraft spins.  Electrons with central energies     extending from 0.86 eV to 814 eV are detected at seven polar     angles and various combinations of azimuth angle to cover the     unit sphere comprehensively, so as to enable computation of the     pertinent electron velocity distribution parameters.  As the     average electron flux level changes with heliocentric distance,     command control of the CEM counting intervals is used to extend     the dynamic range.  Ions are detected between 255 eV/q and 34.4     keV/q using appropriate subsets of 16 CEMs at spin angles     designed to provide matrices of counts as a function of energy     per charge, azimuth angle, and polar angle centered on the     average direction of solar-wind flow.  Data matrices are     obtained every 4 min when the spacecraft is actively     transmitting and every 8 min during data store periods.  These     matrices contain sufficient energy and angle resolution to     permit a detailed characterization of the ion velocity     distributions, from which ion bulk parameters are derived.  As     the average ion flux intensity changes with heliocentric     distance, the entrance aperture size is periodically optimized     by command selection from a set of seven apertures on a disk     driven by a stepping motor.  Changes in the average solar wind     flow direction relative to the Earth-pointing spacecraft spin     axis are accommodated by command selection of the proper     measurement matrix from a set of 11 matrices.  In a separate     mode of operation and under favorable conditions, heavy ions of     oxygen, silicon, and iron at various charge levels are     resolved.

urn:esa:psa:context:instrument:uly.udds,ULYSSES DUST DETECTION SYSTEM for ULY,ULYSSES DUST DETECTION SYSTEM,"     Instrument Overview   ===================     The instrument consists of a 0.1 mm thick gold foil of hemispherical     shape with three grids at the entrance (entrance grid, charge grid,     and shield), as well as an ion collector and channeltron detector.     The maximum sensitive area (for particles moving parallel to the     sensor axis) is 0.1 m**2.  Upon impact the particle produces a     plasma, whose charge carriers are separated by an electric field     between the target and the ion collector.  Negative charges (mainly     electrons) are collected at the target. The positive charges are     collected partly by the ion collector and partly by a channeltron.     The channeltron is used as it is insensitive to electric and     vibrational noise.  See Gruen et al. (1992b) [GRUENETAL1992B] for     more information concerning the instrument.       Science Objectives Summary   ==========================     The objective of the Ulysses dust experiment is to investigate the     physical and dynamical properties of small dust particles (10**-16     to 10**-6g) as a function of ecliptic latitude and heliocentric     distance, and the study of their interrelation with     interplanetary/interstellar phenomena.  The parameters to be     determined include the mass, speed, flight direction and electric     charge of individual particles.  Specific objectives are:       - To determine the impact rate, size frequency, and the distribution       of flight directions and electric charges of interplanetary dust       particles     - To classify particle orbits into bound orbits around the Sun or       hyperbolic orbits leaving or entering the solar system     - To study the distributions of orbital elements (semi-major axis,       eccentricity, inclination ) of particles in bound orbits     - To determine as functions of heliocentric distance and ecliptic       latitude the spatial density of the interplanetary large particle       population which generally moves in bound orbits around the sun,       and to determine the relative significance of comets and asteroids       as sources for these zodiacal dust particles     - To measure the flux and velocity of particles coming in hyperbolic       orbits from the general direction of the Sun     - To identify interstellar dust particles and perform direct       measurements of the spatial density, heliocentric distribution,       velocity and mass of interstellar grains traversing the solar       system     - To observe enhancements of cometary dust particles during the       transit of the spacecraft through the plane of a comet's orbit     - To investigate the spatial density of dust particles within the       asteroid belt and determine the amount of dust produced by       collisions in the asteroid belt     - To investigate the influence of the Jovian gravitational field on       the interplanetary dust population     - To measure electric charges of dust particles and establish the       relationship of these charges to the properties of the ambient       plasma (plasma density, energy spectrum), the solar radiation       spectrum and magnetic fields       Instrument Measurements   =======================     Positively or negatively charged particles entering the sensor are     first detected via the charge which they induce in the charge grid     while flying between the entrance and shield grids.  The grids     adjacent to the charge pick-up grid are kept at the same potential     in order to minimize the susceptibility of the charge measurement to     mechanical noise.  All dust particles - charged or uncharged - are     detected by the ionization they produce during the impact on the     hemispherical impact sensor.  After separation by an electric field,     the ions and electrons of the plasma are accumulated by charge     sensitive amplifiers (CSA), thus delivering two coincident pulses of     opposite polarity.  The rise times of the pulses, which are     independent of the particle mass, decrease with increasing particle     speed.  From both the pulse heights and rise times, the mass and     impact speed of the dust particles are derived by using empirical     correlations between these four quantities.       Detector Description   ====================     The sensor consists of a grid system for the measurement of the     particle charge, an electrically grounded target (hemisphere) and a     negatively biased ion collector.  A charged dust particle entering     the sensor will induce a charge in the charge grid, which is     connected to a charge sensitive amplifier.  The output voltage of     this amplifier rises until the particle passes this grid, and falls     off to zero when it reaches the shield grid.  The peak value (Q_p)     is stored for a maximum of 600 microseconds and is only processed if     an impact is detected by the impact ionization detector within this     time.  A dust particle hitting the hemispherical target produces     electrons and ions, which are separated by the electric field     between hemisphere and ion collector into negative charges     (electrons and negative ions) and positive ions.  The negative     charges are collected at the hemisphere and measured by a charge     sensitive amplifier (Q_e).  Positive ions are collected and measured     at the negatively biased ion collector with a charge sensitive     amplifier (Q_i).  Some of the ions penetrate the ion collector     (which is partly transparent - total transmission approximately 40     percent), are further accelerated, and hit the entrance cone of an     electron multiplier (channeltron).  Secondary electrons are     produced, amplified, and measured by a charge sensitive amplifier     (Q_c).  Other quantities measured are the rise times of both the     positive and negative charge pulses.  The measurement of the time     delay between electron pulse and ion pulse serves as a means for     distinguishing impact events from noise.  Impact events have time     delays of 2-50 microseconds, while mechanical noise has a time delay     of milliseconds.  These signal amplitudes and times of a single     recorded event are digitized and stored in an Experiment Data Frame     (EDF).       A measurement cycle is initiated if either the negative charge Q_e     on the hemispherical target, or the positive charge Q_i on the     ion-collector, or the positive charge Q-c on the channeltron exceeds     a threshold. Since the hemisphere has a large area which is directly     exposed to interplanetary plasma and high-energy radiation, this may     cause some interference for the Q_e measurement.  To avoid this     interference during high activity times, it is possible to switch by     command to a mode in which a measurement cycle is initiated if only     the charge on the ion collector Q_i (small area and not directly     exposed) or channeltron signal Q_c exceeds the threshold.  If more     than one event occurs within the transmission time of one EDF, then     these events are counted by several amplitude-dependent counters.     The dead-time caused by the measurement cycles is 5 milliseconds.       The signals from the sensor are conditioned and analysed.  The     microprocessor coordinates the experiment measurement cycle,     collects the buffered measurement data and processes the data     according to a program stored in the memory.       Calibration Description   =======================     Impact tests with iron, carbon, and silicate particles were     performed at the Heidelberg dust accelerator facility.  The     particles were in the speed range from 1 to 70 km/s and in the mass     range from 1.0E-15 to 1.0E-10 grams.  In addition to the projectile     material variation, calibrations for iron particles with varying     impact angles were done.  See Goller and Gruen (1989) for more     information.       To obtain calibrations without information about the impact angle     and the composition of an impacting micrometeoroid, a set of curves     (one for each measurement channel) was calculated, which were     averaged over three different materials (iron, carbon, and silicate)     and over the range of relevant impact angles (20 to 53 degrees).     The measurements were done at different angles with iron particles     and at one fixed angle (20 degrees) with carbon and silicate     projectiles.  Difficulties in accelerating glass and carbon     projectiles and the low acceleration rate made it impossible to do     tests at more than one angle.       A computer simulation of the detector exposed to an isotropic     particle flux leads to the result that 50 percent of the particles     hit the detector under an angle of 32 degrees or lower, relative to     the sensor axis.  Its effective viewing cone covers a solid angle of     1.4 sr.  As the target is curved (hemispherical) the impact angle,     measured relative to the target normal at the point of impact, is     generally different from the angle of incidence (relative to the     sensor axis).  The direction of travel of the impacting particle can     not be determined.  From the computer simulation the most probable     impact angle is 28 degrees, the average angle is 36 degrees.  This     information, used with the pointing of the instrument, can be used     to obtain a rough estimate of the particle trajectory.  The     particle's flight path inside the detector was determined to be 20     +/- 5 cm.       There are three possibilities for the determination of a particle's     speed (the risetimes and the ratio Q_c/Q_i).  Using all three     measurements and comparing them with the calibration curves, the     speed can be determined with an accuracy of a factor of 1.6. Using     only one the accuracy is given by a factor of 2.       With a known particle speed the mass can be determined from the     charge yields Q_i/m and Q_e/m.  If the speed is known within a     factor of 1.6 and both yields are used for mass measurements the     value can be measured with an uncertainty of a factor of 6.  The     main part of this error is caused by the limited accuracy of the     speed measurement.  The smallest impact charge Q_i detectable is     about 10**14 coulomb which corresponds to a mass and speed dependent     threshold that can be approximated by a power law (see Gruen et al.,     1995a).       Instrument Modes   ================     Different instrument modes exist to alter the instrument's     susceptibility to noise.  These modes are changed by adjusting the     thresholds of the detectors aboard the instrument.  The thresholds     are altered by telecommand from Earth.  The threshold levels of the     detectors are included within the dataset.       Onboard Processing   ==================     See Gruen et al, 1992b and 1995c [GRUENETAL1992B],     [GRUENETAL1995C].       First, the instrument microprocessor, which controls the experiment     measurement cycle, collects the buffered data and processes the data     according to its onboard program. This takes about 5 ms.  The signal     amplitudes and times of a single recorded event (dust impact or     noise) are digitized and stored in an Experiment Data Frame (EDF) of     16 bytes (i.e. 128 bits). Supplementary information like event time     and instantaneous spin position are collected from the spacecraft     and added in each EDF. Dead-time caused by the measurement cycle is     5 ms.       The instruments are designed to reliably operate under noisy     conditions thereby allowing the reliable extraction of true dust     impacts from noise events. True impacts can be detected at rates of     as low as one per month.  This is achieved by raising the threshold     levels of all impact signals individually by telecommand which     allows instrument sensitivity to be adapted to the actual noise     environment on board the spacecraft.  Coincidences between the     signals are established which, along with the signal amplitudes, are     used to classify each event.       Each measured event (noise or impact) is classified according to the     strength of its ion signal (IA) into one of six amplitude ranges     (AR=1 to 6). Each amplitude range correspond roughly to one decade     in electronic charge, Q_I. In addition, each event is categorized     into one of four event classes (described by the class number CLN).     The event classification scheme, which defines criteria that must be     satisfied for each class, is shown:    --------------------------------------------------------------------------  Parameters:  |  CLN=0  |  CLN=1  |       CLN=2        |       CLN=3  --------------------------------------------------------------------------     IA        |  IA > 0 |  IA > 0 |       IA > 0       |       IA > SP16  -------------|    or   |    or   |----------------------------------------     EA        |  EA > 0 |  EA > 0 |       EA > 0       |       EA > SP14  -------------|    or   |--------------------------------------------------     CA        |  CA > 0 |  CA > 0 |       CA > 0       |       CA > SP15  --------------------------------------------------------------------------     ET        |         |         | SP03 <= ET <= SP04 | SP03 <= ET <= SP04  --------------------------------------------------------------------------     IT        |         |         | SP01 <= IT <= SP02 | SP01 <= IT <= SP02  --------------------------------------------------------------------------     EIC       |         |         |       EIC = 0      |      EIC = 0  --------------------------------------------------------------------------     ICC       |         |         |       ICC = 1      |      ICC = 1  --------------------------------------------------------------------------  Noise counter|         |         |                    |  of:          |         |         |                    |     EN        |         |         |                    |      EN <= SP11     IN        |         |         |                    |      IN <= SP09     CN        |         |         |                    |      CN <= SP10  --------------------------------------------------------------------------       Within each class these conditions are connected by logical 'and'     except where noted. Class 0 (CLN = 0) includes all events that are     not categorized in a higher class (typically noise and unusual     impact events - e.g. impacts onto the sensor's internal structure     other than the impact target).  In classes 1 through 3, the criteria     become increasingly restricted so that CLN = 3 generally represents     true dust impact events only. Some of the set point values (SP01 to     SP15), which can be set by ground command, are used in the     classification scheme. The set points are as follows:                           SP01         =  1                         SP02         = 15                         SP03         =  1                         SP04         = 15                         SP09         =  2                         SP10         =  8                         SP11         =  8                         SP14         =  0                         SP15         =  0                         SP16         =  0       The on board classification can be adapted to the in-flight noise     environment by changing the thresholds and classification parameters     (set points) or by adjusting the onboard classification program     through telecommands. Detailed information on noise is mandatory in     order to evaluate the reliability of impact detection for the     various event categories, to minimize the effect on dead-time and to     optimize memory utilization.       The memory is divided into separate ranges in which various data is     given priority. The A-range of instrument memory stores the six most     recent EDFs - one for each amplitude range regardless of class. The     E range, graphically depicted below, stores the last 8 events     occurring within class 3. These events satisfy the most stringent     constraints and are almost certainly true impacts.       The above four classes, together with six amplitude ranges,     constitute twenty-four separate categories. Each of these categories     has its own 8-bit accumulator:                       |         |    Class number (CLN)                     |Amplitude|                IA   |  Range  |  0      1      2      3              -------------------------------------------        0- 7 | AR         = 1  | AC01 | AC11 | AC21 | AC31        8-15 | AR         = 2  | AC02 | AC12 | AC22 | AC32       16-23 | AR         = 3  | AC03 | AC13 | AC23 | AC33       24-32 | AR         = 4  | AC04 | AC14 | AC24 | AC34       48-55 | AR         = 5  | AC05 | AC15 | AC25 | AC35       56-63 | AR         = 6  | AC06 | AC16 | AC26 | AC36       As long as the respective accumulator does not overflow, each event     is counted even if the complete information is not received on     ground.  Generally, the event rate is so low (even in the low     amplitude and low class ranges) that the true increment can be     reliably determined. All categories and corresponding accumulators -     excluding AC01, AC11 and AC02 - contain primarily impact events.     Even in these latter categories, true impacts can be identified and     separated from noise events if the complete data set for an event is     available [BAGUHLETAL1993].       The transmission of seven EDFs constitute an instrument read-out     cycle (six A-range events and one of the subcommutated class 3     events as well as all 24 accumulators) which is continuously     repeated. The Ulysses mission is designed to provide continuous data     coverage even when data transmission to Earth is only possible     during one pass of approximately 8 hours per day. Continuous     coverage is achieved by storing data from the instruments at a low     rate into an on-board memory which is read out at a high rate     together with real-time data transmission during a pass.  At a     spacecraft data transmission rate of 1024 bps, one EDF is sent every     16 seconds. Lower bit rates down to 128 bps during storage or real     time transmission periods are possible.       Data processing on the ground   =============================     After receiving the partially processed data from the spacecraft,     the following data processing steps are performed on the ground:            (1) instrument health check          (2) generation of accumulator histories          (3) extraction of discrete events          (4) reduction of impact data          (5) generation of data products       The instrument health check involves inspection of instrument house     keeping data such as temperatures, voltages, currents and a check of     the test pulse data. If, for example, the temperature readings are     too high, the heater power level can be set accordingly.       If excessive noise is detected then appropriate measures, such as     changing the thresholds or channeltron high voltage by telecommand,     can be taken.  Occasionally, tests of different instrument modes are     performed in order to probe the actual noise environment; the     instrument parameters can then be adjusted accordingly.       The preparation of data products is the final routine step of dust     data processing. A number of separate files are produced which     reflect various stages of data processing.       Instrument Mounting   ===================     The instrument is located on the equipment platform of the     spacecraft body and its axis is at an angle of 85 degrees with     respect to the positive z axis,  where the z axis is the rotation     axis of the spacecraft and the positive direction is where the axis     points roughly towards Earth.  The Ulysses dust detector weighs 3.8     kg and consumes 2.2 W.

urn:esa:psa:context:instrument:uly.urap,UNIFIED RADIO AND PLASMA WAVE EXPERIMENT for ULY,UNIFIED RADIO AND PLASMA WAVE EXPERIMENT,"       Instrument Overview   ===================     (excerpted from: [STONEETAL1992A])       Abstract.  -- The scientific objectives of the Ulysses Unifiewd     Radio and Plasma wave (URAP) experiment are twofold: 1) the     determination of the direction, angular size, and polarization     of radio sources for remote sensing of the heliosphere and the     Jovian magnetosphere and 2) the detailed study of local wave     phenomena, which determine the transport coefficients of the     ambient plasma.  The tracking of solar radio bursts, for     example, can provide three dimensional 'snap-shots' of the     large scale magnetic field configuration along which the solar     exciter particles propagate.  URAP observations of Jovian radio     emissions should greatly improve the determination of source     locations and consequently our understanding of the generation     mechanism(s) of planetary radio emissions.  The study of     observed wave-particle interactions will improve our     understanding of the processes that occur in the solar wind and     at Jupiter and of radio wave generation . . . .  The URAP     sensors consist of a 72.5 m electric field antenna in the spin     plane, a 7.5-m electric field monopole along the spin axis and     a pair of orthogonal search coil magnetic antennas.  The     various receivers, designed to encompass specific needs of the     investigation, cover the frequency range from DC to 1 MHz.  A     relaxation sounder provides very accurate electron density     measurements.  Radio and plasma wave observations are shown to     demonstrate the capabilities and limitations of the URAP     instruments: radio observations include solar bursts, auroral     kilometric radiation, and Jovian bursts; plasma waves include     Langmuir waves, ion acoustic-like noise, and whistlers.

urn:esa:psa:context:instrument:uly.vhm-fgm,VECTOR HELIUM/FLUXGATE MAGNETOMETERS for ULY,VECTOR HELIUM/FLUXGATE MAGNETOMETERS,"       Instrument Overview   ===================     (excerpted from: [BALOGHETAL1992A])       Abstract.  -- A fundamental feature of the heliosphere is the     three dimensional structure of the interplanetary magnetic     field.  The magnetic field investigation on Ulysses, the first     space probe to explore the out-of-ecliptic and polar     heliosphere, aims at determining the large scale features and     gradients of the field, as well as the heliolatitude dependence     of interplanetary phenomena so far only observed near the     ecliptic plane.  The Ulysses magnetometer uses two sensors, one     a Vector Helium Magnetometer, the other a Fluxgate     Magnetometer.  Onboard data processing yields measurements of     the magnetic field vector with a time resolution up to 2     vectors/second and a sensitivity of about 10 pT.  Since the     switch-on of the instrument in flight on 25 October 1990, a     steady stream of observations have been made, indicating that     at this phase of the solar cycle the field is generally     disturbed: several shock waves and a large number of     discontinuities have been observed, as well as several periods     with apparently intense wave activity.  The paper gives a brief     summary of the scientific objectives of the investigation,     followed by a detailed description of the instrument and its     characteristics.  Examples of wave bursts, interplanetary     shocks and crossings of the heliospheric current sheet are     given to illustrate the observations made with the instrument.

urn:esa:psa:context:instrument:vex.aspera4-els,Analyzer ,"ANALYZER OF SPACE PLASMA AND ENERGETIC ATOMS (4TH VERSION)
              Electron Spectrometer","       Instrument Overview      ===================      This is the ASPERA-4 (Analyzer of Space Plasmas and Energetic Atoms -      4th version) Electron Spectrometer (ELS) instrument description.        Analyzer of Space Plasmas and Energetic Atoms, 4th version (ASPERA-4)      Electron Spectrometer (ELS)      ---------------------------------------------------------------------      Abstract. The general scientific objective of the ASPERA-4 experiment      is to study the solar wind-atmosphere interaction and characterize      the plasma and neutral gas environment in the near-Venus space      through energetic neutral atom (ENA) imaging and local charged      particle measurements, in unprecedented detail and accuracy. The      studies to be performed would lead to a better understanding of the      origin and evolution of the planet, and particularly of induced      escape mechanisms responsible, among others, to the Venusian      atmosphere dehydration process.        The ASPERA-4 experiment is an instrument comprised of four different      sensors; two ENA sensors, electron and ion spectrometers. This      description only includes the electron spectrometer (ELS) instrument.      The electron spectrometer (ELS) is a standard top-hat electrostatic      analyzer in a very compact design. The ELS is located on a scanning      platform providing a 4pi coverage (maximum possible).        Electron Spectrometer (ELS)      ---------------------------      The ELectron Spectrometer (ELS) provides electron measurements in      the energy range 0.01 - 20 keV. The intrinsic field of view is      4 deg x 360 deg. The 360 deg aperture is divided into 16 sectors.      The sensor is a standard top-hat electrostatic analyzer in a very      compact design. The Venus Express Electron Spectrometer was built      at Southwest Research Institute as the flight spare for the Mars      Express mission under a NASA contract. IRF obtained approval from      NASA to use the Mars Express ELS flight spare for the Venus Express      ASPERA-4 ELS flight model.        Scientific Objectives      =====================      The ASPERA-4 ELS experiment helps fulfill the Venus Express mission      objective of studying the interaction of the atmosphere with the      interplanetary medium by in situ measurements of electrons in order          (a) to complement the ENA images (electrons cannot be imaged)         (b) to study local characteristics of plasma (dynamics and fine             structure of boundaries), and         (c) to provide undisturbed solar wind parameters.       The main scientific objective of the ASPERA-4 ELS instrument is to      define the local characteristics of the main plasma regions.      Associated measurements: Electron measurements of hot plasma      Measurement requirements: Electron measurements in the energy range      few eV - tens keV with 4pi coverage.        Calibration      ===========      Calibration of the ASPERA-4 sensors can be divided up in:       1. Characterization, tests and selection of detectors (MCPs and         secondary emitting surfaces).      2. Characterization and final calibration of the integrated sensor         units.      3. Functional tests of the sensors in the fully mounted (flight)         configuration.       The Electron Spectrometer unit, ELS, was calibrated at Mullard Space      Science Laboratory (MSSL), University College in London. The setup      for the calibration is identical to the one that was used for the      calibration of the Mars Express instrument. The calibration facility      provides a wide area photoelectron beam at energies ranging from a      few eV to 15 keV with variable beam intensities from a few Hz to      several MHz. Tests were carried out to study the following parameters      of the instrument: Analyser (Concentricity, K-factor, Angular      acceptance and Energy Resolution), Detector (Operational regime,      Rate response, Gain uniformity/QE) and UV response. First results      have shown significant differences in instrumental properties as a      function of the anode sector position due to a misalignment effect      in the fabrication process. Considering the mechanical imperfections      of the instrument, the laboratory calibrations were critical for      defining the instrument response.       Operation of ASPERA-4      =====================      The ASPERA-4 experiment contains four sensor units and the scanner.      Each sensor unit measures different components of the near-Venus      plasma and can be operated in different modes. The modes differ from      each other in the total amount of data produced and the structure of      TM packages although individual settings defining the sensor      configurations might be the same for different modes. The choice of      the instrument operational mode for each phase of the mission is due      to available power and telemetry as well as scientific requirements.       The scanning platform has three operational modes: scanning mode,      stepping mode, and fixed position mode. In the scanning mode, the      platform performs scans with three pre-selected speeds 32, 64, and      128 sec in one 0 deg - 180 deg scan. In the stepping mode the      platform moves in steps through the angle defined by a command. The      time the platform rests in each position is also commanded. In the      fixed position mode the platform moves to a commandable position from      0 deg to 180 deg and rests there until the scanner mode changes.       All four ASPERA-4 sensors, ELS, NPI, NPD1 and NPD2, IMA, can be run      independently although the individual sensor bit rates are set by a      macro command. The raw data are compressed by integration over time,      energy, azimuth, mass as well as using logarithmic compression of the      count values, RICE compression of final spectrum, masking, and      look-up tables (NPD).

urn:esa:psa:context:instrument:vex.mag,Magnetometer,Magnetometer,"   ABSTRACT   ========   The magnetometer instrument onboard the Venus Express orbiter   is described. This instrument consists of two tri-axial fluxgate   magnetometers. The nominal 500 earth days (2 Venus years) orbiting   Venus Express mission will lead to a detailed understanding of the   interaction between Venus' atmosphere and the solar wind. In   addition it will provide the magnetic field data for any combined   field, particle and  wave studies such as lightning and planetary   ion pickup processes, map with high time resolution the magnetic   properties in the magnetosheath, magnetic barrier, the ionosphere,   and the magnetotail and identify the plasma boundaries between the   various plasma regions.     INSTRUMENT DESCRIPTION   ======================   The VEX magnetometer MAG measures the 3D magnetic field in the   frequency bandwidth from DC to 128 Hz. It consists of two triaxial   fluxgate sensors (MAGOS and MAGIS). The dual sensor configuration   was chosen for a better monitoring of the stray magnetic fields   produced from other S/C units. The electronics box comprises two   sensor electronics boards, the DPU board and the DC/DC converter.   MAGOS will be mounted to the tip of a deployable boom whereas the   inboard sensor (MAGIS) will be directly attached to the +Z panel of   the spacecraft.    Well-known statistical methods, using time series of solar wind   measurements, are used to determine the offset field at the   magnetic field sensors (including instrument offset and S/C DC   field). Since major parts of the orbits around Venus are in the   solar wind, these data can be used for statistical offset   determination. If a too high offset (caused by DC field disturbance)   is detected, it is reduced by using the 12-bit compensation DACs.   The maximum possible compensation field is +/-10,000 nT along each   of the all together 6 sensor axes. A front to end health check is   possible by command which generates artificial fields using the   12-bit compensation DACs (Calibration Modes 2-4). Boom deployment   at the beginning of the cruise phase is essential for a proper MAG   in-flight calibration.

Afterwards, it remained ON during the commissioning of all the other instruments, to enable registration and characterisation of the magnetic disturbances generated during payload operation.

Higher data-rates are started only after start of the nominal mission in orbit around Venus (14 May 2006). During a typical science orbit, MAG is switched to 'Pericenter mode' one hour before pericenter, and then back to 'Solar wind mode' one hour after pericenter.

The magnetic field in Z-direction is   measured by a coil  surrounding both single sensors. The side length   of the cubic shaped sensor triad is approx. 5 cm. The sensor is   identical to the ones of Rosetta Lander and MIR instrument package   and similar to the ones flown on Equator-S (same soft-magnetic   ringcores made of an ultra-stable 6-81 Mo permalloy band: 2 mm   x 20 mum). The ringcores have been tested under extreme environmental   conditions aboard numerous space missions as well as in applied   geophysics. The excellent low noise and stability behaviour of the   sensor material has especially been proven aboard Equator-S.   Because of the wide operating temperature range of the fluxgate   sensor from -160 °C up to +120 °C, the sensor can be mounted outside   of the temperature controlled S/C only covered by a passive   multi-layer insulation blanket. No active heating or cooling is   needed for the sensors.    The sensor electronics generates an excitation AC current   (fundamental frequency of approx. 9.6 kHz), which drives the soft   magnetic core material deep into positive and negative saturation.   According to the fluxgate principle, the external magnetic field   distorts the symmetry of the magnetic flux and generates field   proportional even harmonics of the drive frequency in the sense   coils.    The induced voltage in the sense coil is digitised immediately after   the preamplifier at four times the excitation frequency. The   front end signal processing (synchronous detection and integration   and calculation of the feedback signals) is done by logic blocks   within an Actel FPGA (54SX32). A feedback field increases the   overall linearity and stability of the magnetometer. It is supplied   to all sensor elements via 12-bit DACs (feedback DACs) and a   separate pair of feedback coils per sensor axis. Sense and feedback   signals are continuously transmitted to the controller (128 Hz)   which calculates the magnetic field values (24 bits) by scaling and   adding up the received data (k1*ADC+k2*DAC). The appropriate dynamic   range is defined by selecting and transmitting of just 16 bit of the   calculated 24 bits mentioned above (also a kind of data compression)   Therefore, the range can be modified by T/C between +/- 32,8 nT and   +/- 8,388,6 nT with a corresponding digital resolution between 1 pT   and 128 pT. The default range/resolution will be +/- 262,1 nT/8 pT.   During the operational phase, an artificial magnetic field of   +/- 10,000 nT can independently be applied to each sensor via   additional 12-bit DACs for compensation of any disturbing DC stray   field. The digital magnetometer concept of MAG requires   analog-to-digital conversion at a higher data rate but it shows a   number of advantages over the more traditional analog fluxgate   magnetometer: Early digitisation makes the sensed signal robust to   changes of the environmental temperature and the supply voltages as   well as insensitive to EMC. Furthermore, no range  switching is   needed for getting the full range at full resolution, which reduces   design complexity and facilitates data analysis.     INSTRUMENT ELECTRONICS   ======================    The data processing unit (DPU) designated for the instrument controls   the two sensors and the spacecraft interface of the experiment and   performs internal data handling (sampling, data pre-processing,   compression, data frame generation). The DPU is based on an Intersil   HS-RTX2010RH rad-hard microcontroller, which was especially   developed for space systems embedded control.   The controlling logic for the DPU, the sensor interfaces, the address   decoder, the clock generator, the reset logic and the instrument   spacecraft interface (standard ESA OBDH interface) are implemented in   an Actel 1020RH FPGA. A watch-dog circuit, which is also implemented   in the FPGA, is supervising continuously the operation of the DPU and   can release a cold start in case of a system crash. The DPU integrates   128 kbytes of static RAM, 64 kbytes of program memory (PROM) and   64 kbytes of EEPROM. After power-on, the onboard software is copied   to RAM. After this the PROM is switched off and the instrument   software is executed in RAM. This procedure helps decreasing the   power consumption of the DPU. Software patches and various parameters   can be uploaded to the instrument and stored in the EEPROM.    The DC/DC Converter (MAGE-P) bears design heritage from the units   developed  by Imperial College for Cassini and Rosetta. For the Venus   Express MAG instrument, a single (non-redundant) converter is   provided. The +28V main and redundant primary power inputs are   therefore connected together after the on/off relays (see   Fig. 2.2 5 MAGE-P Block Diagram). The converter provides 4 secondary   supplies to the MAG instrument: +8 V (+8 V-D for excitation) and   +/-8 V (+/-8 V-A) to the analogue electronics, and a separate +5 V   (+5 V-D) digital supply. Over-current protection is implemented on   the primary input side; in the event of an over-current the supply   will automatically shut down. On the secondary side, the MAG   electronics is protected by an over-voltage circuit, which will shut   off the secondary side of the converter. The converter is stabilised   with respect to changes in the load and changes in the input Voltage,   and is capable of maintaining the secondary voltages within the tight   tolerances required by the MAG electronics.

urn:esa:psa:context:instrument:vex.rss,Radio Science Subsystem for VEX,RADIO SCIENCE SUBSYSTEM,"       Instrument Overview     ===================       Venus Express (VEX) Radio Science investigations utilized       instrumentation with elements on both the spacecraft and ground       (Earth).  Much of this was shared equipment, being used for routine       telecommunications as well as for Radio Science.  Ground systems were       provided by the European Space Agency (ESA) at New Norcia, Australia,       and Cebreros, Spain.  Ground support was also provided by the U.S.       National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Deep Space Network       (DSN) at sites in Australia, Spain, and the United States.  Because the       VEX orbit period was 24 hours and pericenter was synchronized with       viewing from Australia, all radio science activities were conducted       using the ESA facility at New Norcia and the DSN complex at Canberra.       Performance and calibration of both the spacecraft and ground systems       directly affected the radio science data accuracy and played a major       role in determining the quality of the results.         The spacecraft was able to receive and transmit signals at both S-band       (approximately 13 cm wavelength) and X-band (approximately 3.5 cm).       Two low-gain and two high-gain antennas were available; but not all       combinations of antenna and band could be selected.  The spacecraft       transmissions could use either an onboard oscillator for the frequency       reference ('one-way' mode) or a signal transmitted from the ground       ('two-way' mode).  In the former case, an ultra-stable oscillator (USO)       could be selected; in the latter case, either an S- or X-band signal       from the ground could be used as the reference, depending on the       antenna selected.         This description covers only the spacecraft and DSN components of the       instrument and only those portions of the VEX Radio Science       investigations supported by DSN data.  For more information see       [HAEUSLERETAL2006] and [MATTEIETAL2007].         Science Objectives     ==================       Two different types of radio science measurements were carried out with       Venus Express:           Radiometric Measurements:  Ground stations have the ability to         transmit coded and uncoded waveforms which can be echoed by distant         spacecraft.  Analysis of the received coding allows navigators to         determine the distance to the spacecraft; analysis of Doppler shift         on the carrier signal allows estimation of the line-of-sight         spacecraft velocity.  Range and Doppler measurements are used to         calculate the spacecraft trajectory and to infer gravity fields of         objects near the spacecraft.  NB: Doppler measurements can be made in         the one-way mode, but are usually more accurate if carried out in         the two-way mode.           Radio Propagation Measurements: Ground stations can record spacecraft         signals that have propagated through or been scattered from target         media.  Measurements of signal parameters after wave interactions         with surfaces, atmospheres, rings, and plasmas are used to infer         physical and electrical properties of the target.  Radio propagation         measurements can be conducted in either one-way or two-way mode.         These measurements were applied - separately and together - to Venus       science objectives such as inference of local gravity field anomalies,       atmospheric drag, temperature and pressure of the atmosphere, electron       density in the ionosphere, scattering properties of the surface, and       structure of the solar wind.           Gravity Measurements       --------------------         Measurement of the gravity field provides significant constraints on         inferences about the interior structure of Venus.  Precise, detailed         study of the spacecraft motion in Venus orbit can yield the mass         distribution of the planet.  Topographic data, such as those obtained         by the MAGELLAN radar altimeter, form a critical adjunct to these         measurements since only after the gravitational effects are adjusted         for topography can the gravity anomalies be interpreted geophysically.           Because of the thorough investigation of the Venus gravity field         by MAGELLAN [KONOPLIVETAL1999], Venus Express studies focused on the         characteristics of the field at 140-220 degrees east longitude and         40-80 degrees north latitude, where gaps in the MAGELLAN tracking         were most common.  The main area, known as Atalanta Plantia, is a low         altitude basin of diameter of about 1500 km and depth of about 2 km.         From its pericenter altitude of about 250 km, VEX was expected to         provide improvements to the field in this area; those, in turn, would         lead to better understanding of the lithosphere.           A possible by-product of the gravity field analysis is information         on the density structure of the upper atmosphere [TRACADISETAL2001].         The first campaign designed to detect and measure drag was conducted         during the summer of 2008.           Radio Occultation Measurements       ------------------------------         Atmospheric measurements by the method of radio occultation         contribute to an improved understanding of structure, circulation,         dynamics, and transport in the atmosphere.  These results are         based on detailed analysis of the radio signal phase as the ray path         enters and exits occultation by the planet, leading to profiles of         temperature and pressure in the neutral atmosphere and profiles of         electron density in the ionosphere.  Once the refractivity profile         of the neutral atmosphere has been determined, refractivity can be         used to estimate defocusing loss and the remaining loss in signal         intensity can be attributed  to absorption.  Venus radio occultation         data have previously been collected and analyzed from Pioneer Venus         Orbiter [KLIORE&PATEL1982] [NEWMANETAL1984] [JENKINS&STEFFES1991]         and MAGELLAN [JENKINSETAL1994] [HINSON&JENKINS1995].           Retrieval of atmospheric profiles requires coherent samples (samples         retaining both amplitude and frequency information) of the         radio signal that has propagated through the atmosphere, plus accurate         knowledge of the spacecraft trajectory.  The latter was obtained from         the VEX Flight Dynamics Team.  Solutions from VEX occultation data         provided neutral atmospheric structure from about 37 km altitude         (limited by critical refraction) to about 100 km and electron density         profiles from 100 to 400 km [PAETZOLDETAL2007B].           Spatial and temporal coverage in radio occultation experiments         are determined by the geometry of the spacecraft orbit and the dates         and times at which occultation data are acquired.  Since VEX radio         occultation experiments were conducted on a regular basis using a         polar orbit, there was extensive occultation coverage at high northern         and southern latitudes (e.g., beyond 60 degrees).  As the orbit         appeared to drift from edge-on to nearly broadside (as viewed from         Earth), occultation points moved toward the equator and the entry/exit         angle approached grazing.  During the first 1000 orbits/days of VEX         operations, there were six occultation 'seasons' of typically 60-70         orbits each interleaved with intervals of approximately the same         duration when there were no occultations.           Bistatic Surface Scattering Measurements       ------------------------------------------         One of the spacecraft's high-gain antennas (HGA1 or HGA2) could also         be pointed toward the surface of the planet.  The strength of the         signal scattered from the illuminated area could be measured and the         results interpreted in terms of the dielectric constant of the         surface material.  The model for interpretation assumes Fresnel         reflection at the specular angle.  The cross-spectrum between the         right- and left-circularly polarized echo channels (RCP and LCP,         respectively) contains information about the argument of the         dielectric constant -- that is, whether it is insulating or         conducting.  A conducting material was inferred from MAGELLAN         bistatic radar observations using linear polarization near         Cleopatra Patera in Maxwell Montes [PETTENGILLETAL1996].  One goal         of the VEX bistatic radar experiments was to confirm the MAGELLAN         results using circular polarization and to investigate whether         similar signatures could be found at other high-altitude targets.           Under certain circumstances, dispersion of the echo (its spectral         broadening) may be interpreted in terms of the rms surface roughness         on scales comparable to the wavelength.           Solar Scintillation and Faraday Rotation Experiments       ----------------------------------------------------         Solar scintillation observations were conducted to improve         understanding of the structure and dynamics of the solar         corona and wind.  Because Venus orbits the Sun, spacecraft like VEX         are transported behind the solar disk, as seen from Earth.  Radio         waves propagating between VEX and Earth are refracted and scattered         by the solar plasma [WOO1993].  Intensity fluctuations         can be related to fluctuations in electron density along the path,         while Doppler or phase scintillations can be related to both electron         density fluctuations and also the speed of the solar wind.  Many         plasma effects decrease as the square of the radio frequency;         scintillations are about an order of magnitude stronger at S-band         than X-band.  The first solar conjunction observations with VEX were         conducted during late 2006.

It,       like the spacecraft itself, was modeled on the radio system used on       Mars Express. Many details of the subsystem are unknown; but they are       not important for understanding the science.  The spacecraft 'build       date' is taken to be 2005-11-01, shortly before launch.

The primary high-gain antenna (HGA1) was a body-fixed 1.30 m diameter         parabolic dish which allowed transmission and reception at both S- and         X-band.  The HGA1 boresight was in the +X direction of the spacecraft         coordinate system, offset 5 degrees in the +Z direction.  Its gain was         25.7 dBi and 37 dBi at S- and X-band, respectively.           The auxilliary high-gain antenna (HGA2) was mounted oppositely to HGA1         so that it could be used for communication with Earth when Venus was         between the quadrature points of its orbit and HGA1 was being used as         a Sun shield.  HGA2 could only be used for communication at X-Band;         its diameter was 0.2 m and its X-band gain was 25 dB.           Two low-gain antennas (LGA1 and LGA2) were mounted on the top and         bottom panels of the spacecraft; they operated only at S-band.  The         boresight for LGA1 was nominally in the +Z direction; the boresight         of LGA2 was offset from the -Z spacecraft axis by 17.5 degrees in         the +X direction.  Both LGAs had very broad antenna patterns.           HGA1 was the primary antenna for receiving telecommands from and         transmitting telemetry signals to the ground when VEX was on the far         side of the Sun.  In that geometry HGA1 also provided thermal         protection to the spacecraft.  When Venus was between its quadrature         points -- on the near side of the Sun -- HGA2 was the prime antenna         and HGA1 served solely as a sun shield. The LGAs were used during the         commissioning phase after launch and for emergency operations.           The Radio Frequency Distribution Unit (RFDU) switched S-Band signals         and the Waveguide Interface Unit (WIU) switched X-Band signals on the         spacecraft.           Switchable Traveling Wave Tube Amplifiers (TWTA1 and TWTA2) provided         65 watts of X-band transmitter power to the RFDU; their inputs could         come from either Transponder 1 or Transponder 2.  The S-band         transmitter power was 5 watts, which was generated within the         transponder units.           The S-band uplink was received via LGA1, LGA2, or HGA1.  In the         coherent two-way mode the received frequency was used to derive the         downlink frequencies by using the constant transponder ratios         880/221 and 240/221 for X-band and S-band downlink, respectively.           The X-band uplink was received via either HGA.  In the coherent         two-way mode the received frequency was used to derive the downlink         frequencies by using the constant transponder ratios 880/749 and         240/749 for X-band and S-band downlink, respectively.  An X-band         uplink generally enhanced the performance of the radio link         because X-band is less sensitive to the interplanetary plasma         along the propagation path.           The X-band and S-band frequencies were related by a factor of 11/3.         If an uplink existed and the 'one-way' mode had not been selected,         the downlinks were coherent with the uplink by their respective         transponding ratios.  The dual-frequency downlink allowed separation         of the classical Doppler shift, due to relative motion of the         spacecraft and the ground station, from the dispersive media effects,         due to the propagation of the radio waves through the ionosphere and         interplanetary medium.           In one-way mode, the downlink transponder 1 frequency was derived         from a Temperature Controlled Crystal Oscillator (TCXO) and the         transponder 2 frequency was derived from an onboard ultrastable         oscillator (USO).  The one-way mode could be selected by command         from the ground.  If the spacecraft receiver could not detect an         uplink signal from the ground, the TCXO or USO was selected by         default.           TCXO stability was several orders of magnitude less than the         uplink reference; the USO stability was 1 part in 10^13 over time         scales of 10-100 seconds; this was an order of magnitude less         stable than frequency references on the gorund.  However, for         long-duration, deep radio occultations, the USO was preferred         because perturbations on the downlink signals could be attributed         unambiguously to a single passage through the atmosphere.         Although either USO or TCXO could have served for bistatic radar,         the USO was preferred for its better performance.  For other         observations, the two-way coherent mode was preferred because of         the higher stability provided by the ground frequency reference.           The redundant transponders each consisted of an S-band and X-band         receiver and transmitter.  The spacecraft was capable of receiving         one uplink signal at S-band (2100 MHz) via the LGAs, at either         X-band (7100 MHz) or S-band via HGA1, or at X-band only via HGA2.         The spacecraft could transmit a downlink signal at S-band (2300 MHz)         and (simultaneously) a downlink signal at X-band (8400 MHz) using         HGA1; or it could transmit one downlink signal at S-band via the         LGAs or one X-band signal using HGA2.           Operational Considerations       --------------------------         Radio science observations often required operation of the spacecraft         in orientations and configurations that were not compatible with         spacecraft constraints, telecommunications, and requirements for         other instruments.  There were also limitations within the Radio         Science Team, which resulted in a prioritization of radio science         observations.  The following list is representative but not complete.             Thermal constraints were severe.  Spacecraft cooling panels could           not be exposed to direct sunlight nor could other panels hosting           payload components be exposed for more than a few minutes.  The           -X spacecraft axis could never be closer than 90 degrees to the           Sun direction, The minimum incidence angle on the +Z panel was 10           degrees to protect optical instruments.  The +Y and -Y panels           could be exposed to the Sun at incidence angles 80-90 degrees,           but for no longer than one hour.             Bistatic radar experiments could be conducted with HGA1 only if           that antenna's boresight was within 90 degrees of the Sun direction.           When Venus was between inferior conjunction and quadrature, all           radio tracking and occultations were conducted using HGA2 (at           X-Band only).             Gravity observations were most interesting when two-way           dual-frequency data could be collected as the spacecraft passed           through pericenter.  But pericenter time was highly contested           with several other instruments, which also sought those           opportunities to acquire data with the highest resolution.             Bistatic radar probing of anomalously reflecting, high altitude           regions was most revealing when conducted near the Brewster angle.           For dielectric constants of 3 (typical of sand), the Brewster           angle is 60 degrees, measured from the local vertical.  For a           dielectric constant of 10, the Brewster angle is 72 degrees.           MAGELLAN bistatic radar had suggested dielectric constants with           magnitudes as large as 100 in Maxwell Montes.  X-Band signal           absorption in the neutral atmosphere made detection of surface           echoes at incidence angles larger than 70 degrees nearly           impossible; so experiments seeking information about the high           altitude anomalies were preferentially scheduled for S-Band at           incidence angle larger than 60 degrees.             In the latter half of 2006, perhaps as early as 4 August and           definitely by November, the performance of the on-board S-Band           radio system deteriorated.  Tests showed that both the transmitted           power from the spacecraft and signals reaching the on-board           receiver were reduced by approximately 15 dB.  A switch between           the transponders and HGA1 was suspected, but neither a specific           fault nor a correction was identified.  Bistatic radar experiments,           which depended on S-Band for surface echo detection, were           suspended.  In other investigations, S-Band was de-emphasized           since the noise accompanying the weak S-Band signal sometimes           degraded the results compared with analysis of X-Band data alone.             Calibration       -----------         For many experiments, calibration data were collected in conjunction         with the scientific observations.  For example, carrier power and         frequency could be determined before and/or after bistatic radar and         radio occultation experiments when the antenna was pointed toward         Earth.           The beamwidth and pointing accuracy of HGA1 were calibrated during         post-launch tests [ACCOMAZZO2006].  The half-power points were about         3.3 and 0.86 degrees from the boresight at S- and X-band, respectively         (compared with 3.5 and 0.96 degrees predicted).  The boresight itself         was -0.32 deg toward the spacecraft +Y axis and 0.02 degrees toward         the +Z axis at S-Band, compared with prediction; and it was -0.14         degrees toward +Y and +0.04 degrees toward +Z at X-Band compared         with prediction.           For radio tracking data, error sources in two-way mode were estimated         at 1.7 AU Earth-Venus distance using the New Norcia ground station,         a 1 Hz tracking loop bandwidth, and 10 seconds integration were         estimated to yield a thermal contribution to the Doppler velocity of         0.004 mm/s [HAEUSLERETAL2005].           Platform Mounting       -----------------         The high gain antenna HGA1 was rigidly attached to the +X wall of the         spacecraft bus.  Therefore, the VEX HGA frame (VEX_HGA) was defined         as a fixed offset frame with its orientation given relative to the         VEX_SPACECRAFT frame:             +Z axis of the HGA frame was in the antenna boresight direction              (nominally -5 degrees off the spacecraft +X axis toward the              spacecraft +Z axis);           +Y axis of the HGA frame was in the direction of the spacecraft              +Y axis;           +X completed the right hand frame;             The origin of the HGA frame was located at the geometric center of           the HGA dish outer rim circle.                                         ^+Zhga                                       |                                       |                                       |                                 +Xhga |       +Yhga                                  _____o------->                                  \         /         .________________.     .__`._____.'__.     .________________.         |                 \    |             |    /                 |         |                  \   |     ___     |   /                  |         |                   |  |   .'   `  +Ysc |                   |         |                   |o=|   |  x------->o|                   |         |                   |  |    `_|+Zsc  |  |                   |         |                  /   |      |      |   \                  |         ._________________/    .______|______.    \_________________.          -Y Solar Array               |               +Y Solar Array                                       V -Xsc           Nominally a single rotation of -85 degrees about the +Y axis was         needed to align the spacecraft frame with the HGA frame.           The auxilliary high-gain antenna HGA2 was rigidly mounted to the         +Z side of the spacecraft bus.  Its pointing direction was symmetric         to HGA1 with respect to the +Z axis of the spacecraft frame.  The         HGA2 frame was defined relative to the VEX_SPACECRAFT frame:             +Z axis of the HGA2 frame was in the antenna boresight direction,              +5 degrees off the spacecraft -X axis toward the spacecraft              +Z axis.           +Y axis was in the direction of the spacecraft +Y axis           +X axis completes the right hand frame.             The origin of the frame was located at the geometric center of           the HGA2 dish outer rim circle.           Operating Modes       ---------------         A two-way dual-frequency radio link was used for atmospheric drag         campaigns, gravity observations, and solar corona investigations.         Such a radio link benefited from the superior frequency stability         of the ground station.           A one-way dual-frequency radio link was used for radio occultation         experiments because the uplink was a poor frequency reference during         deep occultations.           In the experiments above the dual-frequency downlink at X-band and         S-band was used to separate classical and dispersive Doppler shifts,         allowing correction of the observed frequency shift by any plasma         contribution.  Note, however, that the S-Band link was compromised         starting in late 2006; it was ineffective for estimating plasma         effects and was discontinued for some observations (see Operational         Considerations, above).           A one-way dual-frequency radio link at S- and X-band was used for         bistatic radar experiments.  In these experiments, HGA1 was pointed         toward Venus and could not be used to capture an uplink signal,         receive commands, or transmit telemetry.  After the S-Band link was         compromised in August 2006, bistatic radar experiments were         suspended (see Operational Considerations, above).           In the above experiments, operation was preferred with full power         in the carrier (no telemetry or other modulation on the downlink)         to maximize signal-to-noise ratio.         Instrument Specification - DSN     ==============================       Three Deep Space Communications Complexes (DSCCs) (near Barstow, CA;       Canberra, Australia; and Madrid, Spain) comprised the DSN tracking       network.  Each complex was equipped with several antennas [including       at least one each 70-m, 34-m High Efficiency (HEF), and 34-m Beam       WaveGuide (BWG)], associated electronics, and operational systems.       Primary activity at each complex was radiation of commands to and       reception of telemetry from active spacecraft.         Transmission and reception was possible in several radio-frequency       bands, the most common being S-band (nominally a frequency of       2100-2300 MHz or a wavelength of 14.2-13.0 cm) and X-band (7100-8500       MHz or 4.2-3.5 cm).  Transmitter output powers of up to 400 kW were       available.         The Deep Space Network was managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of       the California Institute of Technology for the U.S. National Aeronautics       and Space Administration.

Subsystems - DSN     ----------------       The Deep Space Communications Complexes (DSCCs) were an integral       part of Radio Science instrumentation.  Their system performance       directly determined the degree of success of Radio Science       investigations, and their system calibration determined the degree       of accuracy in the results of the experiments.  The following       paragraphs describe the functions performed by the individual       subsystems of a DSCC.  This material has been adapted from       [ASMAR&HERRERA1993] and [DSN871-049-041]; for additional information,       consult [DSN810-5], [DSN821-110], and [DSN821-104].

On the dayside, it measures the 0.90 um solar radiation scattered by the clouds,             and quantifies the horizontal wind vectors by using the cloud-tracking technique.             On the nightside, it has three channels of 0.90, 0.97, and 1.01 um to detect             thermal emission mostly from the surface and a little from the lowermost atmosphere.

urn:jaxa:darts:context:instrument:vco.lac,Lightning and Airglow Camera,Lightning and Airglow Camera,"             Lightning and Airglow Camera (LAC) searches for lightning flashes and maps airglow             emissions on the nightside disk of Venus when Akatsuki is located in the eclipse (umbra)             of Venus. A major goal of the lightning observation is to settle the controversy             on the occurrence of lightning in the Venusian atmosphere. The distribution of lightning,             if it exists, should reflect the microphysics of clouds and the dynamics of mesoscale             convection. The 777.4 nm [OI] line of atomic oxygen is utilized for lightning observation,             as this line is considered the strongest emission from lightning discharges according to             a laboratory experiment simulating the Venusian atmosphere. Possible lightning flashes             were detected on the nightside disk of Venus at this wavelength by using a ground-based             telescope.              LAC also measures emissions in two airglow bands to study the global-scale circulation             and small-scale waves in the lower thermosphere. One is the O2 Herzberg II emission             centered at 552.5 nm wavelength, which is considered a consequence of the recombination             of atomic oxygen in downwelling and is the strongest emission among the visible Venusian             airglows. The other is the 557.7 nm [OI] emission; though Venera 9 and 10 failed to             detect this emission it was observed using a ground-based telescope.

The spacecraft element (covered by this context product) was             further distributed among several subsystems on the spacecraft, while the ground element             included ground stations at Usuda Deep Space Center of JAXA, Indian Deep Space Network             (IDSN) of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), and Weilheim station (WHM) of the             German Aerospace Center (DLR).              The radio communication system of the spacecraft works with X-band downlink frequency only.             During the experiments, one of the X-band transponders is locked to an Ultra-Stable             Oscillator (USO), and the transponder signal is amplified by a traveling wave tube amplifier.             The USO provides the stable reference frequency for the transponder.              Downlink signals are amplified and radiated through a slot array antenna toward the tracking             stations on Earth. The radio waves sequentially go behind the planet's ionosphere and             neutral atmosphere as seen from the tracking stations, and reemerges in the reverse sequence.             During such occultation events the neutral and ionized atmospheres of the planet cause             bending, attenuation and scintillation of radio waves. The perturbed signal is collected by             ground stations, amplified, down-converted, and recorded for later analysis. From the             changes in bending angle and attenuation, atmospheric profiles of density, temperature and             H2SO4 amount in the neutral atmosphere as well as electron density in the ionosphere of the             planet can be derived.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:apxs.msl,ALPHA PARTICLE X-RAY SPECTROMETER for MSL,ALPHA PARTICLE X-RAY SPECTROMETER,"The APXS (Alpha-Particle X-ray Spectrometer) for MSL is an improved version of the APXS that flew successfully on Pathfinder and the Mars Exploration Rovers Spirit and Opportunity. The MSL APXS takes advantage of a combination of the terrestrial standard methods Particle-Induced X-ray Emission (PIXE) and X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) to determine elemental chemistry. It uses curium-244 sources for X-ray spectroscopy to determine the abundance of major elements down to trace elements from sodium to bromine and beyond. The instrument consists of a main electronics unit in the rover's body and a sensor head mounted on the robotic arm. Measurements are taken by deploying the sensor head towards a desired sample, placing the sensor head in contact or hovering typically less than 2 cm away, and measuring the emitted X-ray spectrum for 15 minutes to 3 hours without the need of further interaction by the rover. At the end of the measurement, the rover retrieves the science data of 32 kilobytes, containing up to 13 consecutively taken spectra and engineering data. The internal APXS software splits the total measurement into equal time slots with an adjustable cycle time parameter. This allows us to check for repeatability and to select spectra with sufficient spectral quality. The MSL APXS can activate an internal Peltier cooler for the X-ray detector chip. This results in a sufficient spectral resolution (FWHM) of below 200 eV at 6.4 keV below ~ -5 deg C and best FWHM of <150 eV below ~ -15 deg C environmental temperature. Compared to the APXS on MER, where the best FWHM was reached at temperatures below ~ -45 deg C, this allows a significantly larger operational time window for APXS analysis. The MSL APXS has approximately 3 times the sensitivity for low Z (atomic number) elements and approximately 6 times for higher Z elements than the MER APXS. A full analysis with detection limits of 100 ppm for Ni and ~ 20 ppm for Br now requires 3 hours, while quick look analysis for major and minor elements at ~ 0.5% abundance, such as Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Fe, or S, can be done in 10 minutes or less. On MER, the elements detected by the APXS in rock and soil samples are typically Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Zn, and Br. Elevated levels of Ge, Ga, Pb, and Rb were found in some of the MER samples. The sampled area is about 1.7 cm in diameter when the instrument is in contact with the sample. A standoff results in gradually lower intensity and an increased diameter of the measured spot.  Low Z element X-rays stem from the topmost 5 microns of the sample, higher Z elements like Fe are detected from the upper ~50 microns. Sample preparation is not needed; the APXS results average the composition over the sampled area and the oxide abundances measured are renormalized to 100%. However, on MSL, a dust removal tool (brush) is available to remove loose material from a rock surface before making an APXS measurement.  The major improvements and changes compared to the MER APXS are (1) improved sensitivity by a factor 3 giving full analysis within ~3 hours; (2) additional improved sensitivity for high Z elements by increased X-ray source strength; (3) operable during Martian day by using Peltier cooler for the X-ray detector; (4) basaltic calibration target mounted on the rover (on the robotic arm azimuth actuator housing), dedicated for the APXS; (5) no alpha channel (no Rutherford Backscattering spectroscopy); (6) compressed short duration X-ray spectra ( ~10 seconds ) can be used to steer the arm movement in a 'proximity mode'.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:ase.phx,ATMOSPHERIC STRUCTURE EXPERIMENT for PHX,ATMOSPHERIC STRUCTURE EXPERIMENT,"The PHX entry capsule contained two Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) mounted on the underside of the lander on opposite sides of the spacecraft. Only one IMU was used during descent, entry and landing (EDL). The other IMU was a backup device that was not turned on. The Phoenix IMU is quasi-standard commercial product, sometimes called a Miniature IMU, or MIMU [GARAVELLIETAL1995]. This particular device was manufactured by Honeywell (Clearwater, FL) with model number YG9666BC. The IMU used three Allied Signal QFLEX accelerometers for linear acceleration measurement and three Honeywell GG1320 RLG ring-laser gyros for angular rotation measurement. However, the IMU was configured internally so that the linear accelerations were integrated and output as linear velocity changes while the gyro measurements were output as angle changes in a given sample time. No input from scientists was possible concerning the device selection and location within the lander, which was done by spacecraft engineers for the cancelled NASA Mars 2001 Lander prior to the initiation of the Phoenix project. The Phoenix lander was based on the Mars 2001 Lander design. Consequently, the IMU used during EDL of the Phoenix spacecraft was neither located at the entry vehicle center of mass nor the spin axis, which otherwise would have been desirable to optimize noise minimization for scientific purposes. At a rate of 200 Hz, the IMU output the accumulated linear velocity change (the time integral of acceleration) in three Cartesian axes and accumulated angle change (the time integral of angular rate) about three Cartesian axes. Data was saved onboard PHX at the device output rate of 200 Hz and was not down-sampled. The IMU had a mass of 3.52 kg and approximately 4051 cc volume.  Each accelerometer within the IMU had a full-scale range of 36.8g (where g represents Earth's standard surface gravitational acceleration of 9.80665 meters per second per second). The accelerometer and gyro signals were electronically integrated inside the IMU to produce an output of accumulated delta-v (linear velocity change) and delta-q (angular velocity change) at 200 Hz.  The accelerometers had two stages of digitization that resulted in pulses and then counts. The final raw digital output from the IMU accelerometers was in counts, in velocity units, where 1 output count = 0.0753 mm/sec.  But the final output moved up and down in pulses, which are leaps of many counts, with each pulse equivalent to 2.7 mm/sec. Thus, the amplitude of one pulse was equivalent to 2.7/0.0753 = 35.86 counts, on average. Added to this was noise in the system, which was on the order of 1 count, so that jumps in the raw output were typically 36 or 37 counts. This determined the digital resolution of the raw 200 Hz data to be a delta-v of 2.7 mm/sec and typical noise level of 0.0753 mm/sec. Individual gyros measure the angular rotation about one axis. Each raw IMU gyro output is a 16 bit signed integer (i.e., from -32767 to +32767) with the least significant bit (LSB) equivalent to 1 micro-radian. Because the data was generated at 200 Hz or every 5 millisecs, a full-scale value of 32768 would correspond to 375 deg/sec. (32,768 * 1 microradian /0.005 sec = 0.032768/0.005 radian/sec = 6.5536 rad/sec = 375 deg/sec). The smallest motion in a 200 Hz interval is one count, which corresponds to 0.01144 deg/sec (1 * 1 microradian /0.005 sec = 200 micro-rad/sec = 0.01144 deg/sec). Smaller angular motions can be measured over longer time periods by integration of the raw data. Noise on the raw gyro output is estimated as 45 micro-radians (3 sigma).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The final image is formed by four strips from which the I, Q, and U parameters can be extracted.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:caps.co,CASSINI PLASMA SPECTROMETER for CO,CASSINI PLASMA SPECTROMETER,"     The content from this description has been adapted from the CAPS   instrument description paper [YOUNGETAL2004].       Instrument Overview   ===================       The CAPS instrument was comprised of three sensors: the Electron     Spectrometer (ELS), the Ion Beam Spectrometer (IBS), and the Ion     Mass Spectrometer (IMS). The ELS sensor measured the velocity     distribution of electrons from 0.7 eV to 30 keV, a range that     permited coverage of thermal electrons found at Titan and near the     ring plane as well as more energetic trapped electrons and auroral     particles. The IBS sensor measured ion velocity distributions with     very high angular and energy resolution from 1 eV to 50 keV. It was     specially designed to measure sharply defined ion beams expected in     the solar wind at 9.5 AU, highly directional rammed ion fluxes     encountered in Titan's ionosphere, and anticipated field-aligned     auroral fluxes. The IMS sensor was designed to measure the     composition of hot, diffuse magnetospheric plasmas and     low-concentration ion species with an atomic resolution     M/delta M ~70 and, for certain molecules, (such as N2+ and CO+),     effective resolution as high as ~2500. The three sensors were     mounted on a motor-driven actuator that rotates the entire     instrument over approximately one-half of the sky every 3 minutes.       Scientific Objectives   =====================       The Cassini Plasma Spectrometer (CAPS) had many complimentary     science objectives during the Cassini mission.  The CAPS objectives     were as follows:         - Perform in-situ studies of dust-plasma interactions in Saturn's         magnetosphere       - Study Saturnian auroral phenomena       - Observe Saturn Kilometric radiation (SKR) generation       - Study magnetospheric external and internal boundaries,         structures and plasma domains (including flux tubes)       - Study microphysics of the bow shock, magnetosheath, magnetopause         and magnetotail       - Study magnetospheric dynamics (driven by solar wind, internal         rotation, substorms, radial transport, and mass loading)       - Study the composition of the ionosphere, exposphere and         atmosphere at Titan       - Study the interaction of Titan's upper atmosphere and ionosphere         with Saturn's magnetosphere (precipitation, ion pickup)       - Study the structure of upstream, bow shock, wake, and flux tube         regions around Titan       - Determine composition of ionized molecules originating from the         ionosphere and the icy satellite's expospheres       - Study the composition of the exposphere and surfaces around icy         satellite       - Look at the interaction of the magnetosphere (precipitation, ion         pickup) with icy satellite exosphere       - Study the structure of upstream, bow shock, wake, and flux tube         regions around the icy satellites       - Study the composition of ring exposphere and ring particle         surfaces, characterize ring/magnetoshere interactions,         dust-plasma interactions, ring particle dynamics and erosion,         and study the interactions of ring plasma with Saturn's         ionosphere         Operational Considerations   ==========================       The ELS measured differential electron velocity distributions at     densities as low as 10**(-3) cm**(-3). The measurement range     extended from 1 eV to 28 keV. The lower end of this range, allowed     detailed studies of secondary electron fluxes that contribute to     ionization and chemical processes taking place at Titan and     elsewhere. At tens of keV ELS contributed to studies of trapped     electrons and those associated with saturnian aurora. Throughout its     energy range ELS provided a global survey of plasma density,     temperature and electron pitch angle distributions that were needed     to derive a comprehensive view of plasma dynamics within the     magnetosphere and, for roughly 50% of the mission, in the solar wind     and magnetosheath.       The large amount of time that Cassini spent in the solar wind during     the Cassini tour presented the opportunity to study both the solar     wind's intrinsic characteristics and its interactions with the     magnetosphere of Saturn, and the comet-like magnetosphere of Titan.     The IBS energy and angular resolution (few percent and ~2 degrees     respectively) provided the capability of making solar wind     measurements, and for observing ion ram fluxes at Titan and auroral     ion beams. The IBS energy range extends from 1 eV up to 50 keV.       The IMS was designed to provide comprehensive measurements in all     regions of the magnetosphere. IMS relies on time-focused optics     combined with carbon foil technology. It was designed to separate     atomic species with high resolution, and to identify isobaric     molecular species such as CH4+, NH2+, and O+ (all with M/Q = 16,     where M/Q is the mass/charge ratio) or N2+ and CO+ (M/Q = 28) that     would otherwise have required a very large conventional instrument     to achieve. Because of its 1 eV to 50 keV energy range IMS was also     used to study the composition of Titan's ionosphere at a few eV,     complementing INMS [WAITEETAL2004], and to study energetic trapped     ions, complementing the MIMI/CHEMS investigation [KRIMIGISETAL2004].       Detectors   =========       ELS     ---         The ELS sensor was a hemispherical top-hat electrostatic analyzer       (ESA) similar to that described by [CARLSONETAL1983].  The       detector consisted of a chevron microchannel plate (MCP) pair with       a gold-coated copper spacer 66 microns thick positioned between       the two plates.  At operating voltage, the measured full width       half max (FWHM) pulse height distribution was 130%. The       resistivity of the glass in the MCP was low enough to allow the       plate to respond to count-rates up to 1 x 104 mm**(-2) s**(-1) or       approximately 106 electrons per anode per second, without       saturation causing significant gain degradation. The MCP high       voltage could be varied from 0 to 3.5 kV in steps of approximately       60V. This allowed the MCP bias to be increased throughout the       mission to recover possible gain loss.  The bias voltage at the       input to the MCP was maintained at +150 V to ensure all electrons       have sufficient energy to be detected.  During calibration, the       operational voltage on the MCP was approximately +2.4 kV.         Electrons leaving the rear of the MCP traversed a gap of 500       microns before striking the anode.  A voltage of +82 V applied       between the anode surface and the back surface of the MCP       optimized spreading of the charge cloud leaving the MCP. The anode       had eight discrete 20 degree-wide electrodes separated by 150       microns. The active anode area was formed by 10 micron thick gold       on a Deranox 975 Alumina substrate. The area of the separator       contacting the MCP was coated with 10 microns of gold. A signal       ground plane incorporated into the bottom layer of the multilayer       ceramic provided electromagnetic screening of the anode from the       analyzer structure.         IBS     ---         The IBS sensor was similar to ELS, as it was also based on the       principles of a curved-electrode electrostatic analyzer.  The       primary difference, aside from its larger radius, was that the       spherical IBS electrodes extend 178 degrees from the entrance       aperture to channel-electron multiplier detectors located at the       exit.         A unique aspect of IBS was the method used to obtain high       angular resolution 3-D velocity space measurements. Based on the       crossed-fan field-of-view concept employed in an earlier solar       wind ion instrument [BAMEETAL1978], it was possible to obtain the       required angular resolution by tilting the acceptance fans of each       aperture 30 degrees relative to the others.  With that in mind,       there were three curved 2.5 x 15 mm apertures in the IBS faceplate,       each with a nominal acceptance fan of +/- 1.5 degrees FWFM in       azimuth (set by the ESA characteristics) and +/- 75 degrees FWFM       in elevation angle (set by the apertures) from the normal to the       plane of the aperture.  If we define the middle aperture as being       along the 0 degree radius from the center of the instrument       faceplate, the other two apertures were located at +/- 30 degrees       relative to it. There were three CEM detectors located 180 degrees       around the faceplate from each of the apertures, i.e. in the       position where ions entering the apertures from any transmitted       direction come to a focus. The FOV of the middle aperture was       oriented such that its long (polar) dimension was parallel to the       azimuthal (Z) axis of the CAPS actuator. The FOV of the other two       apertures were therefore 'crossed' with inclinations of +/- 30       degrees with respect to that of the middle aperture.         The three matched detectors used in IBS were custom-built CEMs       chosen for their rugged construction out of solid ceramic, their       high gain characteristics (typical plateau ~10^8), and their       availability in nearly any desired form factor (the manufacturer       was Dr. Sjuts Optotechnik GmBH of Germany). The input funnel       interior dimensions are 5 x 20 mm, which was more than adequate to       intercept all of the ions converging at each of the sensor's three       focal points. Ninety percent transmission grids were stood off       from the front of the CEM funnels and biased negatively with       respect to the funnels in order to minimize secondary electron       loss.  The input assembly (grid and funnel) was biased at negative       high voltage so that all transmitted ions received       post-acceleration equivalent to the CEM bias. A CEM responded to       an incoming ion by emitting an electron charge pulse at its exit,       which was biased at about -100 V.         IMS     ---         The IMS sensor approach was to choose a novel technique based on       isochronous (time-focusing) mass spectrometry based on carbon       foils.  In order to achieve IMS measurement goals the properties       of a toroidal ESA were matched to those of the TOF analyzer. The       combination of an ESA with carbon-foil based TOF measurements       had been previously developed and flown in space by Gloeckler and       colleagues [GLOECKLER&HSIEH1976, GLOECKLERETAL1995,       GLOECKLERETAL1998, HAMILTONETAL1990] and Young [YOUNGETAL1992,       YOUNGETAL1998B]. Early development of the LEF concept       [GLOECKLERETAL1995], resulted in a high-resolution 1-D (in energy)       isochronous instrument used to measure the collimated flow of the       solar wind. However, [MCCOMASETAL1990] and [MCCOMAS&NORDHOLT1990]       were the first to describe the principles and operation of a       cylindrically symmetric LEF analyzer capable of making 2-D       energy-angle measurements. [MCCOMASETAL1998] and       [NORDHOLTETAL1998] further describe the LEF application to IMS.         Ions initially enter the top-hat portion of the ESA through a       grounded collimator (the top-hat was similar to the geometry used       in the ELS). A flat circular plate truncates the inner ESA toroid       at the point where it joins the top-hat section. There are two       advantages to toroidal geometry: (1) Toroids have two radii of       curvature that independently control ion focusing within the TOF       section (in spheres the two radii are degenerate and equal, in       cylinders one radius is infinite). (2) The top-hat entrance       aperture of a toroid like the one used in IMS was larger per unit       of ESA plate surface area than for a comparably sized spherical       top-hat, giving higher sensitivity per unit of sensor weight       [WOLLNIK1971, YOUNGETAL1988]. In the elevation plane, ions are       formed into a beam by a combination of vanes in the entrance       collimator and field-correcting slits (one per 20 degree pixel) at       the exit of the ESA.         A voltage applied to the inner ESA electrode created an electric       field in the top-hat that deflects ions into the toroid. As with       ELS and IBS, only particles within a particular range of E/Q and       direction of arrival were transmitted through the ESA to the TOF       analyzer. Ions that successfully exited the ESA were accelerated       by +/- 14.56 kV into one of eight ultra-thin (~100 angstrom)       carbon foils distributed around the entrance to the TOF analyzer       (one foil per angular 'pixel').  Ions falling through the       accelerating field, gained sufficient velocity perpendicular to       the foil so that they would penetrate the foils even at the lowest       energies (~ 1eV). Higher post-acceleration voltages would       naturally have been desirable, but would have driven up instrument       size, mass, and power in addition to risk.       Electronics   ===========       ELS sensor electronics     ----------------------         The electronics were accommodated on four circuit boards       integrated to a single motherboard consisting of flexible and       rigid sections.  This design eliminated the need for an internal       cable harness, and at the same time coupled ELS to the CAPS/DPU       interface connector.         MCP pulses collected on eight anodes were passed to an equal       number of Amptek(R) A111F charge amplifier/discriminators that       converted raw signals above a predetermined threshold into 5 V,       300 ns logic pulses. Thresholds were set in hardware to 3.4 x 105       electrons, which yielded an equivalent level of 25 mV (into 2.3       pF), giving good rejection of electronic noise. A decrease in the       threshold level by 2.5 mV increased spurious electronic noise       counts by a factor of ten. (This relationship held over a wide       range of thresholds.  MCP dark counts and penetrating radiation       were the main remaining contributors to background.).         Front and rear MCP bias voltages were provided by Zener diodes,       which required filtering at these low currents (around 10       microAmperes). The MCP anodes were biased at high voltage so       signal pulses had to be decoupled by high voltage capacitors       before the signal goes to the amplifiers which shared the same       circuit board with the HV bias/anode coupling circuitry. The HV       section was carefully designed and laid out to support a maximum       field of 800 V/mm.         The SMU (sensor management unit) received and interpreted sensor       commands sent by the CAPS DPU and accumulated and transmited ELS       data back to the DPU. It stored the sequence of high voltage steps       to be applied to the analyzer, the grid voltage setting, and the       MCP voltage table. SMU circuitry supplied stimulation test pulses       of variable amplitude and frequency to the amplifier/discriminator       channels. Under control of the CAPS DPU, the SMU clock speed could       be successively halved to lengthen the data acquisition period       from 31.25 to 1000 ms/step, creating progressively longer energy       sweeps. Furthermore, the sample deadtime could be varied between       25% and 12.5% of the sample period to increase counting rate       capability at high rates.         IBS sensor electronics     ----------------------         For IBS, all of the electronics were mounted on two circular       circuit boards housed in the ESA hemispherical cavity.  The upper       board contained both the ESA and the CEM high voltage power       supplies, while the low-voltage amplifier/discriminators, test       pulser, and digital-to-analog converters (DACs) were contained on       the lower board. The electrical interface from the IBS to the CAPS       DPU was a single 62-pin connector.         The CEM HV supply, which provided a negative bias voltage to the       three IBS detectors in parallel, was commanded by an 8-bit word       over a range of 0 to -4.0 kV. The ESA supplied biases to the inner       ESA hemisphere with a stepped negative potential that determined       the instantaneous energy of transmitted ions. For IBS to be able       to function as desired, the ESA HVPS had to cover the voltage       range -0.05 to -2600 V in 1.284% increments with a time between       steps of 7.8125 ms. In order to have sufficient resolution over       the entire voltage range, the ESA supply was designed with three       ranges (-0.05 to -1.85 V, -1.85 to -69.6 V, and -69.6 to -2600 V)       each of which was 12-bit controllable. This results in a total of       12,288 possible voltage steps although only 852 logarithmically       spaced steps were required for full coverage of the voltage range       with 1.284% spacing. During operation a 14-bit data word       controlling the ESA stepper supply was written to a latch in the       IBS electronics every 7.8125 ms (one-eighth of the IMS stepping       interval of 62.5 ms). The basic operational mode consisted of a       255-step voltage scan (corresponding to an energy scan) lasting       2 s.         IMS sensor electronics     ----------------------       This section describes the IMS electronics subsystems by tracing       the order in which signals are acquired and processed, namely FEE       (front-end-electronics) to TDC (time-to-digital converter) to SAM       (spectrum analyzer module), and then to CPU2.         Front-End Electronics       ----------------------         Once charge from an MCP detector was collected on an anode, it         enters a series of amplifiers, discriminators, and logic that         identifies the event and begins processing. In this discussion         the signals are identified as 'START' and 'STOP'. Both event         types are handled in essentially identical ways. When a START         event is detected the signal is split into two parts. One is         used to identify the location of the event in one of eight         elevation angles or one of the two stop channels (LEF or ST).         This part of the signal (termed the identification or ID signal)         is processed through fast (0.2 microsecond deadtime) preamp and         level-discriminators and can be used to correct for deadtime in         the slower (2.2 microsecond) circuits. The other 'half' of the         START signal is sent to the TDC where it triggers the timing         circuitry. Similar processes apply to the STOP signals.         Time-To-Digital Converter       ----------------------           Once a START pulse triggers the TDC, the state of the ID         discriminators is captured giving the identity of the event         origin. Subsequent START events are ignored for timing purposes         but are counted as ID events. Once initiated, the TDC converts         time directly into a digital word using a clock and vernier         technique in the following manner. A valid START enables a gated         80 MHz clock that increments a counter. A subsequent STOP that         occurs later than 40 ns (the pulse pair resolution of the TDC)         after the START event, inhibits that counter, thus providing a         coarse time measurement with a resolution of 12.5 ns. If no STOP         event was recorded the counter times out at 1600 ns,         corresponding to the longest time required for the heaviest,         lowest energy ions to cross the TOF optics as discussed above.         To obtain finer time resolution, the phase of the clock relative         to the clock edge is measured at the instant the STOP was         received by means of the delay line vernier implemented using a         12.5 ns delay line with 16 taps. As the STOP pulse propagates         down the delay line, a changing pattern of 1's and 0's appears         on the delay line taps. This pattern is latched at the end of         every clock period. When a STOP occurs the resulting digital         pattern represents the time of the STOP signal relative to the         clock edge. The FEE logic then encodes it into a binary word         that becomes the fine time measurement. Thus the TDC resolution         is effectively 12.5 ns/16 = 0.781 ns, corresponding to         1600 ns/0.781 ns = 2048 channels. If the TDC is instructed to         identify molecular events then the gated clock is fed to two         independent counters.  The first STOP causes one counter to be         inhibited and the vernier pattern to be read out and stored. The         second STOP inhibits the second counter and causes a second         vernier pattern to be read out.           There are several possible outcomes of events detected by the         TDC logic in addition to the ideal outcome (false events).         The rate of accidental coincidence events is dependent in a         complicated non-linear way on the total event rates.  False         events and background must be removed from IMS data before they         are usable.  After a TOF measurement is completed, the TDC         encodes an 11-bit TOF value, a 3-bit elevation sector value, a         resolution bit signaling ST or LEF data, and a 'continuation'         bit indicating a molecular event. Each 16-bit TOF word is then         sent to a first-in-first-out (FIFO) buffer read out by the         spectrum analyzer module (SAM).  The TDC is then reset in         preparation for the next measurement.           During a single IMS sampling period (62.5 ms) the TDC also         accumulates the number of ID events corresponding to the eight         start anodes, two stop anodes, two timing discriminator         channels, number of times when no coincident stop TOF event was         detected, total number of TOF measurements completed, and the         number of events recorded in two other configurable channels. 	These configurable channels can be set to be read out into the         data stream.  To achieve the best possible performance at high-         event rates, the TDC operates as a non-paralyzeable counter with         a fixed deadtime of 2.187 microseconds for TOF measurements. ID         measurements (collected in 'SINGLES' counters), on the other         hand, have a 0.2 microsecond deadtime making them suitable for         correcting the slower timing measurement rates. Finally, the         FEE/TDC system has built-in test pulsers that can stimulate any         START or STOP pair with one of 24 selectable time delays at         periodic event rates up to 1 MHz.         Spectrum Analyzer Module       ----------------------         The SAM processing method allows a high level of TOF data         compression (~1000:1) to be achieved with little sacrifice in         accuracy. The key to carrying out this process at high-event         rates and within the short IMS sampling interval (62.5ms) is a         high-speed, deterministic deconvolution technique that we will         refer to as the SAM algorithm. The hardware that supports this         algorithm has a distributed, pipelined architecture based on         four loosely coupled, reconfigurable modules.  Once SAM         processes a single data sample (i.e., data gathered in 62.5 ms)         they are transferred to the CPU2 processor and the cycle         repeated. Although data transfers from FEE to TDC and TDC to SAM         occur at random rates, control of all other processing, data         transfers and command and control functions are synchronized,         taking place during the final 12.5% (7.81 ms) of the sampling         interval.           Dual memory banks allow raw data acquisition to proceed while         CPU2 and SAM processors both access data from the previous 4.0s         acquisition interval. At the end of each interval, spectra that         were processed during the previous interval are read from SAM by         CPU2. In addition, new, selectively binned TOF spectra, are read         into the SAM processor. There, during the next measurement         interval, the SAM algorithm deconvolves TOF spectra, extracting         selected ion M/Q values. Once analysis is complete, SAM         interrupts CPU2, which then reads the M/Q-sorted data. SAM is         then ready for the next acquisition and processing cycle. SAM         operates as a CPU2 slave. The analysis algorithm is coded in the         Ada language and executed in the 1750A microprocessor module.         Its address space is accessible by CPU2, and program and local         data are loaded into the module by CPU2. However, SAM itself         cannot read or write to CPU2 memory. The three remaining modules         (TOF, TOFACC, and EVENT) are each autonomously controlled by         separate gate arrays. In order to speed up TOF data processing,         dedicated paths support concurrent data flow from the input FIFO         to the appropriate processing modules. In addition, each module         manages its own local processing and external access to data.         SAM acquires data from the TDC via a FIFO buffer at a maximum         rate of 5 x 105 periodic events/s. The FIFO can be configured by         command to enable dual-stop operation (for molecules) and data         acquisition from selected elevation ID channels.         Spectrum Analyzer Module       ----------------------         The IMS high voltage (HV) system was made up of five supplies         controlled independently by CPU1.  The supplies are contained in         two separate units:            1. nominally +/- 15 kV in HVU1            2. the two MCP supplies and ESA stepping supply in HVU2         All supplies feature current-limiting and breakdown protection,         as well as analog monitoring (digitized in the data stream).         HVU1 is powered by filtered +30 V from spacecraft primary power         whereas the HVU2 supplies use +15 V generated by CAPS.         High-voltage cables rated at >= 2.5 times the respective supply         voltages connect HVU1 and HVU2 to IMS sensor electrodes (40 kV         cables are used for HVU1 connections). All HV connectors were         custom designed and fabricated from low-void ceramic to prevent         high-electric field concentrations that might lead to HV         breakdown over the course of the mission. Metal covers placed         over the HV terminals reduce electric stresses and provide         mechanical as well as contamination protection.           The HVU1 supply is composed of independent positive and negative         voltage converters whose output is maintained at +/- 1% over all         line and temperature variations with very low ripple. The         primary purpose of HVU1 is to provide the negative and positive         high voltages that together create the LEF by correctly biasing         a string of 30-high ohmic resistors running the length of the         TOF ring stack. HVU1 also generates regulated 1200 V referenced         to -15 kV that is used to bias the first plate in the LEF MCP         stack. Because power for the LEF MCP regulator is derived from         the -15 kV supply the latter must reach a minimum of approx.         -12 kV in order for the LEF MCP to reach ~950 V and operate         correctly. A voltage drop of -100 V is placed on a grid in front         of the MCP to return secondary electrons to the MCP surface,         thus maintaining high efficiency.  To make a compact but         reliable unit, electric fields in the HVU1 supplies were kept         below 1 kV/mm relative to the grounded housing. Transformer and         high voltage assemblies were not encapsulated in order to avoid         multi-material composite structures that could introduce         mechanical stresses that might in turn lead to dielectric faults         and eventual breakdown. Instead, after fabrication and cleaning,         the interior surfaces and components were coated with         Parylene-C, a tough, low-outgasing polymer with high-dielectric         strength.           Both of the MCP supplies are located in the HVU2 as is the ESA         supply. The MCP supplies are virtually identical in construction         and operation, relying on a pulse-width modulator control         circuit and a resonant converter operating at a switching         frequency of 100 kHz. The capacitor networks provide rf         filtering. A resistor divider biases the field-correcting         aperture located at the ESA exit to approximately one half the         ESA plate potential. Another function of the MCP supplies, in         addition to powering the two detectors, is supplying a         suppression bias voltage to high transmission grids to return         secondary electrons to the MCP (the same function provided by         HVU1 for the LEF MCP). Similar potentials at the back of the         third stages of both detectors accelerate electron charge clouds         toward their respective anodes.     Calibration   ===========       ELS calibration     ---------------         ELS was calibrated in the Mullard Space Science Laboratory (MSSL)       electron calibration facility developed for Cluster       [JOHNSTONEETAL1997]. A mercury lamp generated UV that struck a       gold layer deposited on a quartz disk. From this, photoelectrons       were extracted by applying a bias potential to the gold surface,       creating an electron beam 15 cm in diameter with divergence less       than 1 degree (at 1 keV) and good uniformity over the ELS       aperture. During calibration ELS was mounted on a two-axis rotary       table and turned to allow electrons from defined directions to       enter (additional information regarding the calibration theory can       be found in [YOUNGETAL2004]). A micron-metal shield inside the       vacuum chamber shielded the calibration volume by reducing the       residual magnetic field to less than 10% that of the Earth.       Electron beams with energies above ~30 eV showed minimal       directional deviation.         Beam current measurements that provide absolute calibration were       made with a faraday cup and picoammeter.  During calibration       sequences beam stability was monitored with a CEM.  A tritium       source provided a cross check after each sensor re-configuration       to maintain consistency during calibration.         Calibration of the flight model was made at ten electron energies       between 2.3 and 16260 eV (see [YOUNGETAL2004] for details). Two       basic types of data were taken: First a finely stepped elevation       angular scan was made at constant energy and beam azimuth angle.       Second, a full three-dimensional calibration (energy, elevation,       azimuth) was obtained at defined resolutions in the three       dimensions. The most detailed calibrations were made at 125 and       960 eV.  In each case some 150,000 data points, corrected for dead       time and beam monitor readings, were summed to produce a plot.       The 8 anodes showed a nearly uniform response with some loss of       transmission at the two end anodes. This was to be expected because       the grid holder cuts off incident trajectories at +/- 80 degree       elevation. A summary of 125 and 960 eV calibration data can be       found in [YOUNGETAL2004].  Energy-angle scans with a 125eV       electron beam were made at the azimuthal center of each of the       eight anodes.  The plots generated showed the analyzer peformance       in 3-dimensions was consistent from one anode to the next and       deviated little from instrument simulations.         IBS calibration     ----------         Initial modeling of the IBS was chiefly concerned with determining       manufacturing tolerances required to achieve the desired       energy-angle resolution and transmission efficiency of the ESA       [VILPPOLAETAL1993]. Analysis of simulation results showed that it       was necessary to align the two ESA hemispheres relative to one       another with an accuracy of better than ~25 microns in order to       obtain the desired energy resolution of delta E/E = 0.015.       Furthermore, deviations of the ESA plate surfaces could not depart       from perfect sphericity by more than 300 microns (0.3% of plate       radius) if >90% transmission efficiency was to be maintained.         Initial calibration results showed that IBS responded as expected       except for the presence of a few small but unusual features. Of       these, a double-bend in the energy-polar angle response was the       most notable. To address these findings, a more accurate       simulation of the sensor was deve",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:cda.co,COSMIC DUST ANALYZER for CO,COSMIC DUST ANALYZER,"     Instrument Overview   ===================     The Cosmic Dust Analyser instrument (CDA) on the Cassini orbiter is   the successor of the dust detectors flown on the Ulysses and the   Galileo spacecraft. The instrument accomplishes the detection of   dust impacts by two different means: (1) a high rate detector (HRD)   using two separate polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) sensors, and   (2) a Dust Analyser (DA) based upon impact ionization.  The DA   measures the electric charges carried by the dust particle, the   impact direction, the impact speed, mass, and the chemical   composition, whereas the HRD is only capable to determine the mass   for particles with a known speed.  The DA detector consists of   three components: the charge detection unit, the impact ionization   detector itself, and the time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometer.     Note that the charge detection unit subsystem generates signals   (so-called  'QP signals')  with a higher sampling rate than the signals   generated by the impact ionization detector (QI, QT, QC, MP signals.)   Furthermore, as the charge detection unit subsystem is sensitive   to big particles only (> 5 microns), it was triggered only 6 times   during the cruise phase. Therefore, in order to keep the telemetry data   volume low, the QP signals were not always transmitted to Earth. This   explains why the QI, QT, QC and MP signals directories in the   PDS volumes may contain more signals than the QP directory.     For a detailed description of the instrument, please refer to   [SRAMAETAL2004B] (see CDAREFS.CAT). A separate instrument.cat file   will be provided for HRD.       The Charge Detection Unit   =========================     The charge detection unit (CDU) consists of 4 entrance grids   mounted in front of the ionization detector. The outermost and   innermost grids are grounded, while the two innermost inclined   grids are connected with a charge amplifier (QP charge signal).   A charged particle flying through the entrance grid system induces   its charge onto the innermost grids. The inclined grid mounting   leads to asymmetric signal shapes which allows the determination of   the particle direction as well as the particle speed within a   plane.     The Impact Ionization Detector   ==============================     The impact ionization detector consists of a hemispherical impact   target (small inner target made of Rhodium chemical analyser target   (CAT), a large outer target made of Gold impact ionization target   (IID), and the ion collector grid system. The plasma constituents   generated by the dust impact onto the impact target are separated   by the electric field between the target and the ion grid. The   plasma electrons are collected at the CAT (QC charge signal) and   the IID (QT charge signal), while most of the positive plasma ions   are collected at the ion collector grid system (QI charge signal).   Ions escaping the impact ionization detector are inducing their   charges onto the charge detection grids (QP charge signal).  The   particle mass and the impact speed is deduced from the evolution of   the impact plasma:  the charge yield of the impact plasma is a   function of the impactor's mass and velocity, while the plasma   charge rise time is dependent on the impact speed only.     The Time-of-flight (TOF) Mass Spectrometer   ==========================================     The TOF mass spectrometer consists of the chemical analyser target   (CAT), the chemical analyser grid located 3 mm in front of the CAT,   and the multiplier dynodes connected with the Dynode Logarithmic   Amplifier (MP signal). Due to the strong electric field between the   grid and the CAT, positive plasma ions are separated very quickly   from the plasma and accelerated toward the multiplier, forming a   time-of-flight mass spectrum.

The principal investigator is M. Flasar (GSFC).   The final design has evolved considerably since the original conception (KUNDEETAL1996). A description of the flight model of the instrument is given here; the reader is referred to technical publications in the literature (CALCUTTETAL1992, KUNDEETAL1996) for further technical details.

These were later combined into a single focal plane 1, covering the full range 10--600 cm-1.   The table summarises the principal instrument parameters. The optics assembly is comprised of a telescope, relay optics, and a pair of interferometers, covering the mid and far-IR spectral regions. Both interferometers share a common scan mechanism, as does a reference interferometer which controls the sampling rate and mirror movement. The other main components of CIRS are the detectors, the electronics assembly, and the passive radiative cooler. The entire instrument is maintained at 170K, except for the mid-IR detectors which are at ~80K.   The berylium telescope is a Cassegrain type, consisting of a 50.8 cm F/6 paraboloidal primary and a 7.6 cm hyperboloidal secondary, the same sizes as used by the Voyager Infrared Interferometer Spectrometer (IRIS). The primary mirror has a gold-enhanced surface for low-scattering. The beam then passes to two field stops, where one part of the field is relayed to the far-IR interferometer and the other to the mid-IR interferometer, via collimators and folding mirrors (see figures cirs_optics and cirs_mechanical). A shutter may be commanded into the light path of the mid-IR fore-optics for internal calibration.   The far-infrared interferometer (FIR) is of the Martin-Puplett type (MARTIN&PUPLETT1969), which uses wire-grid polarisers to split, recombine and analyse the radiation. This technique takes advantage of nearly ideal-response wire-grid polarisers, which have reflection and transmission co-efficients approaching 100% for both linear planes of polarisation, and over a wide spectral range. The 2-micron centre to centre wire spacing used in CIRS gives good response from 0--300 cm-1 and then decreasing response to 600 cm-1. The far-infrared focal plane assembly (FP1) uses two thermopile detectors to measure the final transmitted and reflected beams at the polariser-analyser, however if one fails the interferometer can still operate, albeit with a lower efficiency.   The 4.3 mrad diameter field of view (FOV) of the FIR detector is the same as the IRIS detector. CIRS represents an improvement however in terms of spectral range (10--200 cm-1 now being accessible) and also in throughput, due to the greater efficiency of the polarising grids over conventional mirrors in the far-IR.   The mid-infrared interferometer (MIR) is a conventional Michelson design which has a KBr beamsplitter and cube-corner retroreflectors. A germanium lens focuses the recombined beams onto the mid-IR focal plane, which covers the range 600--1400 cm-1 using two photodetector arrays. The FP3 array of 1X10 photoconductive detectors measures from 600--1100 cm-1, which includes prominent bands of acetylene, ethane, propane and nitriles. The FP4 array of 1X10 photovoltaic detectors covers 1100--1400 cm-1. This range includes the important 1304 cm-1 band of methane.   CIRS sensitivity is improved substantially over the IRIS instrument in the MIR due to the use of cooled HgCdTe detectors rather than a thermopile. The mid-infrared focal plane is thermally isolated from the rest of the instrument by a tripod of low-conductance titanium alloy supports. At the rear of the focal plane, a flexible copper link connects to a cold finger, which extends from the passive radiative cooler. This patch is of aluminium honeycomb painted with conductive black paint, which radiates to a 2-pi field of view of deep space.   The temperature of the mid-IR focal plane can be set via ground control to temperatures between 70 and 90K, by balancing the cooling effect of the patch with the application of a small heater, to an accuracy of 0.1K.   This improved sensitivity allows for a much smaller FOV: each pixel has a 0.273 mrad square field of view, (c.f. Voyager IRIS 4.3 mrad) although the response across this field is not flat. The spatial response is given elsewhere in the documentation (CIRS_FOV_Overview.pdf). This much smaller FOV allows for much higher spatial resolution on the limb than IRIS, with a resolution of less than one scale height in the stratospheres of both Saturn and Titan.   The relative sizes and alignment of the FIR and MIR fields of view is depicted in figure (cirs-fov). Due to constraints on the available mass for electronics, the ten detectors on each of the mid-IR focal planes may not be used at once. Instead, five from each array can be used simultaneously, in one of four modes (see figure modes): odd detectors, even detectors, reduced field of view (centre detectors only), or reduced resolution mode. This allows considerable versatility in operation.   Both the FIR and the MIR interferometers share a common scan mechanism and Reference Interferometer (RI), which is a red light laser (785 nm) diode source. This provides the reference fringes used to create timing signals for data logging, and for feedback control of the mirror speed. The scan time is set in units of 1/8 second (=1 RTI) from 2--52s, which takes the mechanism to the maximum mirror travel distance of 1.04cm. The scan time controls the spectral resolution, from 20--0.5 cm-1.   CIRS also provides an option for co-adding two consecutive interferograms in an on-board buffer before downlink, which halves the data rate. To enable this, the zero path difference (ZPD) of each interferogram must be determined on board, which requires an additional white light interferogram to be produced for reference. A white light source is provided in the RI for this purpose, which is an LED of centre wavelength 870nm and FWHM 70nm, and shares the optics with the laser.   Decontamination heaters are also provided which can increase the instrument temperature to ~270K to drive off contaminants which may have condensed on the optics or detectors.

They were mounted on opposite sides of       the spacecraft, allowing at least one to obtain star field       coverage at all times without interference from the Sun.  Each       could provide three-axis attitude determination from a single       image provided the Sun, Moon, and Earth were not in the field       of view.         The primary function of the star tracker cameras was to provide       stellar images that were processed against an onboard star       catalog to find pointing, thus establishing absolute angular       references for attitude determination.  The scientific uses of       the cameras were secondary.  Only broad band operation was       available.  Owing to the line-transfer electronic shuttering,       imaging was limited to dim targets such as the lunar surface       illuminated by earth shine.         The Wide-Field-of-View Star Tracker cameras have a concentric       optics design with a fiber optic field flattener to couple the       image surface to a CCD array.  The CCD is kept cleared by       continuously shifting lines and reading out pixels at the 5 MHz       base rate, which is approximately 100 microseconds per line.       Image acquisition is accomplished by stopping this clearing       process for the appropriate integration time (13-bit       programmable), then proceeding with a second line-shifting       operation into a readout buffer.         The Thomson focal plane array (FPA) used is a frame-transfer       device, accomplishing electronic shuttering by rapidly shifting       the active pixel area into the storage area, pausing for the       13-bit programmable shuttering system spectral integration       time, then rapidly shifting the captured image into a storage       buffer from which the image is read out.  Post-FPA electronics       allow three gain states followed by 5 bits of offset that span       248 counts in the analog regime to augment the basic 8-bit       analog/digital (A/D) conversion.  Gain is A/D digitization       noise limited, so proper exposure is critical.  System noise is       about 1.0 bits rms at the highest sensitivity setting.         Scientific Objectives     =====================       Science observations of the star tracker cameras were limited       to dim targets such as the lunar surface illuminated by earth       shine and observations of the earth illuminated by moon shine       during the low earth orbit phase.  Additionally the star       tracker camera was used to acquire lunar 'horizon glow'       observations and solar corona observations prior to sun rise       over the Moon.         Calibration     ===========       The Star Tracker cameras were calibrated before launch.       Laboratory observations of a flat field under various operating       temperatures and camera operation modes provides information       about the sensitivity of the camera under expected spaceflight       conditions.  During inflight operations, a variety of       calibration observations were made including images of stars       with known radiance (Vega).         Operational Considerations     ==========================       Most star tracker observations used for spacecraft attitdue       determination were acquired prior to and after a pass over the       sunlit side of the Moon.  No star tracker observations were       made on the sunlit side of the lunar surface due to the extreme       sensitivity of the cameras and the potential for damage.         Operational Modes     =================       The Star Tracker Cameras had three operating modes:         1. 13-bit programmable integration time.  The range of integration       times (in microseconds) is given by:       Integration Time = [(N+3)*94.5 - 45, N=0,2,3...2**13]         2. Gain Mode. The gain mode represents the multiplicative constant       applied to the image data passing through the A/D converter.       Three gain state settings were available (1,2,4) although gain       setting 4 was seldom used during lunar observations.         3. Offset Mode. The offset mode represents the additive constant       applied to the image data passing through the A/D converter.       There were 14 offset mode settings (1-14) although offset modes       1 and 6 were predominantly used during systematic lunar       observations.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:clem1.hires,LIDAR HIGH-RESOLUTION IMAGER for CLEM1,LIDAR HIGH-RESOLUTION IMAGER,"               Online Reference: http://wundow.wustl.edu/clbin/clsearch.pl      Instrument Overview   ===================    The High Resolution Imaging (HIRES) camera combines a lightweight    beryllium telescope with an image intensifier-coupled frame    transfer charge couple device (CCD) imager.  Image shuttering is    accomplished through voltage gating of the image intensifier.      Maximum integration time is 733 milliseconds with 10.67 microsecond    increments.  Spectral response is limited in the system by the S-2    photo cathode between 0.4 and 0.8 microns. Five spectral bands can    be selected from a filter wheel which is controlled through the    serial-addressable synchronous interface (SASI).  A sixth filter    position is allocated to an opaque filter for the protection of the    photocathode and image intensifier.      The post-FPA electronics circuitry is identical to that used in the    UVVIS camera.  Images of the dayside of the moon used intensifier    gate times with relatively low gain settings on the order of 1    millisecond.      Lifetime concerns about the photocathode and micro channel plates    in the intensifier unit drove operational settings to low    exposures.  This resulted in photon shot noise contributing    significantly to the overall noise in the HIRES sensor.      Additionally, the image intensifier imposed a nonuniformity on    images. This yielded images that did not compress well using the    MATRA optimized rms algorithm. For this reason, JPEG compression,    which discards high spatial frequency detail, was employed on the    Hires images.      The Hires performance specifications are provided below.      Scientific Objectives    =====================    The HIRES camera was used primarily to photograph the lunar poles    at very high resolutions ranging from 10 to 15 meters/pixel    (effective resolution of 40 to 60 meters when taking into account    the 4 pixel point spread function of the instrument).  Polar    observations were made primarily with the 750nm spectral filter    (filter wheel position D).  Because of the narrow field-of-view of    the HIRES camera overlapping coverage of the HIRES imaging was not    possible between -80 to 80 degrees latitude.      The HIRES camera was also used to make high-resolution color    observations of special targets such as the Apollo landing sites    and Earth seen from lunar orbit.        Calibration    ===========    The radiometric calibration converts the digitized signal received    from the camera (DN value) into a quantity that is proportional to    the radiance reaching the sensor.  The sensitivity of the CCD focal    plane array varies across the field of view but appears to be time    invariant during the two month lunar observation period.  The HIRES    camera was calibrated before launch.  Laboratory observations of a    flat field under various operating temperatures and camera    operation modes provides information about the sensitivity of the    camera under expected spaceflight conditions.  During inflight    operations, a variety of calibration observations were made    including images of stars with known radiance (Vega) and the Apollo    Landing sites where laboratory spectra of returned lunar samples    have been measured.      Geometric calibration removes optical distortions of the imaging    system.  The geometric distortion of the HIRES camera has been    shown to be minimal (maximum optical distortion does not exceed 0.1    pixels) and can be satisfactorily modeled by a 2nd order    polynomial.      In regards to the HiRes 750nm Strip Mosaics Archive (DATA_SET_ID =    CLEM1-L-H-5-DIM-MOSAIC-V1.0, PDS volumes CL_6001 through    CL_6022), the Hires geometric and photometric calibrations were    referenced to the UVVIS Basemap Mosaic.  The geometric calibration    was achieved through a constrained registration of map-projected,    nadir-pointed Hires images against the UVVIS Basemap Mosaic, which    is the de facto lunar control network. An approximate photometric    calibration was performed on Hires mosaic tiles of sufficiently    limited extent (1.75 degrees of latitude) that the photometric    response was approximately constant.  Then, the linear stretch    which matches the underlying UVVIS Baseline Mosaic approximates the    photometric calibration of the Hires tile.      For additional information on the geometric and radiometric    calibration of the Clementine imaging systems, contact the PDS    Imaging Node.        Operational Considerations    ==========================    Lifetime concerns about the photocathode and micro channel plates    on the HIRES camera led to several decisions on the operation of    the camera during the lunar mapping phase of the mission.  The    primary objective of the HIRES camera was to have been high-    resolution color imaging of the asteroid Geographos; lunar    observations were of secondary importance.  The Geographos fly-by    was abandoned due to a spacecraft malfunction that caused a spin up    of the spacecraft and loss of attitude control on May 7, 1994.  The    HIRES camera was essentially 'turned off' during the lunar    observations between the latitude ranges -50 to 50 degrees, thereby    preserving the life of the instrument.  The imaging system remained    active at this time due to the electronic coupling with the LIDAR    altimeter but the camera was set so that no real imaging was    acquired.  The result is that most HIRES images acquired at mid-    latitudes are not usable.      The unusable HIRES imaging was included in the archive of EDR data    products in order to form a complete set of all data returned by    the spacecraft.  At high latitudes low camera settings were used to    ensure the HIRES camera would be undamaged for the Geographos    encounter.  Thus, the signal/noise ratio of the HIRES imaging data    during the lunar mapping phase is less than ideal.  Photon shot    noise and the 'honey comb' noise pattern of the intensifier is    evident in most of the lunar images.      The pole-to-pole lunar observations provided scenes with a broad    range of viewing conditions, ranging from bright observations near    zero phase angle at the equator to very low light-level    observations at the poles.  In order to properly record an    observation with an optimal signal-to-noise ratio it is important    to adequately fill the 8-bit (255 levels) dynamic range of the A/D    camera output.  The integration time (exposure time) and the gain    and offset settings of the instrument were adjusted to properly    record each image.  During the systematic mapping, the gain state    of the camera was normally set to lower values for the mid-latitude    observations and set to higher levels (thereby increasing the    sensitivity of the A/D converter) at the higher latitudes.    Integration times were rarely increased as observations approached    the poles, nominally being set to 1.067 ms.  Lunar observations    were broken into 10 latitude bins.  Each latitude bin nominally    contained fixed gain and offset modes and integration times for    each camera/filter combination, although occasional offlooking    slews that fell within a bin other than that corresponding to the    subspacecraft point resulted in images with differing acquisition    settings.      The Clementine orbit was designed to provide overlapping coverage    in both the down-track (~15% overlap) and cross-track (~10% overlap    at the equator) directions.  The image overlap is necessary to    geometrically control images in cartographic applications.        Operational Modes    =================    The HIRES camera had four operating modes:      1. Programmable integration time.  (up to 733 milliseconds in 10.67    millisecond steps)      2. A/D Gain Mode. The gain mode represents the multiplicative    constant applied to the image data passing through the A/D    converter. Three gain state settings were available (1,2,4).      3. A/D Offset Mode. The offset mode represents the additive    constant applied to the image data passing through the A/D    converter. There were 14 offset mode settings (1-14).      4. Microchannel Plate Gain Mode. The mode provided gain control on    the microchannel plate. (8-bit, 255 step gain control).

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:clem1.lidar,LASER RANGEFINDER for CLEM1,LASER RANGEFINDER,"           Instrument Overview     ===================       Laser Rangefinder (LIDAR): The LIDAR unit shares the       telescope of the HiRes camera, splitting the 1064 nm       return signal from the NdYag source off to an avalanche       photodiode (APD) detector with dichroic filter. The       optics are non-imaging, providing an exit pupil through       simple relay optics at the APD. The APD electronics       include a temperature compensation feature for the APD       bias voltage and programmable thresholding of the output       signal. The APD current is amplified and inverted to a       voltage by a transimpedance amplifier with a gain of 230X,       a low frequency cutoff of 3 MHz, and a high frequency       cutoff of 23 MHz.  The voltage derived from the APD       current is amplified, then discriminated for changes       (increase) through a 14 MHz discriminator.  Voltage       changes exceeding the programmed threshold are flagged       as returns [NOZETTEETAL1994].         The LIDAR instrument measured the slant range from the       spacecraft to the lunar surface at spacecraft altitudes of       640 km or less.  These measurements were used to determine       the global lunar topography field.         Scientific Observations     =======================       Throughout the Lunar Mapping phase of the mission, the       LIDAR system acquired high resolution profiles of lunar       topography.  Over those parts of each revolution where       radio tracking of the spacecraft was possible, variations       in the gravity field of the Moon could be measured.  The       combination of topography profiles and gravity maps places       important constraints on the interior structure of the       Moon.  The orbital topography data were gridded and used       to produce a spherical harmonic topography model (GLTM-       2B).  This topographic model represents the first reliable       global characterization of surface heights for the Moon       [ZUBERETAL1994].         Calibration     ===========       N/A         Operational Considerations     ==========================       Below 640 km, the instrument had adequate sensitivity to       obtain range measurements from both mare and highland       surfaces.  While the ranging success rate for all       measurements was ~20%, many more successful returns were       obtained from the smooth mare surfaces than the rougher       highlands.  However, the distribution of points allowed a       qualitative physical description of the shape of the       Moon.         Detectors     =========       The LIDAR uses a avalanche photodiode (APD) detector with       a dichroic filter.         Electronics     ===========       The APD electronics includes a temperature compensation       feature for the APD bias voltage and programmable       thresholding of the output signal.         Filters     =======       There were no instrument filters.         Optics     ======       The optics are non-imaging, providing an exit pupil       through simple relay optics at the APD.         Operational Modes     =================       The Clementine LIDAR operated in two distinct modes, 'ON'       and 'OFF'.  There was also the ability to range at 8Hz,       and this was done several times the week before the       spacecraft left the Moon.         Subsystems     ==========       N/A         Measured Parameters     ===================       The LIDAR instrument measured the slant range from the       spacecraft to the lunar surface at spacecraft altitudes of       640 km or less.  Clock cycles were returned which were       then converted to range by a multiplicative factor.       Basically, the range value was determined by the number of       clock cycles between the laser start pulse and the       received signal.  These cycles were time-tagged, and from       the time tag it was possible to reconstruct the latitude       and longitude position on the surface by knowing the       spacecraft orbit and orientation.  The instrument       collected data for approximately one-half hour per 5-hour       orbit during the 2-month lunar mapping mission       [ZUBERETAL1994].         The clock counter has only 14 bits owing to hardware       availability limitations.  In order to allow returns up to       the 640 km maximum range required in the lunar mission,       returns are binned four to a clock count, turning the 15       MHz response into a 39.972 meter height bin.  Internal       memory in the LIDAR unit saves up to six 'returns' per       laser firing, with up to four saved in the programmable       search range.  The programmable search range simply refers       to the range of possible detection thresholds, defined as       a fixed number of set 10 mV voltage levels which had to be       exceeded [NOZETTEETAL1994].         The detection threshold was never formally 'confirmed'.       It was selected on the basis of: 1) a link analysis, which       is a statistical analysis which looks at how to maximize       the probability of getting a valid hit while minimizing       the probability of triggering the detector due to solar       background or electronic noise; and 2) experience on how       the instrument was operating in orbit.  Clementine mission       scientists or the LLNL engineers manually uploaded the       threshold values every day, and the values were dependent       on: spacecraft orbital height, surface albedo (maria or       highlands), sun angle (sunlit or dark), and instrument       gain.         During the course of the mission the LIDAR typically       ranged at a rate of 1 shot per 1.6 seconds and triggered       on about 123,000 shots, corresponding to 19% of the       transmitted laser pulses.  Typical along-track shot       spacings were on the order of 20 km, but this varied       considerably [ZUBERETAL1994].

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:clem1.lwir,LONG WAVELENGTH INFRARED CAMERA for CLEM1,LONG WAVELENGTH INFRARED CAMERA,"               Online Reference: http://wundow.wustl.edu/clbin/clsearch.pl        Instrument Overview     ===================       The Longwave Infrared Camera (LWIR) camera uses a catadioptric       lens with a 128 x 128 mercury cadmium telluride (HCT) focal       plane array (FPA).  The FPA was mechanically cooled to       cryogenic temperatures during operation with a temperature set       point goal of 65 K.  The optics design incorporates an internal       relay with 100% cold shield efficiency.  Wavelength range was       controlled by the cold filter to between 8.0 and 9.5 microns.         Camera electronic design is virtually identical to the NIR       camera, with a minor alteration in line readout to compensate       for the difference in column count between the two arrays (256       for the NIR, 128 for the LWIR).  The NIR and LWIR cameras also       share a common cryocooler and dewar design, with minor       modifications made to accommodate cold shield and cold filter       differences.         Scientific Objectives     =====================       The LWIR camera performed thermal observations of the Lunar       surface in the broad-band spectral region centered at 8750       nanometers.  Because of the narrow field-of-view of the LWIR       camera, overlapping coverage in the cross track-direction was       not possible between -80 and +80 degrees of latitude.         Calibration     ===========       The radiometric calibration converts the digitized signal       received from the camera (DN value) into a quantity that is       proportional to the radiance reaching the sensor.  The       sensitivity of the CCD focal plane array varies across the       field of view.  The instrument response is sensitive to the       temperatures of the FPA, optics, and cryocooler.  During       mission operations it was discovered that a sufficient       cryocooler cool-down period was needed before temperatures of       the instrument became stable.         The LWIR camera was calibrated before launch.  Laboratory       observations of a flat field under various operating       temperatures and camera operation modes provide information       about the sensitivity of the camera under expected spaceflight       conditions.  During inflight operations, calibration observations       were made over the Apollo 17 Landing site where surface       temperatures were measured in-situ.         Geometric calibration removes optical distortions of the       imaging system.  The geometric distortion of the LWIR camera       has been shown to be minimal (maximum optical distortion does       not exceed 0.1 pixels) and can be satisfactorily modeled by a       radially dependent 2nd order polynomial.         For additional information of radiometric calibration of the       LWIR camera see [LAWSONETAL2000].       Operational Modes     =================       The LWIR camera had three operating modes:         1.  Four selectable image integration times (0.144, 0.92, 2.30,       4.60 ms) were available, but only 0.144 ms was used.         2.  Gain Mode.  The gain mode represents the multiplicative       constant applied to the image data passing through the A/D       converter.  There were 32 (5 bit) gain state settings were available.         3.  Offset Mode.  The offset mode represents the additive       constant applied to the image data passing through the A/D       converter.  There were 256 (8 bit) offset mode settings.

The FPA operated       at 70 K plus-or-minus 0.5 K at the Moon and showed excellent       stability over the more than 500 hours of operation in space.       The lens design features all ZnSe refractive elements with a       relay to provide an external pupil for 100% efficient cold       shielding.  This lens design was chosen for image quality and       focus stability.         Wavelength range was constrained by the optics and the InSb       response to between 1.0 and 5.5 microns.  Six wavebands were       selected by the NASA advisory committee, all falling well       inside this range.         Programmable camera electronics allow 4 integration times, 5       bits of gain, and 8 bits of offset.  Gain states are spaced       approximately evenly from 0.5 to 36 factors of voltage       multiplication.  Offset is subtracted before gain is applied,       with a range from 0 volts to full well that can be set in 1/255       full well increments.         Scientific Objectives     =====================       The primary scientific objective of the NIR was to support       lunar mineral mapping investigations.  Pole-to-pole NAIDR       observations with solar phase angles kept to less than 30       degrees at mid-latitudes were the predominant viewing       conditions during the two month systematic mapping phase of the       mission.  The UVVIS and NIR cameras provided 100% coverage of       the lunar surface under 11 spectral bands ranging in       wavelengths from 415 to 2690 nm.  Image resolution ranges from       100 meters/pixel at periselene (-28 degrees south latitude       during first month observations, +28 degrees the second month)       to 400 meters/pixel at the poles.         Calibration     ===========       The radiometric calibration converts the digitized signal       received from the camera (DN value) into a quantity that is       proportional to the radiance reaching the sensor.  The       sensitivity of the CCD focal plane array varies across the       field of view.  The instrument response is sensitive to the       temperatures of the FPA, optics, and cyrocooler.  During       mission operations it was discovered that a sufficient       cryocooler cool-down period was needed before temperatures of       the instrument became stable.  NIR images at the start of an       observational pass over the Moon just prior to turning on the       cryocooler may be difficult to calibrate due to temperature       instabilities of the instrument.         The NIR camera was calibrated before launch.  Laboratory       observations of a flat field under various operating       temperatures and camera operation modes provide information       about the sensitivity of the camera under expected spaceflight       conditions.  During inflight operations, a variety of       calibration observations were made including Apollo Landing       site observations where laboratory spectra of returned lunar       samples have been measured.         Geometric calibration removes optical distortions of the       imaging system.  The geometric distortion of the NIR camera has       been shown to be minimal (maximum optical distortion does not       exceed 3.0 pixels) and can be satisfactorily modeled by a 2nd       order polynomial.         For additional information on the geometric and radiometric       calibration of the Clementine imaging systems, contact the PDS       Imaging Node.         Operational Considerations     ==========================       The pole-to-pole lunar observations provided scenes with a       broad range of viewing conditions, ranging from bright       observations near zero phase angle at the equator to very low       light-level observations at the poles.  In order to properly       record an observation with an optimal signal-to-noise ratio it       is important to adequately fill the 8-bit (255 levels) dynamic       range of the A/D camera output.  The integration time (exposure       time) and the gain and offset operating modes of the instrument       were adjusted to properly record each image.  Lunar       observations were broken into 10 latitude bins.  Each latitude       bin contained fixed gain and offset modes and integration times       for each camera/filter combination.         The Clementine orbit was designed to provide overlapping       coverage in both the down-track (~15% overlap) and cross-track       (~10% overlap at the equator) directions.  The image overlap is       necessary to geometrically control images in cartographic       applications.         Operational Modes     =================       The NIR camera had three operating modes:         1. Four selectable image integration times (11, 33, 57, 95 ms)         2. Gain Mode. The gain mode represents the multiplicative       constant applied to the image data passing through the A/D       converter.  Thirty two (5 bit) gain state settings were       available.         3. Offset Mode. The offset mode represents the additive constant       applied to the image data passing through the A/D converter.       There were 256 (8 bit) offset mode settings.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:clem1.rss,RADIO SCIENCE SUBSYSTEM for CLEM1,RADIO SCIENCE SUBSYSTEM,"       Instrument Overview     ===================       The Clementine spacecraft telecommunications subsystem       served as part of a Radio Science instrument for       investigations of the Moon.  The remainder of the       'instrument' was located at ground stations of the NASA Deep       Space Network (DSN).  Much of the equipment at both ends was       shared, being used for routine telecommunications as well as       for Radio Science.  Radio data were themselves shared;       Doppler and range measurements were used to calculate the       spacecraft trajectory and to infer the lunar gravity field.       Measurements of signal parameters after waves had interacted       with the lunar surface were used to infer physical and       electrical properties of the surface material.         Instrument Overview - Spacecraft     ================================       The spacecraft telecommunications subsystem provided       simultaneous radio frequency (RF) uplink, downlink, and       coherent tracking capabilities with DSN ground stations       [REGEONETAL1994].  Clementine used two S-band (2.0-2.3 GHz)       omni-directional antennas for low data rate communications       and a body-fixed 1.1 m diameter composite parabolic       reflector with a deployable feed for high data rate       communications.  The omni antennas were configured such that       commands could be received over a wide range of spacecraft       orientations.  Two S-Band transponder units provided the       transmit and receive functions for the spacecraft.  Each       transponder contained one exciter and solid-state       transmitter and one fixed-tuned phase-locked loop receiver       (2093.0542 MHz).  In addition, the subsystem contained three       diplexers, two 10 dB couplers, and a transfer switch.                            ----------------------------------------                         |                                        |                         v                                        |                     --------                                     |  HGA               |        |                                    | \     ----------   | Switch |--                                  |  \   |          |<-|        |  |                                 |   >--| Diplexer |   --------   |                                 |  /   |          |-      ^      |                                 | /     ----------  |     |      |                                 |                   |      --------------------------------------- |                   |            |    --------     -----   -----  ||                    --------------->| 90 deg |   | CMD | | PCM | ||  OMNI-A                        | --| Hybrid |    -----   -----  || \                              ||   --------       ^       ^    ||  \                ----------   ||       |          |       |    ||   ><--      ---->|          |<- |       v          v       v    ||  /    |    |     | Diplexer |   |   ---------    -------------  || /     v    v     |          |----->|  10 dB  |  | RCVR | XMTR |- |      --------     ----------    |  | Coupler |->|   A  |   A  |  |     | 90 deg |                  |   ---------    -------------   |     | Hybrid |                  |   ---------    -------------   |      --------     ----------     ->|  10 dB  |  | RCVR | XMTR |-- \     ^    ^     |          |----->| Coupler |->|   B  |   B  |  \    |    |     | Diplexer |       ---------    -------------   ><--      ---->|          |---                   ^       ^  /                ----------    |                  |       | /                               /                  v       v  OMNI-B                         \                -----   -----                                 /               | CMD | | PCM |                                 \                -----   -----                                 |                                ---                               ///           Both spacecraft receivers were powered on at all times       during the mission.  Ranging signals, uplinked independently       or during commanding, were demodulated by the receiver and       passed on to the transmitter for re-transmission to Earth.       The receiver's automatic gain control was commanded off to       allow tracking of the uplink signal through nulls in the       antenna pattern as the spacecraft spun.         The exact frequency of the signal transmitted from the       spacecraft could be controlled in two ways -- by locking to       a signal received from a ground station or by locking to an       on-board oscillator.  These are known as the coherent (or       'two-way') and non-coherent ('one-way') modes, respectively.       When operating in the coherent mode, the transponder carrier       frequency was derived from the received uplink carrier       frequency with a 'turn-around ratio' of 240/221.  In the       non-coherent mode, the downlink carrier frequency was       derived from the spacecraft on-board crystal-controlled       oscillator.  After a 3-hour warm-up, the nominal crystal       oscillator frequency was 2273.000+/-0.002 MHz.         Solid state amplifiers, driven at saturation, amplified the       multiplier output before the signals were radiated via       either the high-gain parabolic antenna or the low gain omni-       directional antennas.  The signal transmitted by each of the       Clementine antennas was right circularly polarized.         Pertinent details of the subsystem are shown below; its       'build date' is taken to be 1994-01-01, which was during the       Pre-Launch phase of the Clementine mission.

The +X axis vector was       parallel to the nominal direction of the main thruster       nozzle, and the -X axis vector was parallel to the       spacecraft high-gain antenna (HGA) boresight.  The +Y axis       vector formed a right-handed coordinate system and was in       the nominal direction of the solar panel rotation axis.  The       low-gain 'omni-directional' antennas were mounted on the +Z       and -Z sides of the spacecraft body.  The spacecraft       velocity vector was in approximately the -X direction when       the spacecraft was oriented for nadir viewing.  The nominal       HGA S-band polarization was right-hand circular in the -X       direction.

Smith and Maria T. Zuber.  The Principal       Investigator for the radio occultation and radio scattering       experiments was Christopher L. Lichtenberg.         Scientific Objectives     =====================       Two different types of radio science experiments were       conducted with Clementine: radio tracking experiments in       which the magnitude and direction of the planet's gravity       field were derived from the Doppler and ranging       measurements, and radio propagation experiments in which       modulation on the signal received on Earth could be       attributed to properties of the intervening medium.  Two       types of radio propagation experiments were carried out:       radio occultations by the lunar limb and scattering from the       lunar surface.           Gravity Measurements         --------------------         Measurement of the gravity field provides significant         constraints on inferences about interior structure of the         Moon.  Precise, detailed study of the spacecraft motion in         lunar orbit can yield the mass distribution of the target         body.  Topographic data obtained by the Clementine laser         altimeter forms a critical adjunct to these measurements         since only after the gravitational effects are adjusted         for topography can the gravity anomalies be interpreted         geophysically [ZUBERETAL1994].           Studies of the gravity field emphasize both the global         field and local characteristics of the field.  The first         task is to determine the global field.  Doppler and range         tracking measurements yield accurate spacecraft trajectory         solutions.  Simultaneously with reconstruction of the         spacecraft orbit, observation equations for field         coefficients and a small number of ancillary parameters         can be solved [BALMINO1981].  This type of gravity field         solution is essential for characterizing large scale         phenomena and can also be used to study localized         features.           'Short-arc' line-of-sight Doppler tracking measurements         obtained when the Earth-to-spacecraft line-of-sight is         within a few degrees of the orbit plane provide the         highest resolution of local features.  The results from         this type of observation typically are presented as         contoured acceleration profiles of specific features         (e.g., craters, ridges, etc.) or line-of-sight         acceleration maps of specific regions.  The high spatial         resolution of these products makes them especially useful         to geophysicists for study of features in the size range         of 300 to 1,000 km.  Because of the relative simplicity of         the data analysis, results can be available within a few         days after the data are collected [SJOGRENETAL1976].             Radio Occultation Measurements         ------------------------------         Radio measurements during occultations can provide         information on topography along the target body limb.         When combined with accurate reconstructions of the         spacecraft trajectory, the time at which occultation         occurs provides a precise estimate of the occultation         point distance from the target center-of-mass         [LINDALETAL1979].  Differences between the ideal         diffraction signature expected from a 'knife-edge'         opaque screen can also be used to infer details of         surface structure in the vicinity of the limb.             Bistatic Surface Scattering Measurements         ----------------------------------------         When the spacecraft telecommunications antenna is pointed         toward the surface of the target, the strength of the         scattered signal from the illuminated area may be         interpreted in terms of the texture of the surface at that         point [SIMPSON1993].  In experiments conducted on         1994-04-10, the Clementine high-gain antenna was aimed         toward a single target area -- the lunar south pole (the         so-called 'spotlight mode') -- and the scattered signal         was recorded at DSN stations in California, Australia,         and Spain as the spacecraft moved in its orbit.  On         1993-04-23, the spacecraft high-gain antenna was aimed         toward the lunar north pole in another spotlight         experiment; those signals were received at the Canberra         and Madrid DSN sites.  On 1994-04-23 the spacecraft         antenna was also aimed toward the specular point on the         lunar surface for part of a single orbit (the 'quasi-         specular' experiment mode).  In that case, the mirror-like         reflected signal was received at the DSN station near         Madrid; the quasi-specular echo is much stronger than the         echo obtained in other configurations.           Spotlight experiments, conducted on polar targets were         designed to detect and measure enhanced backscatter from         possible ice deposits in areas permanently shaded from         solar illumination.  Such enhancements have been seen in         Earth-based radar studies of the Galilean satellites         [CAMPBELLETAL1978], Mars [MUHLEMANETAL1991], and Mercury         [HARMONETAL1994].  Although Earth-based radar studies of         the Moon [STACY1993] have had considerably better         sensitivity and surface resolution than this experiment,         the Clementine geometry uniquely allowed measurements as a         function of the bistatic angle -- the separation angle         between transmitter and receiver [SIMPSON1993].  The         angular variation of any enhancement may be related to         the distance the radar signal travels through the ice and,         hence, to the thickness and/or clarity of the ice at 13 cm         wavelength.         Operational Considerations     ==========================       Descriptions given here are for nominal performance.  The       spacecraft transponder system comprised redundant units,       each with slightly different characteristics.  As       transponder units age, their performance changes slightly.       More importantly, the performance for Radio Science depended       on operational factors such as the modulation state for the       transmitters, which cannot be predicted in advance.  The       performance also depended on factors which were not always       under the control of the Clementine Project.         Clementine telemetry data were sent to Earth at user       selectable rates between 125 bits per second and 125       kilobits per second.  During radio occultation and radio       scattering experiment periods, telemetry modulation was       usually turned off; no special modulation requirements were       applied during tracking for gravity field determination.         Calibration     ===========       No information is available on calibration of the radio       system.         Measurements of the high gain antenna radiation pattern were       made on an engineering model of the antenna.         Operational Modes     =================       The Clementine telecommunications system could be viewed as       having two sections, which could be operated in the       following modes:         Section      Mode       -------------------------------------------       Oscillator   two-way (coherent)                    one-way (non-coherent)       RF output    low-gain antenna                    high-gain antenna         Selected parameters describing transponder performance are       listed below:         Oscillator Parameters:                      S-Band          Two-Way Transponder Turnaround Ratio     240/221          One-Way Transmit Frequency (MHz)         2273.000          Frequency Uncertainty (+/- MHz)          0.002          Nominal Wavelength (cm)                  13.2         RF Output parameters:                       S-Band          RF Transmitter Power Output (w)          7          Low-Gain Antenna:            Half-Power Half Beamwidth (deg)        70            Gain (dBi)                             0            EIRP (dBm)                             39            Polarization                           Right Circular          High-Gain Antenna:            Half-Power Half-Beamwidth (deg)        4.0            Gain (dBi)                             26.2            EIRP (dBm)                             65.2            Polarization                           Right Circular         Instrument Overview - DSN     =========================       Three Deep Space Communications Complexes (DSCCs) (near       Barstow, CA; Canberra, Australia; and Madrid, Spain) comprise       the DSN tracking network.  Each complex is equipped with       several antennas [including at least one each 70-m, 34-m High       Efficiency (HEF), and 34-m standard (STD)], associated       electronics, and operational systems.  Primary activity at each       complex is radiation of commands to and reception of telemetry       data from active spacecraft.  Transmission and reception is       possible in several radio-frequency bands, the most common       being S-band (nominally a frequency of 2100-2300 MHz or a       wavelength of 14.2-13.0 cm) and X-band (7100-8500 MHz or 4.2-       3.5 cm).  Transmitter output powers of up to 400 kw are       available.         Ground stations have the ability to transmit coded and uncoded       waveforms which can be echoed by distant spacecraft.  Analysis       of the received coding allows navigators to determine the       distance to the spacecraft; analysis of Doppler shift on the       carrier signal allows estimation of the line-of-sight       spacecraft velocity.  Range and Doppler measurements are used       to calculate the spacecraft trajectory and to infer gravity       fields of objects near the spacecraft.         Ground stations can record spacecraft signals that have       propagated through or been scattered from target media.       Measurements of signal parameters after wave interactions with       surfaces, atmospheres, rings, and plasmas are used to infer       physical and electrical properties of the target.         Principal investigators vary from experiment to experiment.       See the corresponding section of the spacecraft instrument       description or the data set description for specifics.         The Deep Space Network is managed by the Jet Propulsion       Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology for the       U.S.  National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

Subsystems - DSN     ================       The Deep Space Communications Complexes (DSCCs) are an integral       part of the Radio Science instrument, along with other       receiving stations and the spacecraft Radio Frequency       Subsystem.  Their system performance directly determines the       degree of success of Radio Science investigations, and their       system calibration determines the degree of accuracy in the       results of the experiments.  The following paragraphs describe       the functions performed by the individual subsystems of a DSCC.       This material has been adapted from [ASMAR&HERRERA1993]; for       additional information, consult [DSN810-5].         Each DSCC includes a set of antennas, a Signal Processing       Center (SPC), and communication links to the Jet Propulsion       Laboratory (JPL).  The general configuration is illustrated       below; antennas (Deep Space Stations, or DSS -- a term carried       over from earlier times when antennas were individually       instrumented) are listed in the table.             --------   --------   --------   --------   --------          | DSS 12 | | DSS 18 | | DSS 14 | | DSS 15 | | DSS 16 |          |34-m STD| |34-m STD| |  70-m  | |34-m HEF| |  26-m  |           --------   --------   --------   --------   --------               |            |     |             |          |               |            v     v             |          v               |           ---------            |     ---------                --------->|GOLDSTONE|<----------     |EARTH/ORB|                          | SPC  10 |<-------------->|   LINK  |                           ---------                  ---------                          |   SPC   |<-------------->|   26-M  |                          |  COMM   |         ------>|   COMM  |                           ---------         |        ---------                               |             |            |                               v             |            v              ------       ---------         |        ---------             | NOCC |<--->|   JPL   |<-------        |         |              ------      | CENTRAL |                |   GSFC  |              ------      |   COMM  |                | NASCOMM |             | MCCC |<--->| TERMINAL|<-------------->|         |              ------       ---------                  ---------                                                       ^     ^                                                       |     |                    CANBERRA (SPC 40) <----------------      |                                                             |                      MADRID (SPC 60) <----------------------                             GOLDSTONE     CANBERRA      MADRID              Antenna        SPC 10       SPC 40       SPC 60             --------      ---------     --------     --------             26-m            DSS 16       DSS 46       DSS 66             34-m STD        DSS 12       DSS 42       DSS 61                             DSS 18       DSS 48       DSS 68             34-m HEF        DSS 15       DSS 45       DSS 65             70-m            DSS 14       DSS 43       DSS 63             Developmental   DSS 13           Subsystem interconnections at each DSCC are shown in the       diagram below, and they are described in the sections that       follow.

The DMC is the center of activity at a DSCC.  The         DMC receives and archives most of the information from the         NOCC needed by the various DSCC subsystems during their         operation.  Control of most of the DSCC subsystems, as well         as the handling and displaying of any responses to control         directives and configuration and status information received         from each of the subsystems, is done through the DMC.  The         effect of this is to centralize the control, display, and         archiving functions necessary to operate a DSCC.         Communication between the various subsystems is done using a         Local Area Network (LAN) hooked up to each subsystem via a         network interface unit (NIU).           DMC operations are divided into two separate areas: the         Complex Monitor and Control (CMC) and the Link Monitor and         Control (LMC).  The primary purpose of the CMC processor for         Radio Science support is to receive and store all predict         sets transmitted from NOCC such as Radio Science, antenna         pointing, tracking, receiver, and uplink predict sets and         then, at a later time, to distribute them to the appropriate         subsystems via the LAN.  Those predict sets can be stored in         the CMC for a maximum of three days under normal conditions.         The CMC also receives, processes, and displays event/alarm         messages; maintains an operator log; and produces tape labels         for the DSP.  Assignment and configuration of the LMCs is         done through the CMC; to a limited degree the CMC can perform         some of the functions performed by the LMC.  There are two         CMCs (one on-line and one backup) and three LMCs at each DSCC         The backup CMC can function as an additional LMC if         necessary.           The LMC processor provides the operator interface for monitor         and control of a link -- a group of equipment required to         support a spacecraft pass.  For Radio Science, a link might         include the DSCC Spectrum Processing Subsystem (DSP) (which,         in turn, can control the SSI), or the Tracking Subsystem.         The LMC also maintains an operator log which includes         operator directives and subsystem responses.  One important         Radio Science specific function that the LMC performs is         receipt and transmission of the system temperature and signal         level data from the PPM for display at the LMC console and         for inclusion in Monitor blocks.  These blocks are recorded         on magnetic tape as well as appearing in the Mission Control         and Computing Center (MCCC) displays.  The LMC is required to         operate without interruption for the duration of the Radio         Science data acquisition period.           The Area Routing Assembly (ARA), which is part of the Digital         Communications Subsystem, controls all data communication         between the stations and JPL.  The ARA receives all required         data and status messages from the LMC/CMC and can record them         to tape as well as transmit them to JPL via data lines.  The         ARA also receives predicts and other data from JPL and passes         them on to the CMC.           DSCC Antenna Mechanical Subsystem       ---------------------------------         Multi-mission Radio Science activities require support from         the 70-m, 34-m HEF, and 34-m STD antenna subnets.  The         antennas at each DSCC function as large-aperture collectors         which, by double reflection, cause the incoming radio         frequency (RF) energy to enter the feed horns.  The large         collecting surface of the antenna focuses the incoming energy         onto a subreflector, which is adjustable in both axial and         angular position.  These adjustments are made to correct for         gravitational deformation of the antenna as it moves between         zenith and the horizon; the deformation can be as large as         5 cm.  The subreflector adjustments optimize the channeling         of energy from the primary reflector to the subreflector         and then to the feed horns.  The 70-m and 34-m HEF antennas         have 'shaped' primary and secondary reflectors, with forms         that are modified paraboloids.  This customization allows         more uniform illumination of one reflector by another.  The         34-m STD primary reflectors are classical paraboloids, while         the subreflectors are standard hyperboloids.           On the 70-m and 34-m STD antennas, the subreflector directs         received energy from the antenna onto a dichroic plate, a         device which reflects S-band energy to the S-band feed horn         and passes X-band energy through to the X-band feed horn.  In         the 34-m HEF, there is one 'common aperture feed,' which         accepts both frequencies without requiring a dichroic plate.         RF energy to be transmitted into space by the horns is         focused by the reflectors into narrow cylindrical beams,         pointed with high precision (either to the dichroic plate or         directly to the subreflector) by a series of drive motors and         gear trains that can rotate the movable components and their         support structures.           The different antennas can be pointed by several means.  Two         pointing modes commonly used during tracking passes are         CONSCAN and 'blind pointing.' With CONSCAN enabled and a         closed loop receiver locked to a spacecraft signal, the         system tracks the radio source by conically scanning around         its position in the sky.  Pointing angle adjustments are         computed from signal strength information (feedback) supplied         by the receiver.  In this mode the Antenna Pointing Assembly         (APA) generates a circular scan pattern which is sent to the         Antenna Control System (ACS).  The ACS adds the scan pattern         to the corrected pointing angle predicts.  Software in the         receiver-exciter controller computes the received signal         level and sends it to the APA.  The correlation of scan         position with the received signal level variations allows the         APA to compute offset changes which are sent to the ACS.         Thus, within the capability of the closed-loop control         system, the scan center is pointed precisely at the apparent         direction of the spacecraft signal source.  An additional         function of the APA is to provide antenna position angles and         residuals, antenna control mode/status information, and         predict-correction parameters to the Area Routing Assembly         (ARA) via the LAN, which then sends this information to JPL         via the Ground Communications Facility (GCF) for antenna         status monitoring.           During periods when excessive signal level dynamics or low         received signal levels are expected (e.g., during an         occultation experiment), CONSCAN should not be used.  Under         these conditions, blind pointing (CONSCAN OFF) is used, and         pointing angle adjustments are based on a predetermined         Systematic Error Correction (SEC) model.           Independent of CONSCAN state, subreflector motion in at least         the z-axis may introduce phase variations into the received         Radio Science data.  For that reason, during certain         experiments, the subreflector in the 70-m and 34-m HEFs may         be frozen in the z-axis at a position (often based on         elevation angle) selected to minimize phase change and signal         degradation.  This can be done via Operator Control Inputs         (OCIs) from the LMC to the Subreflector Controller (SRC)         which resides in the alidade room of the antennas.  The SRC         passes the commands to motors that drive the subreflector to         the desired position.  Unlike the 70-m and 34-m HEFs which         have azimuth-elevation (AZ-EL) drives, the 34-m STD antennas         use (hour angle-declination) HA-DEC drives.  The same         positioning of the subreflector on the 34-m STD does not         create the same effect as on the 70-m and 34-m HEFs.           Pointing angles for all three antenna types are computed by         the NOCC Support System (NSS) from an ephemeris provided by         the flight project.  These predicts are received and archived         by the CMC.  Before each track, they are transferred to the         APA, which transforms the direction cosines of the predicts         into AZ-EL coordinates for the 70-m and 34-m HEFs or into         HA-DEC coordinates for the 34-m STD antennas.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:clem1.uvvis,ULTRAVIOLET/VISIBLE CAMERA for CLEM1,ULTRAVIOLET/VISIBLE CAMERA,"               Online Reference: http://wundow.wustl.edu/clbin/clsearch.pl        Instrument Overview     ===================       The Ultraviolet/Visible Camera (UVVIS) has a catadioptic       telescope using fused silica lenses focused onto a       metachrome-coated charge couple device (CCD) imager.  Active       wavelength response is limited on the short wavelength end by       the transmission of fused silica and the optical blur of the       lens.  Wavelength response on the long end is limited by the       response of the CCD.  Six spectral bands can be selected from a       filter wheel which is controlled through the same       serial-addressable synchronous interface (SASI).         The Thomson focal plane array (FPA) used is a frame-transfer       device, accomplishing electronic shuttering by rapidly shifting       the active pixel area into the storage area, pausing for the       13-bit programmable shuttering system integration time, then       rapidly shifting the captured image into a storage buffer from       which the image is read out.  Post-FPA electronics allow three       gain states followed by 5 bits of offset that span 248 counts       in the analog regime to augment the basic 8-bit analog/digital       (A/D) conversion.  Gain is A/D digitization noise limited, so       proper exposure is critical.         Working against the day side of the Moon as a target, typical       integration times were as short as several milliseconds in the       lowest gain state (1000 electrons/bit) near sub-solar       illumination points at the brighter spectral bands, increasing       to 40 msec near the polar regions in the mid-gain setting for       the weaker 415 and 1000 nanometers (nm) spectral bands.  The       UVVIS performance specifications are shown below.       Scientific Objectives     =====================       The primary scientific objective of the UVVIS imaging       instrument was to support lunar mineral mapping investigations.       Pole-to-pole NADIR observations with solar phase angles kept to       less than 30 degrees at mid-latitudes were the predominant       viewing conditions during the two month systematic mapping       phase of the mission.  The UVVIS and NIR cameras provided 100%       coverage of the lunar surface in 11 spectral bands ranging in       wavelength from 415 to 2690 nm.  Image resolution ranges from       100 meters/pixel at periselene (-28 degrees south latitude for       the first month's observations, +28 degrees the second month)       to 400 meters/pixel at the poles.       Calibration     ===========       The radiometric calibration converts the digitized signal       received from the camera (DN value) into a quantity that is       proportional to the radiance reaching the sensor.  The       sensitivity of the CCD focal plane array varies across the       field of view but appears to be time invariant during the two       month lunar observation period.  The UVVIS camera was       calibrated before launch.  Laboratory observations of a flat       field under various operating temperatures and camera operation       modes provides information about the sensitivity of the camera       under expected spaceflight conditions.  During inflight       operations, a variety of calibration observations were made       including images of stars with known radiance (Vega) and the       Apollo Landing sites where laboratory spectra of returned lunar       samples have been measured.         Geometric calibration removes optical distortions of the       imaging system.  The geometric distortion of the UVVIS camera       has been shown to be minimal (maximum optical distortion does       not exceed 0.1 pixels) and can be satisfactorily modeled by a       radially dependent 2nd order polynomial.         For additional information on the geometric and radiometric       calibration of the Clementine imaging systems, contact the PDS       Imaging Node.         Operational Considerations     ==========================       The pole-to-pole lunar observations provided scenes with a       broad range of viewing conditions, ranging from bright       observations near zero phase angle at the equator to very low       light-level observations at the poles.  In order to properly       record an observation with an optimal signal-to-noise ratio it       is important to adequately fill the 8-bit (255 levels) dynamic       range of the A/D camera output.  The integration time (exposure       time) and the gain and offset settings of the instrument were       adjusted to properly record each image.  During the systematic       mapping, the gain state of the camera was normally set to 1 for       the mid-latitude observations and set to 2 (thereby increasing       the sensitivity of the A/D converter) at the higher latitudes.       Integration times were increased as observations approached the       poles.  Lunar observations were broken into 10 latitude bins.       Each latitude bin contained fixed gain and offset modes and       integration times for each camera/filter combination.         For the UVVIS camera two observations were made in rapid       succession acquiring both high and low integration-time images       for the same scene.  The multiple integration-time imaging was       designed to optimally record both maria materials (dark albedo       material optimally recorded by the high integration-time image)       and highland materials (high albedo materials optimally       recorded by the low integration-time image).         The Clementine orbit was designed to provide overlapping       coverage in both the down-track (~15% overlap) and cross-track       (~10% overlap at the equator) directions.  The image overlap is       necessary to geometrically control images in cartographic       applications.         Operational Modes     =================       The UVVIS camera had three operating modes:         1.  13-bit programmable integration time.  The range of       integration times (in microseconds) is given by: Integration       Time = [(N+3)*94.5 - 45, N=0,2,3...2**13)].         2.  Gain Mode.  The gain mode represents the multiplicative       constant applied to the image data passing through the A/D       converter.  Three gain state settings were available (1,2,4)       although gain setting 4 was seldom used during lunar       observations.         3.  Offset Mode.  The offset mode represents the additive       constant applied to the image data passing through the A/D       converter.  There were 14 offset mode settings (1-14) although       offset modes 1 and 6 were predominantly used during systematic       lunar observations.

Lunar surface environments              present a greater radiation risk to the astronaut than Low Earth Orbit (LEO). There are two sources              of radiation risk for lunar surface environments. The first source of risk is the total radiation              dose from Galactic Cosmic Rays, which is about twice as high on the lunar surface as in LEO. The              second source of risk is from space weather events resulting from solar activity. The Linear Energy              Transfer Spectrometer (LETS) is a radiation monitor that is derived from heritage hardware flown              on Orion EFT-1 and slated to fly on the Orion EM-1 mission that will enable acquisition of knowledge              of the lunar radiation environment and demonstrate the capabilities of a system on the lunar surface.

A key determinant of leakage flux in the epithermal energy range (>0.5 eV – 500 keV) is abundance of              hydrogen-bearing compounds. NSS gauges the fluxes of neutrons in two energy ranges: a) thermal neutrons, less than 0.5 eV,              which respond to both abundance and burial depth of hydrogenous materials, and b) epithermal neutrons, which vary in a              different way with hydrogen abundance and burial depth from the thermal neutron population.  Together, these two measurements              constrain not only water-equivalent hydrogen (WEH) abundance but permit a simple model of stratigraphy (burial depth and              lower-layer WEH abundance, assuming the overburden is hydrogen-free). Water-equivalent hydrogen is the weight percent of              water that a material would contain if all the detected hydrogen was in the form of H2O. For example, a material containing              1500 ppm H would have a water-equivalent hydrogen content of 1.35 wt.%.                          NSS consists of gas-proportional counter neutron detectors with a design based on the Lunar Prospector Neutron Spectrometer.              NSS will measure any temporal variations of at least 0.5 wt.% water-equivalent hydrogen (WEH) at the lander's location. NSS              measurements are also used to infer the probable burial depth and WEH wt.% of a buried layer below otherwise desiccated              regolith.

Previous missions have demonstrated the presence              of volatiles at the lunar surface, but significant questions remain about the where those volatiles came from              and how they are transported across the lunar surface. Investigating how the lunar exosphere changes over the              course of a lunar day can provide insight into the transport process for volatiles on the Moon. The instrument              has the ability to measure the low level of gases expected in the lunar exosphere and released by regolith              interaction with surface disturbances, like rovers.             The PITMS sensor has direct heritage from the Ptolemy mass spectrometer that made the first in situ measurements              of volatiles and organics on comet 67P with the Rosetta lander, Philae. PITMS operates in a passive sampling mode,              where molecules fall into the zenith-facing aperture and are trapped by a radiofrequency field, then sequentially              released for analysis. PITMS has a unit mass resolution up to an upper mass-to-charge (m/z) limit of 150 Da.             The PITMS investigation will provide time-resolved variability of OH, H2O, noble gases, nitrogen, and sodium              compounds released from the soil and present in the exosphere over the course of a lunar day. PITMS is a joint              NASA-ESA project implemented by NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) and ESA’s contractors Open University              (OU) and STFC RAL Space, with coordination and support provided by ESA’s Space Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC).

Its main functions are:       *         to locate the target comet against the star background days to weeks before an encounter     *         to take color images of the nucleus, any gas or dust jets, and other features in the inner coma     *         to image the inner coma in wavelengths sensitive to major species of ionized gas                  CFI Vital Statistics   Telescope aperture       60 mm Telescope focal length   300 mm Field-of-view            2.5deg x 2.5deg Pixel field-of-view      43 mrad (0.002deg) Wavelength range         308-920 nm Spectral channels        10 Detector type            Marconi 47-20 Pixels per image         1024 x 1024 Typical exposure times   90 ms to 10 sec     CFI is optimized for low-light and short-wavelength imaging of a comet during CONTOUR's approach to it, including early detection for optical navigation, imaging of the coma, and imaging of emissions from ionized gases.   CFI's reflective telescope focuses light through one of ten selectable filters mounted in a filter wheel, of which one is for broadband ('clear' filter) optical navigation images, three are for imaging in narrow wavelength bands emitted by ionized gases in the coma, and six are for multispectral imaging of the nucleus and coma. The digital image is captured by a high-efficiency, back-illuminated charge-coupled device (CCD) manufactured by Marconi. This is similar to the detector used in a standard video camera, except that CFIs CCD is black and white only (with color obtained using different filters) and it is manufactured to achieve higher sensitivity especially at ultraviolet wavelengths (as short as 308 nm for coma emission band imaging). The field of view is 2.5deg x 2.5deg, 1024 x 1024 pixels.   Instead of looking directly at a comet and into the oncoming stream of impacting dust, CFI's telescope looks at one of four mirrors mounted onto the side of a rotatable cube. Only one mirror is exposed at a time to the oncoming dust, and a fresh mirror is put in place before each comet encounter by rotating the cube. The most important CFI measurements at each comet are for optical navigation and broad scale nucleus/coma imaging, and these are made at distances of tens to hundreds of thousands of kilometers before the mirror could be seriously damaged by oncoming dust particles.

During the days before the enounter, every six hours a group of clear-filter images will be taken for spacecraft navigation and downlinked to Earth. These show the comet's position against a background of stars as dim as 11th magnitude, and will be analyzed to refine targeting of the encounter. Science imaging of the coma begins 5 hours before closest approach to the nucleus, with regular monitoring of activity in the inner coma. The prime CFI science imaging begins only six minutes out and continues through about 70 seconds before closest approach, with detailed imaging of the inner coma and color imaging of the nucleus. The narrow emission band filters are sensitive to hydroxyl (OH) from dissociated water and to cyanide and carbon (CN and C2) from dissociated dust, and will show the locations of jets of gas and dust driven off the nucleus by sublimating ices. The last color images will show details on the nucleus surface as small as 85 meters across. After this, the nucleus passes out of CFI's field-of-view and is no longer observable.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:con.crispimag,CONTOUR REMOTE IMAGING SPECTROGRAPH - IMAGER for CON,CONTOUR REMOTE IMAGING SPECTROGRAPH - IMAGER,"   CONTOUR Remote Imaging Spectrograph - Imager (CRISPIMAG)   The CRISP instrument is effectively two instruments working independently in a single package.  For that reason the same description is supplied for both the imager (CRISPIMAG) and the spectrograph (CRISPSPEC).   Instrument Overview =================== CRISP actively tracks the comet's nucleus near CONTOUR's closest approach, taking high resolution images, color images through 10 filters, and an infrared spectral map.     Once light enters the reflective telescope, wavelengths shorter than 800 nm are reflected by a beamsplitter to an imager. The imager has a 10-position filter wheel, with one filter for fast, clear- filter imaging and nine filters for measuring color differences indicative of differences in composition of the non-ice portion of the nucleus surface. The digital image is captured by a CCD that provides a field-of-view 1.2deg x 1.2deg (1024 x 1024 pixels). Infrared light at wavelengths beyond 800 nm is sent through a narrow slit into the spectrometer part of CRISP. The slit forms an image of a long, narrow portion of the nucleus. This long, narrow image is dispersed by the spectrometer into 256 different near-infrared wavelengths from 800 nm to 2500 nm. In the resulting two- dimensional image, which is measured by a Rockwell mercury-cadmium telluride (HgCdTe) detector cooled cryogenically to 90degK, one direction corresponds to spatial location along the slit and the other direction corresponds to wavelength of light.     CRISP's scan mirror is the critical component that allows the instrument to take high-resolution images (as good as 4 meters per pixel) while passing as close as 100 kilometers from its target at high velocity. The imager and spectrometer both 'look' at a scan mirror. The mirror steers the fields-of-view to track the comet nucleus and take out its relative motion so that unsmeared images can be obtained. The tracking process begins about 10,000 km before closest approach, when the comet is only a few tens of pixels across. At this point the field-of-view is still large compared to navigational uncertainties, so it can be pointed at the comet's position and be assured of capturing the comet. Image processing in CRISP's Data Processing Unit (DPU) autonomously calculates the center of the illuminated part of the nucleus, and keeps track of the location of that point in subsequent images. This series of measurements is used by a program in the DPU that extrapolates into the future where it expects the nucleus to be, and then compares the prediction with the actual position from the image processing software. Both procedures progressively refine the estimated location of the nucleus as a function of time before closest approach. By the time the critical close- up data are taken, a preprogrammed set of observations is matched with the actual flyby time to better than 1 second. The updated three-dimensional estimate of the nucleus's location is used to point the mirror, keep the nucleus in the center of the field-of-view, and take out smear. This approach requires that CRISP's line-of-sight is accurately referenced into inertial coordinates. As a result the spacecraft star cameras, which provide the inertial reference for spacecraft pointing, are mounted directly to CRISP instead of to the spacecraft.   At the Encke encounter, in the hours prior to one hour before closest approach, CONTOUR is occasionally tilted by a few degrees so that CRISP can monitor the distant nucleus's rotation unobstructed by the dust shield. Subsequently, the dust shield is oriented to protect the body of the spacecraft from impacts by dust in the comet's coma. Beginning about 6 minutes prior to closest approach, image acquisition is begun at a high rate so that the nucleus' position can be determined and tracked. During this time CRISP's aperture is partly occulted by the edge of the dust shield. CRISP's main period of data acquisition begins only about 50 seconds before closest approach when the dust shield no longer interferes with the view of the nucleus. The mirror keeps the nucleus in the field-of-view and scans the spectrometer slit across the surface, building up an infrared compositional map showing features as small as about 100 meters across. Color images taken by the imager show variations at scales three times smaller. Then a series of clear-filter images is taken as the spacecraft's changing view of the nucleus provides a stereo perspective. The mirror continues tracking the nucleus until it is 30 degrees off the forward direction, about 6 seconds before closest approach, when the highest-resolution images (about 4 meters per pixel) are obtained. Outbound from a comet, the sequence will be repeated in reverse.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:con.ngims,NEUTRAL GAS AND ION MASS SPECTROMETER for CON,NEUTRAL GAS AND ION MASS SPECTROMETER,"   CONTOUR Neutral Gas and Ion Mass Spectrometer (NGIMS)   The Neutral Gas and Ion Mass Spectrometer will measure the abundance and isotope ratios for many neutral and ion species in the coma of each comet during the flyby. These measure- ments together with data from the dust experiment will contribute to the understanding of the chemi- cal composition of the nucleus itself and allow differences between the comets to be studied. NIGMS is a quadrupole mass spectrometer that employs two ion sources each optimized for a specific set of measurements. Using these two sources, NGIMS will rapidly switch between measurements of the cometary neutral gas and ambient ions from the coma as the CONTOUR spacecraft flys by the nucleus. Understanding the chemical state of comets is expected to provide the best possible record of conditions present in the outer solar nebula early in its history, since the comet nuclei of comets likely contains primitive materials unaltered by the chemical and physical processes that have trans- formed other solar system objects.     Science Objectives of NGIMS   The chemical composition measurements of NGIMS are expected to provide an understanding of the relative abundances of simple species such as H 2 O, CH 4 , CO 2 , NH 3 , and H 2 S and considerably more complex molecules in the early stages of the protosolar nebula. Since comets have been in cold storage since their formation, this record is ex- pected to be largely preserved. Cometary infall contributes volatile species to the planets including the atmosphere and oceans of the Earth and the chemi- cal complexity of this material from space can be understood through the NGIMS data. Another scientific goal is to clarify the relationship of the solar nebula to the parent inter- stellar cloud. A key to each of these scientific objectives is the measurement of isotope ratios such as D/H and the abundance of 'thermometer' gases in comets such as argon and other simple species. The history of the chemical and physical processing of the nucleus material can only be understood though such a detailed study.       NGIMS Functions   Direct Gas Sampling in the Open Ion Source: The open source of the NGIMS minimizes gas/surface interaction effects by directly sampling gaseous species that are formed into a beam before the ioniza- tion region by collimating apertures. The open source measures ambient particle density directly for all neutral species.   High Sensitivity Sampling in the Closed Ion Source: The closed ion source will use RAM density enhancement to provide measurements of higher accuracy and sensitivity for the more inert atomic and molecular species than provided by the open source. The sensitivity enhancement is achieved by sam- pling the ambient gas through an orifice into an enclosed antechamber. The density enhancement in the source compared to the ambient density can be as high as several hundred depending on the flyby velocity, the molecular weight of the sampled species, and the source temperature. The closed source works best with species that do not chemically transform on the source walls.   Open Source Sampling of Thermal and Medium Energy Ions: Ion species present in the coma within the mass range of the NGIMS will be sampled through the open source. These ions are created by photoionization, electron ionization, and other processes acting on gases in the coma.   Ion Source Selection in the Quadrupole Deflector: Ions are sequentially directed to the mass analyzer from the selected ion source by changing the potentials on the quadrupole deflector. This electrostatic device allows either source of ions to be focusd into a common exit lens system.   The Quadrupole Mass Analyzer: The quadrupole mass analyzer consists of four pre- cision ground hyperbolic rods mounted in a rigid me- chanical assembly. The transmitted mass to charge value and the resolution are controlled by variations in RF and DC electric fields between adjacent rod pairs while opposite rod pairs are kept at the same potential. Three fixed frequencies (in the 1 to 5 MHz range) are selected to cover the mass range (1 to 300 amu). The Dual Detector System: The detector system counts ions transmitted through the quadrupole analyzer to pro- duce a mass spectrum. The system is redundant and con- figured for a wide dynamic range.

MRO's objectives are to recover climate science originally to have been conducted on the Mars Climate Orbiter (MCO), to identify and characterize sites of possible aqueous activity to which future landed missions may be sent, and to characterize the composition, geology, and stratigraphy of Martian surface deposits. MRO will operate from a sun-synchronous, near- circular (255x320 km altitude), near-polar orbit with a mean local solar time of 3 PM. CRISM's spectral range spans the ultraviolet (UV) to the mid-wave infrared (MWIR), 362 nm to 3920 nm. The instrument utilizes a Ritchey-Chretien telescope with a 2.12 degree field-of-view (FOV) to focus light on the entrance slit of a dual spectrometer. Within the spectrometer, light is split by a dichroic into VNIR (visible-near-infrared, 362-1053 nm) and IR (infrared, 1002-3920 nm) beams. Each beam is directed into a separate modified Offner spectrometer that focuses a spectrally dispersed image of the slit onto a two dimensional focal plane (FP). The IR FP is a 640 x 480 HgCdTe area array; the VNIR FP is a 640 x 480 silicon photodiode area array. The spectral image is contiguously sampled with a 6.55 nm spectral spacing and an instantaneous field of view of 61.5 microradians. The Optical Sensor Unit (OSU) can be gimbaled to take out along-track smear, allowing long integration times that afford high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at high spectral and spatial resolution.

Each array viewed the same region of the sky via beamsplitting dichroics. The light passed through both dichroics to the Ks-band array. The first dichroic reflection fed the light to the J-band array. All three optical paths shared the same first element located behind a cryogenic field stop. Each optical path had six other lenses. This set of six lenses was identical for each band. The lenses were composed of water-free fused silica (Infrasil) or calcium fluoride. All lens surfaces were spherical. All optical elements were anti-reflection coated and the integrated optical assembly transmitted ~70% of the incident light.

The SOAR Optical Imager (SOI) is a bent-Cassegrain mounted optical imager using a mini-mosaic of two E2V 2k x 4k CCDs to cover a 5.25 arcminute square field of view at a scale of 0.0767""/pixel. It was designed, built, and integrated at SOAR by a NOIRLab/CTIO team lead by Drs. Alistair Walker and Hugo Schwarz.  Optics: The SOI optics consist of a 6 element focal reducer and field corrector, that converts the f/16.63 beam of the SOAR Telescope to f/9.82, preceded by a linear, ""trombone style"", Atmospheric Dispersion Corrector (ADC). These optics were designed to deliver images of < 0.18 arcsec FWHM (equivalent to 80% encircled energy within D80 < 0.27 arcsec) at the zenith and <0.34 arcsec FWHM (D80 < 0.51 arcsec) at 70deg zenith distance, in each of the U, B, V, R, I broad band filters, and over the entire field. The glasses selected, and the use of SOLGEL over MgF2 coatings on all external surfaces ensure high transmission over the entire 310nm-1050nm passband.   CCDs: The SOI focal plane is imaged onto a mini-mosaic of two CCDs with charge transfer efficiency of 99.9995 and dark current of 0.01e/pix/hr.  CCD mounting gap: The two CCDs in the SOI are mounted with their long sides parallel and spaced 102 pixels apart, resulting in a 7.8"" gap between the individual CCD images. The gap can be filled by taking dithered images. We recommend taking at least 3 images with 10"" steps to produce a complete combined image with no gap.  Flat Fields and Fringing: The CCDs show fringing in the I, i' and z' bands at the 10%, 3% and 12% level, respectively. In the U band some hatched structure is seen but this flat fields out perfectly.  Ghosts, stray light etc..: The use of interference filters - which select their passband by reflecting the rest of the light - results in haloes around bright sources. These haloes look like images of the entrance pupil of the telescope with the secondary mirror spider clearly visible, especially when the seeing is good. We have some stray light from encoders in the SOI rotator on the CCDs in the I band. The level is about 0.2 ADU per second, or less than 1% of the dark sky background. We are working on eliminating this stray light.  Read-out: The chips are read out by two amplifiers each. Various read-out and binning modes will be available. Note that a seeing disk of 0.45"" is still well-sampled by 2x2 binned pixels, so that only for the very best seeing and using the tip-tilt mode should the CCDs be used in unbinned mode. At present, the tip-tilt mode is not yet offered.  SOI is no longer offered in slow read-out mode (as of 2008 Nov).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DECam is a facility instrument, available to all users. DECam was built to carry out the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Project by the DES Collaboration, which finished observations in January 2019.

The following is a report on the current status of DECam CCDs that have presented problems in the past: CCD 61 = N30 Fault: Very low full well following an over-illumination event in November 2012. Comment: This CCD is normally masked out in reduction pipelines. This failure prompted extra â€œno bright lightâ€ operations procedures for DECam, observations closer to 10 deg from the Moon are prevented, and we added extra protection photodiodes to supplement those already on the FPA. CCD 31 = S7 Fault: Amplifier B has unstable gain, from installation September 2012. Comment: Generally the whole CCD is masked out in reduction pipelines. However Amplifier A does function correctly. CCD 2 = S30 Fault: Stopped working November 2013, restarted 29 Dec 2016. Comment: It is postulated without any proof that a piece of electrically conducting debris within the Imager fell on exposed serial clock lines for this CCD, and then after three years fell off again. There are reports that the amplifier(s) are unstable at the 0.3% level so caveat emptor for critical work. CCD 46 = N15 Fault: Hot spot started 10 Nov 2017, intermittent, not seen since January 2018. Comment: The hot spot was a charge defect and did not generate light. Generally hot spots are associated with a pixel-level defect, e.g. a short in the gate structure, and are not intermittent nor do they heal themselves. So there is no explanation for why this very prominent defect disappeared, with the affected pixel (800, 2630) now looking completely normal. CCD 41 = N10 Fault: Poor serial charge transfer on amp B, started 31 August 2018, intermittent, most recent incident 20 October 2018 Comment: This was diagnosed as a fault associated with a single serial clock line (H3). All relevant external hardware (clock card, transition card, cables to VIB) has been changed, but the fault kept reappearing. It was discovered that a script which toggles vsub for all CCDs, and disables/enables the clock lines for the associated backplane (#5, 18 CCDs), fixes the fault. This could be understood if it was clearing a latched driver. CCD 44 = N13 Fault: From November 2018, appears to be a thread or similar stuck to the surface of the detector near x=1133, y=1980. FN2 and FS4 Fault: Half of each of these two F&A CCDs has low full well (10%). Comment: Diagnosed as damage to output amplifier or signal chain inside the Imager. Since installation, September 2012. FN2 Fault: Has developed a super-hot pixel (~1645, 2096), since 9 April 2015 Comment: This is on the very edge of the format.. It was previously known as a slightly hot pixel, now it is very bright, clearly visible on bias exposures. General: Every time the DECam CCDs are warmed up and cooled down again the conduction between the CCDs and their mount can change very slightly, and with it the operating temperature for the CCD relative to the average for all the others. This temperature change means that the CCD response cutoff near 1.05 microns can change slightly (warmer CCD implies redder cutoff), and this can be seen in the relative flat-field response through the Y filter, which has detector-defined red cutoff. Such changes have been seen now and then but they are always very small (no more than a 1% change in Y band throughput), although a possible 2% change for CCD 27 = S3 as a result of the 2018 March warm/cool cycle is under investigation by DES. As expected, this is a Y-band effect only. DECam Shutter -------------------- The DECam shutter is a large shutter made by Bonn Shutter and consists of two accurately-controlled blades that sweep across the focal plane, the first movement lets light to the focal plane, the second closes off the light. The length of time it takes a shutter blade to sweep across the focal plane is approximately one second. For any exposures longer than one second, the movement of the two blades is sequential, but for shorter exposures the movement of the two blades occurs simultaneously, and the two blades form a “slit” that sweeps across the focal plane. Since the blades are accurately synchronized, very short exposures (a few milliseconds} are possible. The longest exposures regularly taken, through u band or narrowband filters normally do not exceed 1200 seconds although there is no technical limitation to going longer. The number of cosmic ray events on the CCDs starts getting obnoxious for long exposure times. There are several aspects to be considered if doing short exposures of moving objects, or very rapid variables. Firstly, the the blades move in the East-West direction. Blade “A” is on the west side and Blade “B” is on the east side. So for an exposure assume Blade A covers the focal plane. It then moves to the west position and so the exposure starts, then at the end of the exposure Blade B moves from its east position to cover the focal plane. The following exposure reverses the direction the blades move, and so on. Unfortunately, which of the two situations (blades moving to the east or to the west) applies to any given exposure is NOT written into the image header or to the SISPI log. It is however in the low level PanView log. Since one only needs to know which of the two situations you have for one “fiducial” exposure in a given night, that information can easily be provided upon request. Secondly, the actual epoch at which the shutter opens for a given CCD pixel depends on where that pixel is situated. The time for the blade to sweep across the focal plan is approximately one second, so this effect could be of importancce for short exposure times. Thirdly, the shutter is sited, along with the filters, between corrector elements C3 and C4, a long way from the focal plane. Photons falling on a given pixel are contained in a cone that is some 20 cm diameter by the time it passes through the shutter. And finally, the shutter control is not hardware-synced to the CCD readout. The complications that might be relevant for short exposures of moving objects, or rapid variables, are likely to be irrelevant for the great majority of DECam programs. The following outstanding specifications mean that very few people need worry about any shutter-related effects on their photometry, and indeed the shutter performance far exceeds the DECam design specifications in all respects. Minimum recommended shutter time: 100 msec (non-uniformity is then < 1% over the whole focal plane) Maximum recommended shutter time: 1800 sec (but beware cosmic rays) Minimum allowed shutter time: 10 msec Exposure time uniformity: < 1 msec Exposure time repeatability: << 1msec Exposure time accuracy: << 1 msec Absolute timing: < 1 msec ( internal to the shutter, but the external error in the absolute timing is very much larger due to external connections) Note these specifications are those demonstrated at the factory at time of acceptance in 2011. Most of these specifications we have no way of testing to the required accuracy with DECam on the Blanco telescope.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:dawn.fc1,Framing Camera 1,Framing Camera 1,"Instrument Overview ===================  The Framing Camera (FC) is a multispectral CCD imager in a refracting telescope that also serves as optical navigation camera for the NASA Dawn mission to the asteroids 4 Vesta and 1 Ceres. The camera consists of two identical units, FC1 and FC2, which are mounted side-by-side on the +Z deck of the spacecraft. The instrument uses a re-closable front door to protect the optical system and commands eight filters in a wheel, one clear and seven narrow-band. The instrument hardware and scientific objectives are documented in [SIERKSETAL2011].  Scientific Objectives =====================  The FC science objectives at Vesta and Ceres are to  - Determine the asteroid's origin and evolution  - Determine shape and volume  - Measure the spin rate and pole position  - Map the topography  - Map the basic mineralogical composition  - Determine the regolith properties through photometric analysis and search for evidence of regolith transport  - Study crater morphology and distribution  - Age determination of the surfaces  - Search for fractures and evidence of volcanism  - Study the dust environment  - Search for moons and determine their properties  - Provide a context for the HED meteorites and enable identification of possible meteorites from Ceres  To this end the FC images will be used to create global topography, albedo, and color maps, determine the surface Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function, and search for orbiting dust and moons. Through the radio science experiment it will be possible to determine the gravity field and density of the asteroids.  Calibration ===========  The FC has been calibrated using the results of laboratory and in-flight measurements. The lab measurements were acquired at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research (MPS), and were aimed at determining dark current and the absolute photometric response in each of the filters. Flat fields were acquired by imaging the inside of an integrating sphere. The in-flight measurements, acquired during the Initial Check-Out campaign in the months after launch, focused on characterizing the dark current and geometric distortion (through observation of star fields), and validating the lab radiometric calibration (photometric standard stars). The calibration pipeline is described by [SCHROEDER&GUTIER2011].  Dark current, and the associated emergence of bad pixels, and the amount of geometric distortion will continue to be monitored during semi-annual check-outs. A better understanding of the FC flat field response and in-field stray light characteristics may require recalibrating of image data in the future.  The FC harbors a calibration lamp to monitor camera performance during flight. The calibration lamp is a set of six AlGaInP light emitting diodes attached to the top flange of the objective barrel. When powered on they illuminate the inner face of the front door through a sequence of pulses on the 5.2 V line. The diode spectrum peaks at approximately 635 nm, with half maxima at 614 and 660 nm. Command parameters available to control the illumination are illumination time, offset with respect to imaging start time, pulse frequency, and duty cycle.  Operational Considerations ==========================  To ensure the safe operation of the FC, the following operational guidelines and constraints have been defined in the form of flight rules. In principle, these rules can be waived under given circumstances, following a justified request by the instrument team, and with the agreement of the mission team.  To avoid contamination of the optical system, the FC front door is kept closed during IPS thrusting, from Earth to Vesta approach, and following Vesta departure to Ceres approach. This rule does not apply during orbit transfers or maintenance maneuvers. As a precaution in case of the filter wheel of one camera getting stuck on a colored filter, the inactive camera is kept in clear filter to ensure that OpNav images (which are mission critical) can be acquired after such a failure. Additionally, only one camera is powered at any given time. To ensure an adequate thermal environment for the camera there are two additional rules. First, the Sun is kept away from the radiator prior to, and during, the operational phases to reduce thermal noise to a minimum in the sensor. Second, the Sun is kept low above the instrument deck to prevent overheating of the electronic box. However, this rule expires once the critical heliocentric range (2.1 AU) is exceeded. Finally, to avoid damage to the CCD, Sunlight is not allowed to enter the baffle at an angle lower than 20 degrees.    There are several considerations related to image acquisitions. The size of the FC mass memory is 1 GB and can store around 435 uncompressed full frame images of 2.2 MB each. Assuming an achievable lossless compression ratio of 1.8, this number grows to approximately 780 images, a number that will be higher for higher compression ratios. The maximum image acquisition rate is approximately 1 image every 3.5 seconds, plus the applicable exposure time, when no filter wheel changes are required. This time is needed for memory allocation, readout of the CCD and, writing the image data to memory. For image acquisitions involving filter changes 3 additional seconds should be allowed to ensure safe mechanism handling. Finally, the number of commands the FC can process is restricted to one per second. So when commanding several image acquisitions as individual commands, one additional second has to be allowed. Concerning the onboard processing of the images, the typical duration is around 70 seconds for a compression ratio of 2. Lower compression ratios will take longer to process (more data to be output). With respect to transmission to the spacecraft, the assigned 151 kbps data rate results in typical transmission times of 60 seconds for images compressed by factor 2.  Detectors =========  The FC detector is an Atmel/Thomson (now E2V) TH7888A front-side illuminated frame-transfer CCD. This device is designed with a 1024x1024 pixel active area and an equally sized storage area, which is covered by an optically opaque aluminum mask. The CCD makes use of a lateral anti-blooming gate structure, which prevents photo-generated charge from overexposed regions from spilling over across the columns. This additional structure is insensitive to light, so that the sensitive to total area ratio (fill factor) of a 14 micrometer sized pixel is reduced. The front-side illuminated architecture with semitransparent layers on the detector substrate further decreases the effective fill factor to about 40%, with a peak quantum efficiency of the detector at around 20%. The CCD also contains extra columns and lines that are optically masked. These areas provide reference values for bias and dark current.  The exposure time is coded in exponential form with base 10, where 3 bits specify the exponent and 7 bits identify the mantissa. Exposure duration can be set between 1 msec and about 3.5 h. After an exposure the charge accumulated in the CCD active area is rapidly shifted into the storage area, with a shift time of 1.32 msec. Subsequently, the charge is clocked out row-by-row into the horizontal serial register and then serially shifted to the output amplifier. The readout is clocked at one megapixel/sec, which results in a readout time of about 1.2 s.  The pixel charge is conditioned by correlated double sampling (CDS) circuitry, and digitized to 14-bit depth. The electronic gain of the analog chain is about 18 electrons/DN at operational temperatures. When not exposing or reading out, the FEE is in idle mode and accumulated charge is continuously erased by simultaneously shifting the parallel and serial registers.  Electronics ===========  The CCD controller is implemented in a field programmable gate array (FPGA), manufactured by Actel. It generates the timing waveforms necessary for the CCD charge shift and readout, for the CDS and for the exposure. It also supervises the data transfer to the DPU by implementing a high speed serial protocol. In addition to the nominal imaging operation, the CCD controller provides a number of engineering acquisition modes: a synthetic test pattern image, a serial readout which reads the serial register without line shift, a storage readout which reads an image without the frame transfer, and a crop mode where only the image area of 1024x1024 pixels is transmitted to the DPU.  Filters =======  The FC has 8 filters at its disposal, numbered F1 to F8. F1 is a broadband (clear) filter, sensitive in the wavelength interval from 400 to 1100 nm, peaking at 700 nm. The narrow-band color filters are of the interference type, and were constructed by multilayer, thin film deposition on front and back surfaces of silica (Suprasil) substrates. The filters are located in a wheel, and each measure 20 mm by 20 mm with varying thickness. Their effective wavelengths are (FWHM in brackets):  F2: 555 nm (+15, -28) F3: 749 nm (+22, -22) F4: 917 nm (+24, -21) F5: 965 nm (+56, -29) F6: 829 nm (+18, -18) F7: 653 nm (+18, -24) F8: 438 nm (+10, -30)  The effective wavelength is calculated as the integrated product of wavelength and responsivity divided by the integrated responsivity, with the integration performed over the filter passband.  Optics ======  The FC has a telecentric four-lens design. To maintain a fixed focal length under changing temperature, the two central lenses are mounted in an inner barrel with a different thermal expansion coefficient than the main barrel. The resulting differential movement with changing temperature maintains the focal plane location constant within 30 um. The chromatic variation of the focal plane was compensated for by varying the filter thickness per filter. Chromatic aberration was compensated for by the choice of glasses for the lenses. The optical design required an adequate back focal length to accommodate the filter wheel mechanism inside the camera head, between the lens system and the CCD. The design was optimized to ensure minimal geometric distortion (<0.1%). The following optics parameters apply to both units:  ---------------------------------- parameter                    FC ---------------------------------- Focal Length (mm)          150.0 Aperture (mm)               19.9 f/ratio                      f/8 IFOV (microrad/pixel)       93.3 Field of view (degree)     Cross-track              5.46     Along-track              5.46 ----------------------------------  Location ========  The FC is mounted on the +Z deck of the spacecraft, and has the following layout of the FOV :                                    ^ +Xfc1 (down-track)                                   | +Xfc2                                   |        ---              +---------|---------+         ^               |         |         |         |               |         |         |         |               |         |         |         |               |         |         |         |5.46 deg  1024 |         x-------------> +Yfc1 (cross-track)         |         lines |       +Zfc1       |     +Yfc2         |               |       +Zfc2       |         |               |                   |         V             Pixel                 |        ---            (0,0)-----------------+                           1024 pixels/line                          |      5.46 deg     |      Boresight (+Z axis)                         |<----------------->|       is into the page                         |                   |  Measured Parameters ===================  The FC measures radiance. The raw data numbers (DN) are converted to physical units through the radiometric calibration step in the calibration pipeline. The units associated with the calibrated Level 1b images are [W / m^2 / nm / sr] for the color filters (F2-F8) and [W / m^2 / sr] for the clear filter (F1).  Data Compression ================  Two wavelet compression algorithms are available on board to reduce the image data volume: LIFT (either 16 or 32-bit) and TAP (32-bit). Three parameters control the outcome of the compression step: - The compression flag determines if a frame is to be compressed or not. The allowed values are 'Compress' and 'Do not compress'. - The compression algorithm ID determines which filtering algorithm is used. Allowed values are 16-bit LIFT, 32-bit LIFT and 32-bit TAP. - The compression ratio establishes how strongly compressed the image will be. It is defined as the ratio between the original data volume and the compressed volume, and is encoded as a 7-bit mantissa and 1 bit for units or tenths. Allowed values are 1 to 127.  The requested compression ratio is the minimum value that can be achieved, If the compression algorithm finds a particular frame can be compressed with higher efficiency than requested, it will do so. A requested ratio of 1 is equivalent to requesting lossless compression. Only LIFT can compress truly lossless. 'Lossless' TAP leads to artifacts of at most 1 DN. Lossy TAP preserves the original image much better than lossy LIFT. Lossy TAP compression leads to a smoothing of the data, producing absolute image artifacts that are bigger for the bright areas than for the dark areas, similar to the behavior of photon noise. Consequently, at relatively low compression ratios TAP effectively smoothes photon noise. A well exposed image of Vesta is expected to compress losslessly with a ratio of about 1.8.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:dif.rss,RADIO SCIENCE SUBSYSTEM for DIF,RADIO SCIENCE SUBSYSTEM,"         Instrument Overview     ===================       The DI comet Tempel 1 flyby Radio Science investigations       utilized instrumentation with elements on the spacecraft       and at the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN).  Much of this       was shared equipment, being used for routine telecommunications       as well as for Radio Science.  The performance and calibration       of both the spacecraft and tracking stations directly affected       the radio science data accuracy, and they played a major role       in determining the quality of the results.  The spacecraft part       of the radio science instrument is described immediately below;       that is followed by a description of the DSN (ground) part of       the instrument.         Instrument Specifications - Spacecraft     ======================================       The DI comet Tempel 1 flyby spacecraft telecommunications       subsystem served as part of a radio science subsystem for       investigations of Tempel 1.  Many details of the subsystem       are unknown; its 'build date' is taken to be 1995-02-01,       the date on which acceptance testing began at Ball.           Instrument Id                  : RSS       Instrument Host Id             : DI       Pi Pds User Id                 : UNK       Instrument Name                : RADIO SCIENCE SUBSYSTEM       Instrument Type                : RADIO SCIENCE       Build Date                     : 1995-02-01       Instrument Mass                : UNK       Instrument Length              : UNK       Instrument Width               : UNK       Instrument Height              : UNK       Instrument Manufacturer Name   : Motorola           Instrument Overview - Spacecraft     ================================       The DI flyby spacecraft radio system operates at X-band       through the DSN 34 m (BWG) and 70 m nets to receive commands,       downlink telemetry and provide tracking for navigation.  There       are two low, and one high gain X-band antennas, two small       deep-space transponders and a pair of 20W TWTA power amplifiers.           The X-band capability reduced plasma effects on radio       signals by a factor of 10 compared with previous S-band       systems, but absence of a dual-frequency capability (both       S- and X-band) meant that plasma effects could not be       estimated and removed from radio data.           The HGA was a 1.0 m diameter dish of a Cassegrain design that       was directed in the spacecraft's +Z direction.           Science Objectives     ==================       Because of the relatively distant flyby (close approach = 500 km) of       the DI spacecraft past the nucleus of comet Tempel 1 and the rapid       relative velocity of the flyby (10.1 km/s), there was not expected       to be any indication of the spacecraft's deflection due to the       neighboring comet mass nor was there expected to be any indication       that the spacecraft was slowed down as a result of gas and dust drag       upon the spacecraft.  Both of these expectations came to pass (i.e.,       no effects noted in the tracking data).  Yet, it is not out of the       question that future researchers will find a use for these tracking       data.           Operational Considerations - Spacecraft     =======================================       Descriptions given here are for nominal performance.  The       spacecraft transponder system comprised redundant units,       each with slightly different characteristics.  As       transponder units age, their performance changes slightly.       Their performance also depends upon factors which were not       always under the control of the DI Project.           Calibration Description - Spacecraft     ====================================       No information available.           Platform Mounting Descriptions - Spacecraft     ===========================================       The spacecraft +Z axis vector was aligned with the HGA boresight       perpendicular to the top surface of the spacecraft.  The +Y       axis vector ran through the power switching electronics box       and the +X axis completed the orthogonal, right-handed,       rectangular coordinate system.           The axes of the two low gain antennas were in the +Z and -Z       directions.           Investigators     =============       Team Leader for the DI Radio Science Team was D.K. Yeomans       of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).  Collaborating on       this investigation were Jon D. Giorgini and Steve R. Chesley,         Instrument Overview - DSN     =========================       Three Deep Space Communications Complexes (DSCCs) (near       Barstow, CA; Canberra, Australia; and Madrid, Spain) comprise       the DSN tracking network.  Each complex is equipped with       several antennas [including at least one each 70-m, 34-m High       Efficiency (HEF), and 34-m Beam WaveGuide (BWG)], associated       electronics, and operational systems.  A primary activity       at each complex is radiation of commands to and reception of       telemetry data from active spacecraft.  Transmission and       reception are possible in several radio frequency bands; the       most common are S-band (nominally a frequency of 2100-2300 MHz,       or a wavelength of 14.2-13.0 cm) and X-band (7100-8500 MHz, or       4.2-3.5 cm).  Transmitter output powers of up to 100 kW S-band       and 20 kW X-band are available.         Ground stations have the ability to transmit coded and uncoded       waveforms which can be echoed by distant spacecraft.  Analysis       of the received coding allows navigators to determine the       distance to the spacecraft; and analysis of Doppler shift on the       carrier signal allows estimation of the line-of-sight       spacecraft velocity.  Range and Doppler measurements are used       to calculate the spacecraft trajectory and to infer gravity       fields of objects near the spacecraft.         Ground stations can record spacecraft signals that have       propagated through or been scattered from target media.       Measurements of signal parameters after wave interactions with       surfaces, atmospheres, rings, and plasmas are used to infer       physical and electrical properties of the target.         The Deep Space Network (DSN) is managed by the Jet Propulsion       Laboratory (JPL) of the California Institute of Technology for       the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).

For design       specifications on DSN subsystems see [DSN810-5].         Subsystems - DSN     ================       The Deep Space Communications Complexes (DSCCs) are an integral       part of Radio Science instrumentation, along with the spacecraft       RFS and RFIS.  Their system performance directly determines the       degree of success of Radio Science investigations, and their       system calibration determines the degree of accuracy in the       results of the experiments.  The following paragraphs describe       the functions performed by the individual subsystems of a DSCC.

The DMC is the center of activity at a DSCC.  The         DMC receives and archives most of the information from the         NOCC needed by the various DSCC subsystems during their         operation.  Control of most of the DSCC subsystems, as well         as the handling and displaying of any responses to control         directives and configuration and status information received         from each of the subsystems, is done through the DMC.  The         effect of this is to centralize the control, display, and         short-term archiving functions necessary to operate a DSCC.         Communication among the various subsystems is done using a         Local Area Network (LAN) hooked up to each subsystem via a         network interface unit (NIU).           DMC operations are divided into two separate areas: the         Complex Monitor and Control (CMC) and the Network Monitor and         Control (NMC).  The primary purpose of the CMC processor for         Radio Science support is to receive and store all predict         sets transmitted from NOCC -- such as antenna pointing,         tracking, receiver, and uplink predict sets -- and then, at a         later time, to distribute them to the appropriate subsystems         via the LAN.  Those predict sets can be stored in the CMC for         a maximum of three days under normal conditions.  The CMC also         receives, processes, and displays event/alarm messages, and         maintains an operator log.  Assignment and configuration of         the NMCs is done through the CMC; to a limited degree the CMC         can perform some of the functions performed by the NMC.  There         are two CMCs (one on-line and one backup) and three NMCs at         each DSCC.   The backup CMC can function as an additional NMC         if necessary.           The NMC processor provides the operator interface for monitor         and control of a link -- a group of equipment required to         support a spacecraft pass.  For Radio Science, a link might         include one or more Radio Science Receivers (RSRs), the DSCC         Tracking Subsystem (DTK), and special equipment required for         Ka-band uplink and/or downlink (i.e., aberration correction,         monopulse receiver, and advanced media calibration system).         The NMC also maintains an operator log which includes all         operator directives and subsystem responses.  One important         Radio Science-specific function that the NMC performs is         receipt and transmission of the system temperature and signal         level data from the PPM, for display at the NMC console and         for inclusion in Monitor blocks.  These blocks are recorded         on magnetic tape as well as appearing in the NOCC displays.         The NMC is required to operate without interruption for the         duration of the Radio Science data acquisition period.           The Area Routing Assembly (ARA), which is part of the Digital         Communications Subsystem, controls all data communication         between the stations and JPL.  The ARA receives all required         data and status messages from the NMC/CMC, and can record them         to tape as well as transmit them to JPL via data lines.  The         ARA also receives predicts and other data from JPL, and passes         them on to the CMC.           DSCC Antenna Mechanical Subsystem       ---------------------------------         Multimission Radio Science activities require support from         the 70-m, 34-m HEF, and 34-m BWG antenna subnets.  The         antennas at each DSCC function as large-aperture collectors         which, by double reflection, cause the incoming radio         frequency (RF) energy to enter the feed horns.  The large         collecting surface of the antenna focuses the incoming energy         onto a subreflector, which is adjustable in both axial and         angular position.  These adjustments are made to correct for         gravitational deformation of the antenna as it moves between         zenith and the horizon; the deformation can be as large as         7 cm.  The subreflector adjustments optimize the channeling         of energy from the primary reflector to the subreflector,         and then to the feed horns.  The 70-m and 34-m HEF antennas         have 'shaped' primary and secondary reflectors, with forms         that are modified paraboloids.  This customization allows         more uniform illumination of one reflector by another.  The         BWG reflector shape is ellipsoidal.           On the 70-m antennas, the subreflector directs         received energy from the antenna onto a dichroic plate, a         device which reflects S-band energy to the S-band feed horn         and passes X-band energy through to the X-band feed horn.  In         the 34-m HEF, there is one 'common aperture feed,' which         accepts both frequencies without requiring a dichroic plate.         In the 34-m BWG, a series of small mirrors (approximately 2.5         meters in diameter) directs microwave energy from the         subreflector region to a collection area at the base of         the antenna -- typically in a pedestal room.  A retractable         dichroic reflector separates the S and X bands on some BWG         antennas, or the X and Ka bands on others.  RF energy to be         transmitted into space by the horns is focused by the         reflectors into narrow cylindrical beams, pointed with high         precision (either to the dichroic plate or directly to the         subreflector) by a series of drive motors and gear trains         that can rotate the movable components and their support         structures.           The different antennas can be pointed by several means.  Two         pointing modes commonly used during tracking passes are         CONSCAN and 'blind pointing.' With CONSCAN enabled and a         closed-loop receiver locked to a spacecraft signal, the         system tracks the radio source by conically scanning around         its position in the sky.  Pointing angle adjustments are         computed from signal strength information (feedback) supplied         by the receiver.  In this mode the Antenna Pointing Assembly         (APA) generates a circular scan pattern which is sent to the         Antenna Control System (ACS).  The ACS adds the scan pattern         to the corrected pointing angle predicts.  Software in the         receiver-exciter controller computes the received signal         level and sends it to the APA.  The correlation of scan         position with the received signal level variations allows the         APA to compute offset changes which are sent to the ACS.         Thus, within the capability of the closed-loop control         system, the scan center is pointed precisely at the apparent         direction of the spacecraft signal source.  An additional         function of the APA is to provide antenna position angles and         residuals, antenna control mode/status information, and         predict-correction parameters to the Area Routing Assembly         (ARA) via the LAN, which then sends this information to JPL         via the Ground Communications Facility (GCF) for antenna         status monitoring.           During periods when excessive signal level dynamics or low         received signal levels are expected (e.g., during an         occultation experiment), CONSCAN should not be used.  Under         these conditions, blind pointing (CONSCAN OFF) is used, and         pointing angle adjustments are based on a predetermined         Systematic Error Correction (SEC) model.           Independent of CONSCAN state, subreflector motion in at least         the z-axis may introduce phase variations into the received         Radio Science data.  For that reason, during certain         experiments, the subreflector in the 70-m and 34-m HEFs may         be frozen in the z-axis at a position (often based on         elevation angle) selected to minimize phase change and signal         degradation.  This can be done via Operator Control Inputs         (OCIs) from the NMC to the Subreflector Controller (SRC)         which resides in the alidade room of the antennas.  The SRC         passes the commands to motors that drive the subreflector to         the desired position.           Pointing angles for all antenna types are computed by         the NOCC Support System (NSS) from an ephemeris provided by         the flight project.  These predicts are received and archived         by the CMC.  Before each track, they are transferred to the         APA, which transforms the direction cosines of the predicts         into AZ-EL coordinates.  The LMC operator then downloads the         antenna predict points to the antenna-mounted ACS computer         along with a selected SEC model.  The pointing predicts         consist of time-tagged AZ-EL points at selected time intervals         along with polynomial coefficients for interpolation between         points.           The ACS automatically interpolates the predict points,         corrects the pointing predicts for refraction and         subreflector position, and adds the proper systematic error         correction and any manually entered antenna offsets.  The ACS         then sends angular position commands for each axis at the         rate of one per second.  In the 70-m and 34-m HEF, rate         commands are generated from the position commands at the         servo controller and are subsequently used to steer the         antenna.           When not using binary predicts (the routine mode for         spacecraft tracking), the antennas can be pointed using         'planetary' mode -- a simpler mode which uses right ascension         (RA) and declination (DEC) values.  These change very slowly         with respect to the celestial frame.  Values are provided to         the station in text form for manual entry.  The ACS         quadratically interpolates among three RA and DEC points         which are on one-day centers.           A third pointing mode -- sidereal -- is available for         tracking radio sources fixed with respect to the celestial         frame.           Also, at DSS 25, there is a special pointing mode to enable         tracking at Ka-band frequency.  Reception of the extremely         narrow beamwidth Ka-band signals required the development         of a monopulse receiver to continuously monitor and correct         antenna pointing to maintain lock on the signal peak.  And         an aberration correction system had to be implemented such         that the Ka-band uplink signal would be aimed at where the         spacecraft would be when the signal arrived (simultaneously         keeping the receiver pointed to where the downlink signal         was when it left the spacecraft).  This is accomplished by         mounting the Ka-band transmit feed on a movable X-Y platform         that can be displaced by as much as 30 millidegrees from the         received beam.  The monopulse tracking system (and Ka-band         downlink) will be implemented at the other BWGs by the end         of 2005.           Regardless of the pointing mode being used, a 70-m antenna         has a special high-accuracy pointing capability called         'precision' mode.  A pointing control loop derives the         main AZ-EL pointing servo drive error signals from a two-         axis autocollimator mounted on the Intermediate Reference         Structure.  The autocollimator projects a light beam to a         precision mirror mounted on the Master Equatorial drive         system, a much smaller structure, independent of the main         antenna, which is exactly positioned in HA and DEC with shaft         encoders.  The autocollimator detects elevation/cross-         elevation errors between the two reference surfaces by         measuring the angular displacement of the reflected light         beam.  This error is compensated for in the antenna servo by         moving the antenna in the appropriate AZ-EL direction.         Pointing accuracies of 0.004 degrees (15 arc seconds) are         possible in 'precision' mode.  The 'precision' mode is not         available on 34-m antennas -- nor is it needed, since their         beamwidths are twice as large as on the 70-m antennas.           DSCC Antenna Microwave Subsystem       --------------------------------         70-m Antennas: Each 70-m antenna has three feed cones installed         in a structure at the center of the main reflector.  The feeds         are positioned 120 degrees apart on a circle.  Selection of the         feed is made by rotation of the subreflector.  A dichroic mirror         assembly, half on the S-band cone and half on the X-band cone,         permits simultaneous use of the S- and X-band frequencies.  The         third cone is devoted to R&D and more specialized work.           The Antenna Microwave Subsystem (AMS) accepts the received S-         and X-band signals at the feed horn and transmits them through         polarizer plates to an orthomode transducer.  The polarizer         plates are adjusted so that the signals are directed to a pair         of redundant amplifiers for each frequency, thus facilitating         the simultaneous reception of signals in two orthogonal         polarizations.  For S-band these are two Block IVA S-band         Traveling Wave Masers (TWMs); for X-band the amplifiers are         Block IIA TWMs.           34-m HEF Antennas:  The 34-m HEF uses a single feed for both         S- and X-band.  Simultaneous S- and X-band receive as well as         X-band transmit is possible thanks to the presence of an S/X         'combiner' which acts as a diplexer.  For S-band, RCP or LCP         is user selected through a switch, so neither a polarizer nor         an orthomode transducer is needed.  The X-band amplification         options include two Block II TWMs or a High Electron Mobility         Transistor (HEMT) Low Noise Amplifier (LNA), while the S-band         amplification is provided by a Field Effect Transistor (FET)         LNA.           34-m BWG Antennas: These antennas use feeds and low-noise         amplifiers (LNA) in the pedestal room, which can be switched         in and out as needed.  Typically the following modes are         available:              1. downlink non-diplexed path (RCP or LCP) to LNA-1, with               uplink in the opposite circular polarization;            2. downlink non-diplexed path (RCP or LCP) to LNA-2, with               uplink in the opposite circular polarization;            3. downlink diplexed path (RCP or LCP) to LNA-1, with               uplink in the same circular polarization;            4. downlink diplexed path (RCP or LCP) to LNA-2, with               uplink in the same circular polarization.           For BWG antennas with dual-band capabilities (e.g., DSS 25)         and dual LNAs, each of the above four modes can be used in a         single-frequency or dual-frequency configuration.  Thus, for         antennas with the most complete capabilities, there are sixteen         possible ways to receive (2 polarizations, 2 waveguide path         choices, 2 LNAs, and 2 bands).           DSCC Receiver-Exciter Subsystem -- Pre-NSP       ------------------------------------------         The Receiver-Exciter Subsystem is composed of three groups of         equipment: the closed-loop receiver group (which includes the         exciter equipment), the open-loop receiver group, and the RF         monitor group.  This subsystem is controlled by the Receiver-         Exciter Controller (REC) which communicates directly with the         DMC for predicts, and for OCI reception and status reporting.           The exciter generates a sky-level signal which is provided to         the Transmitter Subsystem for the spacecraft uplink signal.         It is tunable under command of the DCO ( Digitally Controlled         Oscillator), which receives uplink predicts from the Metric         Data Assembly (MDA).           The diplexer in the signal path between the transmitter and         the feed horn for all antenna types (used for simultaneous         transmission and reception) may be configured such that it is         out of the received signal path (in listen-only or bypass         mode) in order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio in the         receiver system.           Closed-Loop Receivers: The current closed-loop group consists         of the Block V Receiver (BVR) and the Block V Exciter (BVE).         The BVR allows for simultaneous use of two receiver channels,         each configured independently of the other (thus allowing for         the reception of two different frequencies/wavelengths/bands,         or different polarizations of the same downlink band).  Based         on predicts from the MDA, the BVE provide a sky-level uplink         signal to either the low-power or the high-power transmitter.           The closed-loop receivers provide the capability for the rapid         acquisition of a spacecraft signal, and telemetry lock-up.  In         order to accomplish signal acquisition within a short time, the         receivers are predict driven to search for, acquire, and track         the downlink automatically.  Rapid acquisition precludes manual         tuning, though that remains as a backup capability.  The BVRs         utilize FFT analyzers for rapid lock-up.  The downlink predicts         are generated by the NSS and then transmitted to the CMC, which         sends them to the Receiver-Exciter Subsystem where two sets can         be stored.  The receiver starts acquisition at the beginning of         a track (pass), or at an operator-specified time.  The BVRs may         also be operated from the NMC without local operators attending         them.  The receivers also send performance and status data,         displays, and event messages to the NMC.           With the BVRs, the simulation (SIM) synthesizer signal is used         as the reference for the Doppler extractor.  The synthesizer is         adjusted before the beginning of the pass to a frequency that         is appropriate for the channel (i.e., within the band) of the         incoming signal; and will generally remain constant during the         pass.           The closed-loop receiver AGC loop can be configured to one         of three settings: narrow, medium, or wide.  It will be         configured such that the expected amplitude changes are         accommodated with minimum distortion.  The loop bandwidth         (2BLo) will be configured such that the expected phase         changes can be accommodated while maintaining the best         possible loop SNR.           Open-Loop Receivers: The open-loop Radio Science Receiver (RSR)         is a dedicated receiver that gets a downconverted signal (about         300 MHz), filters the signal to limit its bandwidth (to 265-375         MHz, centered at 320 MHz), and then further downconverts (to a         center frequency of 64 MHz) and digiti",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:ds1.ids,ION PROPULSION SYSTEM DIAGNOSTIC SUBSYSTEM for DS1,ION PROPULSION SYSTEM DIAGNOSTIC SUBSYSTEM,"     Instrument Overview   ===================     A suite of 12 diagnostic sensors was integrated into the Ion     Propulsion System (IPS) Diagnostic Subsystem (IDS). Two of     the instruments were the plasma wave antenna and search coil.     Time domain and spectrometer data were obtained from both sensors.     Scientific Objectives   =====================     The NASA Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) Technology Applications     Readiness (NSTAR) ion thruster operating aboard Deep Space 1     generates an environment that includes electrostatic, magnetic and     electromagnetic fields, charged particles, and neutral particles.     The thruster environmental components, in combination with the     natural space environment and the space vehicle, produce the     'induced environment.' The induced environment has the potential     of impacting the performance of spacecraft subsystems or science     sensors. The objective for the Ion Propulsion System (IPS)     Diagnostics Subsystem (IDS) flown on DS1 was to characterize these     environments within significant resource constraints.  Since the     measured effects of the IPS on the spacecraft environment proved     to be benign, the IDS was reprogrammed during flight to collect     solar induced wave data and signals caused by dust impact events     during the encounter.     Detectors   =========     Search Coil Magnetometers - Two single-axis search coil     magnetometers were mounted on the boom. One search coil is a new     technology miniaturized sensor developed in the JPL MicroDevices     Laboratory that uses a field rebalance technique for measurement.     The second search coil was a build-to-print of the Orbiting     Geophysical Observatory (OGO-6) single-axis sensor manufactured by     Space Instruments, Inc., Irvine, California. The second search     coil sensor was apparently damaged at the launch site by large AC     fields and was inoperable during the DS1 mission. Flight     measurements were performed with a measurement bandwidth over 10     Hz to 50 kHz. The full-scale range at 200 Hz is 100 nT with a     resolution of 1 pT. The AC magnetic fields were characterized as a     discrete power spectrum with four measurement intervals per     decade. The transient waveform for 'events' was also captured with     a sampling rate of 20 kHz for 500-msec windows. The transient     recorder was commanded at prescribed intervals.       Plasma Wave Antenna - A simply deployed dipole plasma wave antenna     (PWA) with adjustable-gain preamplifier was mounted onto the boom.     The PWA is a pair of low-mass Ni-Ti shape-memory alloy (SMA)     metallic strips with a tip-to-tip separation of 2 m. The PWA     deployment occurs upon exposure of the stowed SMA coiled ribbon to     the Sun. Within 2 hours, the PWA antenna slowly extends to its     deployed position. The PWA is connected to a low-noise     preamplifier that was built by TRW, Redondo Beach, California.     Flight measurements were performed in a low-frequency domain of 10     Hz to 100 kHz and a high-frequency domain of 100 kHz to 30 MHz.     The low-frequency domain is characterized by a voltage-swept band     pass filter with a minimum of four measurements per decade with an     amplitude range of 100 micro-V/m to 1000 mV/m. The high-frequency     domain is characterized with a minimum of four measurements per     decade with the same amplitude range as the low-frequency domain.     Transient waveform measurements were performed at a 20-kHz     sampling rate with a 500-msec circular buffer.     Electronics   ===========     IDS Architecture - IDS consists of two interconnected hardware     units: a Diagnostics Sensors Electronics Unit (DSEU) and a Remote     Sensors Unit. The IDS is an integrated package with one +28VDC and     dual MIL-STD-1553 serial communications interface to the DS1     spacecraft. The DSEU has 2 data sampling systems, a contamination     monitor, and a fields monitor (processor). The data provided was     processed using a Fields Measurement Processor (FMP). The FMP     consists of 3 boards: processor, spectrometer, and magnetometer.     The magnetometer is not discussed here. The spectrometer board     amplifies both the search coil and plasma wave signals for time     domain sampling and provides two identical low frequency, voltage     controlled tuned band passed filters. These two filters yield the     search coil and plasma wave data. For the plasma wave sensor, the     spectrometer has a bank of selectable high frequency band pass     filters.     Operational Modes   =================     The IDS contains two separate processor elements: the DSEU     microprocessor and the fields measurement processor     (FMP)[HENRYETAL2000]. The DSEU microprocessor supports the     communications interface with DS1, controls serial communications     with the FMP, and digitizes and controls the sensors within the     RSU. The IDS operates as a remote terminal on the DS1 MIL-STD-1553     serial bus. Telemetry from the RSU sensors is collected on 2-     second intervals and placed in selected 1553 subaddresses for     transmission to DS1. Configuration messages are transmitted to the     DSEU to select active sensors within the RSU and FMP and to     establish sweep ranges and gains for these sensors. Configuration     messages to the FMP are passed through the DSEU to the FMP     directly. The DSEU polls the FMP for data at half-second     intervals. In the typical FMP scan mode operation, a block of     sensor data is transmitted at 16-second intervals. Occasionally,     the FMP will transmit 0.5-second waveforms sampled at 20 kHz from     the plasma wave and search sensors and 120 s 20 Hz from the flux-     gate magnetometers. These 'burst' events can be commanded or     initiated via internal triggering within the FMP.     Location   ========     IDS was located adjacent to the ion engine on the DS1 spacecraft.     Measured Parameters   ===================     The IDS Plasma Wave Spectrometer characterized the electrostatic     wave and electromagnetic noise environments produced by the IPS     and other DS1 subsystems. A large volume of both spectral and     time-domain data were obtained throughout the DS1 mission,     especially during IPS operations. There is not a direct     correlation of noise amplitude with IPS operating power. The IPS     noise levels are bounded as follows:       o IPS E-field continuous noise: < 1 V/m, < 15 MHz.     o IPS E-field transient: < 2 V/m for < 1 ms.     o IPS B-field continuous noise: < 10 micro-T, < 10 kHz.     o IPS B-field transient: < 200 micro-T for < 2 ms.       Limits for the major DS1 subsystem noise sources, namely the     hydrazine reaction control subsystem (RCS) thrusters and engine     gimbal actuators (EGAs), are bounded by:       o RCS thruster E-field transient: < 5 V/m for < 10 ms.     o RCS thruster B-field transient: < 200 micro-T for < 40 ms.     o EGA B-field continuous noise: < 10 micro-T, at 100 Hz.     o EGA B-field transient: < 100 micro-T for < 1 s.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:ds1.micas,MINIATURE INTEGRATED CAMERA-SPECTROMETER for DS1,MINIATURE INTEGRATED CAMERA-SPECTROMETER," In the absence of input from the DS1 team     regarding the MICAS instrument, the personnel at the PDS SBN     assembled the following basic information.       Some additional information can be found in Soderblom et al.,     2000, 'Miniature Integrated Camera Spectrometer (MICAS) Validation     Report' [SODERBLOMETAL2000] which is included in the documents     directory.     Instrument Overview   ===================     The Miniature Integrated Camera Spectrometer (MICAS) is an     integrated multi-channel instrument that includes two visible-     wavelength imagers; a charged coupled device (VISCCD) and active     pixel sensor (APS), and two imaging spectrometers; short-     wavelength infrared (SWIR) and ultraviolet (UV). This instrument     was flown as a technology demonstration on the New Millennium     Program (NMP) Deep Space 1 (DS1) Mission. Table 1 provides a     summary of MICAS instrument optical specifications. MICAS has no     moving parts, uses a shared multi-wavelength long-focal length     primary 10-cm telescope and provides a multi-temperature set of     focal planes. The DS1 spacecraft also uses MICAS imaging for     autonomous optical navigation.     Technology Objectives   =====================     The technology objectives of the MICAS instrument project were to     flight validate the integrated, self-sequencing camera     spectrometer to enable future low-mass, low-power payloads for     NASA missions with severe mass and power constraints. MICAS     represents a new class of sensors for NASA science missions and     has broad applicability to a wide range of missions.       The principal MICAS technology (and major NMP DS1 investment) is     the integrated low-mass SiC multi-temperature, multi-focal-plane     structure, optical bench, and multi-wavelength optics. Using     methods and processes developed by SSG, both hot-pressed SiC (for     overall structure and optics) and composite SiC/SiC (for the SWIR     structure) were incorporated. The optics were fabricated from hot-     pressed SiC forms that were clad with silicon and then diamond     turned. The optical and thermal designs of MICAS have novel     elements as well. The SWIR focal plane uses a direct-drive     radiative cooler; the optical configuration using off-axis     diamond-turned spheres and off-axis toroidal gratings enable     higher throughput with improved point spread function performance.     The goal for multi-wavelength optical performance (e.g., providing     acceptable transmission from ultraviolet through near infrared:     ~50 to 5000 nanometers) was achieved with a series of optical     coatings: Pt for the primary mirror, SiC for the UV alone, Al for     combined VISCCD and SWIR, and Au for SWIR alone. The triangular     structure with externally mounted optical elements provided easy     access to all focal planes.    Table 1.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:ds1.pepe,PLASMA EXPERIMENT FOR PLANETARY EXPLORATION for DS1,PLASMA EXPERIMENT FOR PLANETARY EXPLORATION,"        Instrument Overview:    ====================    PEPE is designed to be a general- purpose plasma sensor capable of    measuring electrons and mass-resolved ions over most of particle phase    space from 8 eV to 33,500 eV. Because 3-axis stabilized spacecraft    pose a problem for complete coverage of all possible plasma arrival    directions, PEPE is also designed with a electrostatically scanned    field-of-view (FOV) that covers a solid angle of 2.8 pi steradians    once each 65 s. PEPE 'heritage' comes largely from work at the two    collaborating institutions: SwRI's development of miniaturized    electrostatic analyzer optics [YOUNGETAL1998] and LANL's development    of linear electric field (LEF) time-of flight (TOF) mass spectrographs    [MCCOMASETAL1998; NORDHOLTETAL1998;].        PEPE contains three sensors integrated within a single housing.    PEPE contains a number of components such as electron    multiplier detectors, carbon foils, and high ohmic surfaces that are    sensitive to particulate and chemical contamination, The most    sensitive instrument, the ion mass spectrometer, was protected with a    cover that was deployed in flight. The two other sensors were flown    without covers. Our calculations indicated that PEPE could survive the    launch environment without a deployable cover, thereby saving cost,    complexity and mass. Throughout ground handling, PEPE was fitted with    sealed cover through which N2 purge gas was flushed. The cover was    removed before the rocket fairing door was closed, but the purge    continued through launch. PEPE in-flight performance indicates that    the instrument did not suffer any deleterious effects caused by this    approach.        The PEPE optical system is rotationally symmetric about the central    vertical axis and consists entirely of electrostatic elements. The    optical system consists of three main functional elements: Angular    deflection optics, energy/charge analyzers, and the LEF TOF optics.    PEPE is located on a bracket at the upper (+Z) end of the +X-Y panel    of the spacecraft such that the central plane of the PEPE    FOV lies in the spacecraft XZ plane. This gives PEPE access to both    the nominal solar wind direction and to the DS1 Miniaturized    Camera/Spectrometer (MICAS) boresight    direction located along the spacecraft +Z axis. PEPE FOV coordinates    are illustrated in Figure 1. The 3-axes of the PEPE coordinate    system are parallel to those of the spacecraft.  Arrows in the    figure indicate the sense of the numbering of angular pixels that    make up the PEPE FOV. The angular coordinates for azimuth    are defined between 0 and 359 degrees and correspond to the direction    of arrival for both positively and negatively charged particles (e.g.,    +90 deg azimuth indicates particles arriving from the direction of    the spacecraft -Z axis). The angular coordinates for elevation    are defined as the direction of arrival of positively    charged particles. Because of the nature of the deflection electric    field that controls the PEPE elevation viewing direction, the    direction of arrival of negatively charged particles is the opposite    of that shown in Figure 1.        The entire PEPE ion mass analysis system weighs less than 1 kg, uses    less than one watt of power, is extremely compact and is designed to    be integrated very tightly with the power supplies that drive it.    Close integration with the power supplies is important to keep the    mass and volume of PEPE down.  Often, TOF mass spectrometers using    high voltages require large standoff distances that translate into a    large volume and thus a high mass device.  The 15kV and ion MCP high    voltage power supplies are designed to plug directly into the    time-of-flight cylinder without the use of conventional high voltage    connectors or cables.      High Voltage Power Supply Subsystem. The PEPE electrostatic optics and    MCP detectors nominally require 8 high voltage sources ranging in    maximum absolute values from 3600 V for the MCPs to 15,000 V for the    TOF. Four of these voltages    (two for MCPs and positive and negative 15,000 V for the LEF TOF) are    obtained from independently programmable high voltage power supplies    (HVPS) that are adjustable over an 8-bit range but are otherwise    static. Each deflection electrode requires a programmable bi-polar    stepping supply (i.e., one that simultaneously creates equal negative    and positive potentials) while the ion and electron ESA's are operated    from two independent supplies. The most efficient way to generate the    interrelated deflection and ESA voltages is to employ a so-called    'bulk' supply that biases the two bi-polar deflection supplies and the    ESA supplies into a coarse operating range from which finer voltage    steps can be set. The result is a power and component    efficient system with 12-bit programmable high voltage control between    2500 V for the ESA's and ? 5000 V for the deflection electrodes.        Because of the large number of HVPS in PEPE, efficient packaging of    the supplies was critical. The method chosen eliminated HV cables and    bulky connectors entirely. As mentioned above, the ion MCP and the two    TOF supplies are each built into small easily installed metal-plated    plastic boxes that insert into the central portion of the PEPE body.    High voltage connectors are standard pin and socket connectors with    insulating sleeves that interleave as the pins mate. The electron MCP    supply is located on the same circuit board as the MCP and amplifiers.    Because of the need for close proximity of supplies to the deflection    and ESA electrodes, each ESA supply is located on a single circuit    board that also carries the inner ESA toroid, inside of which is the    ESA supply. The bi-polar deflection supplies are imbedded within the    structure that supports the deflection electrodes. The    interiors of all HVPS housings were parylene coated to passivate high    voltage components and increase the dielectric strength of the housing    insulation.        Scientific Objectives:    ======================    The primary scientific objective of the PEPE investigation is to study    the interaction of the solar wind with small solar system bodies. On    July 29, 1999 DS1 flew past Asteroid Braille (formerly 1992 KD) at a    closest approach distance of 27 +/- 2 km (K. Fleming, personal    communication). Unfortunately the encounter miss distance was well    outside the planned value of  ~7 km. The encounter geometry was also    outside nominal values. Those circumstances, coupled with the apparent    hard mineral makeup of Braille (e.g., pyroxene or similar), limited    the charged particle signal that could be expected at DS1. Indeed, the    PEPE data failed to show any evidence of solar wind interaction with    the asteroid.        Following the encounter with Braille, PEPE will have had the    opportunity to sample the comas of two very different comets in 2001.    Comet Wilson Harrington is thought to be a low activity highly    outgassed body with little coma activity. Although a gas outburst was    observed in 1949 [FERNANDEZETAL1997], it is presently unclear what    the gas production rate will be during the planned encounter in early    2001.  The second object, Comet Borrelly, is a relatively young    object and was should be relatively active. The combination of    observations near these two objects will allow PEPE to break new    ground in the comparative study of the evolution of cometary comas and    their composition.        A second important PEPE scientific objective is the study of solar    wind ion composition and ion and electron velocity distributions.  DS1    and PEPE will provide a solar wind observation platform well away from    the Earth during most of the mission. Data from PEPE during these    periods can be applied to 3-dimensional studies of large scale    structures in the solar wind, for example the evolution of coronal    mass ejections from the sun. Simultaneous studies early in the DS1    mission will combine data from PEPE, Wind, ACE and Cassini plasma    instruments to calibrate PEPE response. Solar wind data will also    support demonstration of PEPE's operational capabilities in the plasma    environment of the DS1 spacecraft. The quality, accuracy, and    consistency of scientific observations of the solar wind made with    PEPE will help establish the appropriateness and utility of new    technologies incorporated into its design.        Calibration:    ============    Ions and electrons enter the PEPE optics through a grounded toroidal    grid that defines the external acceptance aperture of the instrument.    The grid also terminates the electric fields within PEPE. Immediately    inside the grounded grid, ions and electrons entering PEPE experience    an electric field that deflects them into the acceptance volume of the    top-hat electrostatic analyzers. The deflection electric field is    generated by two opposing, cylindrically symmetric toroidal    electrodes. Equal voltages of opposite polarity are applied to the    deflection electrodes so that, for example, ions coming from above the    symmetry plane are deflected in the direction of the top-hat    apertures, while electrons coming from below the plane are also    deflected toward the top-hat apertures. The top-hat analyzers, one for    ions and one for electrons, are positioned so that their apertures are    located symmetrically above and below the central plane of the    aperture. As ions and electrons enter the region of the top-hat    analyzer electric fields they are deflected down or up into their    respective electrostatic energy analyzers. Up to this point the    optical systems are identical for ions and electrons.        Elevation Deflection Analysis. The deflection optics consists of    matching upper and lower toroidal deflectors whose shape is an    exponential given by the equation:            z = k1 +/- k2 exp[k3(r - k4)]                          (1)        where z is the height of a point above the aperture mid-plane and r is    the corresponding radius from the central axis. The value of k4    determines the radius of the inner edge of the deflection toroids and    is 6.00 cm in PEPE. Although rectilinear deflector profiles can give    nearly the same performance, an exponential shape was chosen because    it offers the highest deflection sensitivity for a given plate voltage    [ZHIGAREV1975). The particular configuration of the deflection plates    themselves was also designed to create space underneath the electrodes    for the placement of high voltage supplies. This improves engineering    architecture at the expense of the deflection constant and hence    magnitude of the applied voltage.        The relationship between the angle of charged particle deflection    (Gamma), the deflection voltage (VD) in volts placed on the    electrodes, and the particle energy/charge (E/Q) in eV was obtained by    ray-tracing and is given by:            Gamma(deg) = k5 Q*VD/(E/Q) + 0.9deg.                   (2)        Both VD and Q are to be taken as signed quantities. Thus, for    electrons Q = -1 and if VD is positive then Gamma is a negative    quantity in Figure 1. The nominal value of k5 = 134.5 deg per charge    with a slight variation of < 10ver the elevation range of +/- 45deg.    The constant of 0.9 deg represents an offset in the top-hat field of    view. Voltages up to a maximum of +/- 5000 V can be applied to the    electrodes which places a limiting value on the maximum angle through    which particles of a given energy can be deflected:            Gamma-max(deg) = 6.725 x 10**5/(E/Q).                  (3)        This means that the maximum FOV deflection at the upper limit of the    PEPE energy range (33,500 eV) is 20.0 deg per charge [Then how do we    get +- 45o?]. The angular resolution of the instantaneous FOV is 4 deg    FWHM for electrons and 3.6 deg FWHM for ions. These values are set by    the separation of the deflection electrodes and the intervening    collimation and are designed to match the acceptance aperture of the    ESA optics.        Different angular directions are accepted by stepping the deflection    voltages through a program that causes the central FOV angle of regard    to move from -45 to +45 deg (or vice versa depending on charge sign)    in 16 linearly spaced steps. Equation (2) shows the relationship    between particle energy/charge and the deflection angle. This implies    that the voltage VD is dependent on the voltage VE that is applied to    the energy/charge analyzer and determines the energy of particles    accepted.        Energy/charge and Angle. After passing through the angle deflection    electrodes, ions and electrons enter an electric field created by two    facing toroidal top-hat ESA's. Each ESA consists of concentric    toroidal electrodes with a cutout in the outer electrode which    functions as the ESA entrance aperture. Toroidal shapes are chosen    because they result in a larger aperture area per unit of ESA    electrode area [YOUNGETAL1989]. When a voltage is applied to the inner    electrode (positive for the electron ESA, negative for the ion ESA),    charged particles with the appropriate energy/charge and angle travel    through the electric field to the exit of the ESA. Different energies    are sampled by stepping the voltage on the ESA inner toroids. At the    same time that the ESA voltage is stepped, so is the deflection    voltage according to the relation given by (5).        The open area formed by cutouts in the outer, grounded ESA toroids    expose the oppositely charged inner toroids. This sets up an electric    field that deflects ions and electrons into their respective energy    analyzers. The toroidal apertures are set back 15 deg from the    vertical. The ESAs are designed so that electrons travel through a    bending angle of 90 deg, 75 deg of which are spent in the ESA. Ions    travel through a total bending angle of 115 deg of which 100 deg are    in the ESA. The combination of toroidal electrode separation and ESA    bending angle sets the energy passband at (Delta)E/E = 0.085 (FWHM)    for the electron ESA and 0.050 for the ion ESA.        The relationship of voltage on the ESA to ion and electron E/Q is    given by:            E/Q = k6 * VE                                          (4)        Where k6 = 13.07 is an unsigned constant of the ESA geometry and is    identical for the ion and electron analyzers. Substitution of Equation    (4) into (2) gives the control equation for the combined    deflection/energy analyzer system:         Gamma(deg) = 10.27 VD/VE.                                 (5)        Electrons exiting the electron ESA are accelerated by +200 V onto a    conversion dynode. Electric fields in the dynode/MCP volume focus the    electrons in two directions so that beam image size is kept to a    minimum and azimuthal angle of arrival information is preserved. The    purpose of the dynode optics is to convert incoming primary electrons    into secondary electrons of a few eV that can be easily focused on to    25 mm active diameter MCP. The toroid major radius at which the    electrons exit the ESA is 41.66 mm, whereas the area onto which they    are focused on the MCP is an annulus 6 to 12 mm in radius. The chief    considerations in using the conversion dynode were reduction in the    volume and complexity of a larger diameter MCP and holder, and    reduction in overall detector background. The secondary electron yield    of the nickel-plated Noryl(TM) plastic dynode material for penetrating    energetic electrons is low relative to the efficiency of MCP's for    these particles. The relative background improvement is calculated to    be a factor of ~3 [YOUNGETAL1998].        The LEF TOF mass analyzer processes neutralized and charged ions    differently.  In the case of neutralized ions, time-of-flight analysis    of neutralized ions is performed in the following manner: Ions exiting    the carbon foil eject one or more secondary electrons. These are    focused and accelerated into an annular outer ('start') section of the    MCP located at the far end of the time-of-flight section.    When the electrons are detected in the outer portion of the MCP, a    signal is sent to the PEPE time-to-digital converter to start a 83 MHz    clock.  The LEF optics are designed so that the neutralized ion    reaches the center portion of the micro-channel plate. When detected    by the MCP, the time-to-digital converter clock is stopped, a vernier    is applied to the time measurement, and the time of arrival as well as    the information that the center ('stop') section of the MCP was struck    is recorded.  Because energy per charge of the ion, the length of the    time-of-flight section, and the time-of-flight is now known, the mass    per charge of the ion can in principle be deduced from the following    equation:            M/Q=2(E/Q \373 Eloss/Q + Vacc)(T/D)2                   (6)        Where M is the mass of the incoming ion with energy/charge E/Q exiting    the ESA, Eloss is the amount of energy lost due to ion scattering in    the foil, Vacc is the TOF acceleration voltage, D is the average    length of the time-of-flight section and T is the time-of-flight. This    is called 'straight through' or linear mass analysis because the    electric fields inside the mass-analysis section do not affect    particles neutralized in the foils.  The mass resolution of this type    of analysis is typically low, primarily because of variations in path    length and particle energy introduced by the ESA, TOF geometry (finite    foil and MCP stop region sizes), and scattering in the foil. Both the    foil and the MCP have finite dimensions and the geometric paths of    neutrals through the TOF analyzer are not constrained. Therefore a    relatively large range of path lengths is possible. Which path is    taken depends on the entry point of the ion on the foil and on the    angle through which individual neutrals are scattered in the foil.    Secondly, the energy of ions striking the foils varies within a range    of may vary by up to 5%, set by ESA resolution. This energy range is    significantly reduced by accelerating the ions through a 15 kV    potential before they strike the foil. Furthermore, during traversal    of the foils energy variations are introduced by scattering. Lastly,    the finite resolution of the time-to-digital converter introduces    relatively small errors. Thus the finite size of the LEF TOF optical    elements (ESA exit aperture, foil and MCP) and the random scattering    in angle and energy introduce a number of uncertainties into the TOF    measurement. The resulting theoretical mass per charge resolution can    be expressed by adding the RMS values of these quantities [BETTS1979]:                (Delta)(M/Q)/(M/Q) = [SUM (Delta E) {E[(Delta)E/(E/Q -                             Eloss/Q + Vacc)]2 + [2(Delta)D/D]2 +                             [2(Delta)T/T]2}]1/2.               (7)        Where (Delta)E represents each uncertainty in energy introduced by    resolution and energy scattering effects, the sum (Delta E) is over    all such energy terms, E is the total particle energy entering the    foil, (Delta)D/D represents path length variations, and (Delta)T/T is    the electronic timing uncertainty.        In the case where the ions emerge from the carbon foil with a charge    state other than zero, they will be deflected by the electric field    induced in the TOF section.  This electric field is produced by a    -15kV potential applied to the entrance to the TOF section and a    matching +15kV potential applied to a spherical-shaped grid at the    exit of the region. The potentials create a well-defined voltage drop    of 30 kV along the sides of the TOF section induced by a resistive    coating.  The coating is applied to different sections of the time-of-    flight region with different methods. Deposition of a constant    thickness coating produced a constant drop in voltage.  Deposition of    a varying thickness that decreases proportionally to the distance from    the foils squared produces a comparable variation in the voltage    distribution and a linearly increasing electric field with distance    from the foils. This carefully constructed electric field creates a    restoring force on the ions in the direction of the axis asymmetry of    symmetry. The force varies linearly along the axis of symmetry and is    pointed towards the entrance (carbon foil) end of the TOF section.    Ion trajectories are confined to the center of the TOF cylinder so    that the linear electric field is not disturbed by any slight    variations or irregularities in the coatings. Ions below an energy of    approximately 18 keV will bounce in the field, executing simple    harmonic motion as they do so. As a consequence, ion energy and flight    path in the LEF portion of the TOF do not affect flight times with the    result that mass resolution is increased over that of the straight    through paths described above.  The ions act as though they were a    simple mass on a spring and thus the time of an oscillation in the    linear electric field region is proportional only to the mass per    charge of the particle. [MCCOMAS&NORDHOLT1990]. Ions with energies    above ~18 keV will exit the LEF without undergoing a bouncing motion.    Similarly, ions that leave the foil negatively charged will be    accelerated by the LEF down on to the stop region of the MCP and    analyzed with intermediate mass resolution.        At the end of their oscillation nearly 1000f the ions strike a    secondary emitter located at the center of the foil-end of the    time-of-flight cylinder.  Because of the properties of the cylindrical    electric field, ions that do not pass close to the center of the LEF    are deflected towards the cylinder walls and do not contribute to the    signal. Electrons ejected by the secondary emitter are focused onto    the stop region of the MCP and are processed in exactly the same    manner as the straight-through events described above. Because the    energy, angle, and variable path to length are no longer in the    equation for mass per charge of particle, mass resolution improves to    M/(Delta)M = 20. Since the same MCP is used for both the ST and LEF    stops, the results is a single spectrum with two peaks per species    (three peaks per species, in the case of species which may leave the    carbon foil with a negative charge.)        Detectors:    ==========    The electron detector consists of a stack of 3 individual MCP's    arranged in Z- configuration. The MCP is operated with the entrance    plate near ground potential and the exit at up to +3600 V. Large    (~ 0.5 cm**3) high voltage capacitors are needed to couple MCP pulses    to signal amplifiers whose inputs are near ground. The azimuthal FOV    is divided into 16 sectors that require 16 anodes and corresponding    signal chains and coupling capacitors. In order to save volume, the    printed circuit board itself (made of Rogers Corp. TMM3 (TM)) was    incorporated as the capacitor dielectric material sandwiched between    the 16 anodes and the corresponding Amptec A111 amplifier inputs.        The ion ESA bending angle of 100 deg was chosen to match the conical    shape of the top of the LEF time-of-flight cylinder to which it is    interfaced. Ions that exit the ESA are accelerated by voltages between    -8 kV and -15 kV onto ultra-thin (nominally 0.5-1.0 microgram/cm**2)    carbon foils located at the entrance to the LEF TOF analyzer.    (Although PEPE can operate at acceleration voltages below -15kV, the    latter is the nominal designed operating potential and will be used as    the standard value throughout the paper.) A slit electrode biased at    500f the ESA inner toroid voltage is located 1.5 mm past the ESA    exit. This electrode prevents fringing fields created by the -15 kV    acceleration potential from penetrating back into the ESA and causing    unwanted trajectory deflections.  A uniform electric field inside the    acceleration region leading up to the carbon foils is ensured by the    use of a high resistance coating on the inside wall of the ceramic    cylinder in the portion of the TOF section above the -15kV electrode    (see discussion below).        LEF TOF Analyzer. Ions enter the LEF TOF analyzer after being    accelerated by up to 15kV. Acceleration by 15kV ensures that even the    lowest energy ions will pass through the carbon foils with high    probability and relatively small scattering angles.  When (positive)    ions pass through the carbon foils their charge state may be changed.    Usually this means that the ion will attach an electron upon exiting    the foil and will be neutralized as a result.  A relatively small    percentage of ions (usually a few percent to ~30 0epending on species    and incident energy) will exit the foil positively charged.    Furthermore, a varying percentage (from a few to ~30 0epending on    energy and species) of incident ion species with finite electron    affinities (primarily H, C, and O) will exit the foils in a negative    charge state [BURGIETAL1990; FUNSTENETAL1993;].            Electronics:    ============    LEF TOF Electronics. The MCP housing for the time-of-flight section is    also a new design.  A chevron configuration of two high-gain MCPs is    used instead of a standard z- stack of three MCPs.  The MCP holder is    highly integrated and fits directly into the bottom of the    time-of-flight stack.  The capacitors and resistor needed to bias the    MCP stack and decouple signals are built directly into the MCP holder.    The anode is integrated behind the MCP holder and pins    from it couple directly into the amplifier and discriminator    electronics (termed the front-end electronics (FEE)) board.        All time-of-flight information is processed on the FEE board via    high-speed discriminators that encode the start channel that was hit    as well as initiating the time-to- digital (TDC) clock. In PEPE, three    constant fraction discriminators are coupled together to read out 8    individual anodes in a coded form.  Each amplifier/discriminator is    built as a chip-on-board (COB) module and 2 sets of 3 each are used to    read out a total of 16 anodes.  Eight of the anodes are devoted to    coarse measurement sectors, 6 that cover 41 deg each and 2 that cover    20.5 deg each.  Eight fine sector anodes cover 5.125 deg each.  The    symmetry of the PEPE entrance optics requires that all anodes have a    boundary at least every 45 deg.  Anode information is used to    determine from which azimuthal sector of the sky the ion entered.  The    voltage settings for the elevation and energy analyzers are also    reported so that all of the energy and angular information for a given    particle is known before any time-of-flight measurement is made.  All    signals from the start anodes are recorded as ion 'singles' data.  The    angular mapping of the PEPE field of view as seen from PEPE's position    on the spacecraft can be seen by combining the look angles with    the coordinate definitions given in Figure 1.        The central section of the stop MCP has its own high-speed    discriminator which, when triggered, stops the TDC clock.  Each    amplifier/discriminator consumes only 35 mW with transition times < 1    ns. The amplifier/discriminators use balanced input differential    voltages and have a 25,000 electron (25ke-) RMS equivalent noise with    a 150ke- threshold level (equivalent to 75mV).  A minimum signal of    300ke- is required from the MCP to achieve < 1 ns timing error.            The TDC is similar to that used in the Cassini CAPS ion mass    spectrometer (IMS).  To save power, the base oscillator runs at only    83 MHz.  The timing resolution of 750 ps is achieved by routing the    start and stop signals into a vernier delay line which determines the    ion time-of-flight to full resolution.  Bin widths may vary as much as    100ps in a repeating pattern because of variations in the width of the    taps in the delay line.  The TDC range is 40 ns to 1536 ns with a    pulse-pair resolution of 40 ns. The dead-time of the TOF read-out and    sorting electronics is 1.74 microseconds. Singles data, on the other    hand, are recorded with a dead time of 150 ns. The TDC includes its    own built-in test (BIT) that allows all of the COBs to be tested by    injecting a charge pulse at their inputs.  A variable start-to-stop    delay is also incorporated so that timing measurements can be checked.     This makes it possible to test the entire signal chain from the anode    to the DPU with the BIT. Correct operation can be verified at    integration time or in flight.  The TDC/FEE system also has its own    ground support equipment (GSE) and simulator so that the TDC/FEE/TOF    ion analysis section can be tested independently of the DPU and the    DPU can be run with known inputs from a TDC simulator.        Location:    =========    The PEPE optical system is rotationally symmetric about the central    vertical axis and consists entirely of electrostatic elements. The    optical system consists of three main functional elements: Angular    deflection optics, energy/charge analyzers, and the LEF TOF optics.    PEPE is located on a bracket at the upper (+Z) end of the +X-Y panel    of the spacecraft (Figure 3) such that the central plane of the PEPE    FOV lies in the spacecraft XZ plane. This gives PEPE access to both    the nominal solar wind direction and to the DS1 Miniaturized    Camera/Spectrometer (MICAS) boresight    direction located along the spacecraft +Z axis. PEPE FOV coordinates    are illustrated in Figure 1. The 3-axes of the PEPE coordinate    system are parallel to those of the spacecraft.  Arrows in the    figure indicate the sense of the numbering of angular pixels that    make up the PEPE FOV. The angular coordinates for azimuth    are defined between 0 and 359 degrees and correspond to the direction    of arrival for both positively and negatively charged particles (e.g.,    +90 deg azimuth indicates particles arriving from the direction of    the spacecraft -Z axis). The angular coordinates for elevation    are defined as the direction of arrival of positively    charged particles. Because of the nature of the deflection electric    field that controls the PEPE elevation viewing direction, the    direction of arrival of negatively charged particles is the opposite    of that shown in Figure 1.            Operational Modes:    ==================    Energy/angle scan programs are controlled by    re-programmable voltage tables stored in on-board memory. The ESA    voltage is held constant at one of 120 levels while the deflection    voltage is stepped over a program of 16 linearly-spaced voltages that    follow Equation 5. Each step is held for 32 ms so that a full    elevation scan of +/- 45 deg is covered in 512 ms. Out of the 32.0 ms    interval, 4.0 ms is set aside as settling time for the high voltage    supplies. After a deflection voltage sweep is completed, the ESA    voltage is advanced to the next step. ESA steps are spaced at    logarithmic intervals such that the energy range is covered in 120    contiguous steps. Eight additional steps, during which the ESA is held    at zero voltage, are used for detector background measurements. The    complete elevation angle/energy range of PEPE is covered in 16 x 128 x    0.032 s = 65.536 s. In order to enhance PEPE performance during the    flyby of Asteroid Braille, a fast-scanning mode was created that    covered a smaller region of interest (ROI) in energy/angle space (16    deflection x 16 energy steps) using a shorter sampling interval of 8.0    ms.      Measured Parameters:    ====================    During each 32.0 ms sample    interval, data from the 16 angle-sorted electron and ion    counter/registers as well as valid ion TOF event and related logical    event registers are accumulated in a double-buffered dual-ported    memory in the data acquisition subsystem (DAQ). Data continue to be    accumulated throughout one full angle/energy scan (65.5 s) at the end    of which they are made available to the Harris RTX2010 microprocessor.    The ion and electron data are stored in the MQ, TOF, and SINGLES    memories that are operated in ping-pong fashion in order to allow the    processor",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At selected DSN stations, an advanced version (AWVR)                   measures emissions at 20.7 and 31.4 GHz along the line of sight to a                  spacecraft being tracked.

The AMC is capable of measuring the tropospheric                   relative frequency shift under summer conditions with a precision of                   better than 1e-14.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:dushanbe.rcc.sanglok,Sanglok Observatory Photometer-Polarimeter,Sanglok Observatory Photometer-Polarimeter,"The single-channel photometer-polarimeter at Sanglok Observatory was built at the Institute of Astrophysics of Tadjik Academy of Sciences. It allowed quasi-simultaneous photometric and polarimetric observations. The useble wavelength range was 0.35-0.75 microns. The polarimeter worked on the modulation principle with a rapidly-rotating polarizer as the analyzer. The rotation frequency of the polarizer was about 33 revolutions per second. Four impulse counters were used to registrate impulses during each quarter of a polarizer revolution. The total number of impulses in four positions of the polarizer allow the derivation of the values of the Stokes Q and U parameters and hence the value of the degree of linear polarization and the position angle. The observing procedure included consecutive measurements of an object and a sky background near the object with the same diaphragm.  To control the stability of instrument operation the measurements of a built-in signal generator were used.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:epps-eps.mess,Energetic Particle and Plasma Spectrometer Energetic Particle Spectrometer for MESSENGER,EPPS Energetic Particle Spectrometer,"            The Energetic Particle Spectrometer (EPS) is part of the MESSENGER             Energetic Particle and Plasma Spectrometer (EPPS) system, which             which also includes the Fast Imaging Plasma Spectrometer (FIPS).            EPS covers the energy range of 25 to > 500 keV for electrons,             and 10 keV/nucleon to ~3 MeV total energy for ions. The desired            throughput for FIPS charged particle and EPS event processing is 5            kHz. The Johns Hopkins University/Applied Physics Laboratory            constructed the EPS instrument.              The EPS determines the distributions of the higher-energy            magnetospheric ion and electrons, including the composition of the            ions, to characterize the nature of the planetary field of Mercury.            It does this by measuring the energy and velocity of the particles            and then using a look-up table to determine the mass and therefore            the species of particle. The measured species for the EPS include            H, He, CNO, Fe, and electrons. Electrons are measured by solid-            state detectors behind absorbing aluminum flashing.              The EPS sensor consists of a 60-mm diameter, tuna-can-like            cylinder, in which a start foil and stop foil, wrapped around            opposite curved sides of the cylinder, constitute the TOF chamber.            An incoming particle hits the start foil and scatters one or more            electron, which is attracted to the start-anode ground.  The            particle continues and hits the stop foil, scattering other            electrons, which are then attracted to the stop-anode ground. The            solid-state detectors outside of, but wrapped around the curved            face of, the stop foil, then detect the particle and measure the            energy state.              The detectors are arranged so that each detector senses the events            within a given range of incidence angles.  Each of the 6 detector            modules is composed of 4 pixels: large and small ion and large and            small electron. This provides 24 detector elements. At any one            time, 12 of the 24 elements are used (6 ion and 6 electron            detectors). Each of the 6 EPS detector modules also maintains its            own spectrum via 64 16-bit bins. 63 bins will count the            particle/energy combinations of interest, and 1 will count the            remaining background events that do not fall in the particle/energy            combinations of interest. The spectra are accumulated over a time            set by ground command, after which they are compressed and reported            in telemetry.              The EPS system also includes 32 16-bit rate counters and 3 24-bit            rate counters that are read by the EPPS software every n seconds (n            specified by command). EPS status and housekeeping data such as            voltages, currents, and temperatures are also periodically sampled.              The EPPS instrument is described in full detail in            Andrews, et al., 2007.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:epps-fips.mess,Energetic Particle and Plasma Spectrometer Fast Imaging Plasma Spectrometer for MESSENGER,EPPS Fast Imaging Plamsa Spectrometer,"            The Energetic Particle Spectrometer (EPS) is part of the MESSENGER             Energetic Particle and Plasma Spectrometer (EPPS) system, which             which also includes the Fast Imaging Plasma Spectrometer (FIPS).            FIPS covers the energy/ charge range of < 50 eV/q to 20 keV/q. The             desired throughput for FIPS charged particle and EPS event processing             is 5 kHz. The FIPS instrument was constructed by the University of             Michigan Space Physics Research Laboratory.              The FIPS sensor is designed to measure the distributions and            composition of magnetosphere ions, as well as to characterize the            nature of the planetary magnetic field of Mercury.  It will do this            by measuring the mass per charge, the energy per charge, and            incident angles for particles entering the sensor.  The particle            intensity is also calculated from the event rate information.  FIPS            generates a single 48-bit raw event packet format, which includes a            1-bit header that identifies the event as a proton event or a            non-proton event; an 11-bit time-of-flight (TOF) value; as well as            Wedge, Strip, and ZigZag values (each 12 bits in size). In addition,            the FIPS system generates counter and housekeeping information that            the EPPS software can access via the I2C bus interface.              The FIPS consists of an electrostatic analyzer (ESA), located at the            entrance to the sensor, a post-acceleration chamber between the            output of the ESA and the carbon foil, and a time-of-flight            telescope.  The ESA at the entrance to the FIPS acts as a wide-angle            lens for ions.  It only allows ions with a specific energy/charge            band to enter through its output plane.  This band is stepped once            per second by changing the deflection voltage of the ESA.  A            measurement cycle consists of 64 deflection voltage steps in nominal            mode or 8 in burst mode.  Associated with each step in a scan is a            voltage setting, a threshold, a settling time, and a duration or            time interval after which the next voltage step is performed.  Ions            exit the output plane of the ESA and are then accelerated in the            post- acceleration chamber.  This acceleration is done to boost            low-energy ions to penetrate the carbon foil.  The acceleration also            helps to reduce energy straggling and angular scattering - effects            that cause degradation in mass resolution and imaging.  The carbon            foil serves as the source for secondary electrons, which are            scattered out by the penetration ions.  After penetrating the foil,            the particle resides within the TOF chamber where velocity and            incoming angle are computed.  Velocity is determined by the time            difference between the generation of secondary electrons in the            start foil and a stop surface, and angle is determined by spatially            imaging the position of the generation of the start secondary            electrons.  From the velocity, energy per charge, and the            post-acceleration potential, it is then possible to calculate the            mass per charge.  The measured species for the FIPS range from H to            Fe.              The FIPS instrument provides a single serial stream of event data to            the EPPS system at rates of up to 50000 events per second.  The EPPS            software maintains a mass distribution spectrum for the FIPS            instrument. This spectrum consists of a collection of 256 bins (each            24 bits wide) that count the number of events corresponding to mass-            per-charge values. In addition, the software maintains a set of 5            element energy spectra.  Each FIPS spectrum corresponds to a            specified mass-per-charge range and consists of 64 24-bit bins.  For            events whose mass-per-charge values fall within one of the selected            ranges, an energy value is computed and used to determine which bin            within the corresponding spectrum to increment. The spectra are            accumulated over an integral number of voltage scans, after which            they are compressed and output in telemetry.  FIPS also records 5            heavy-ion energy-summed images (called velocity distributions) for            each of the same 5 mass-per-charge values plus one for protons.  A            commanded number of raw events will be recorded at each scan level.              The EPPS instrument is described in full detail in            Andrews, et al., 2007.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:eso-la_silla.ntt.eso_multi,Eso Multimode Instrument,Eso Multimode Instrument,"Instrument Overview =================== EMMI is a flexible instrument which allows a wide range of observing modes, from wide-field imaging to high-dispersion echelle spectroscopy, including long-slit and multi-object spectroscopy. This manual also describes SUSI (SUperb Seeing Imager) which is mounted in the other Nasmyth focus of the NTT and complements the imaging capabilities of EMMI.  A brief description of the active optics system of the NTT and its basic operational principles are also provided in this manual.  The driving concepts in the instrument definition were the high image quality foreseen for the NTT, the need to complement or improve on the instrumentation on the 3.6m telescope, and the need to minimize instrument change-overs.  The concept which was adopted is that of a dual-beam instrument, fully dioptric, and based on the white pupil principle.  CCD detectors were foreseen for the two arms with the possibility to adapt to the geometric characteristics of future detectors by changing the cameras only.  The main advantages of this type of design are the high efficiency in both channels and the easy conversion from wide field imaging to grism and grating spectroscopy.  After the first observations with the NTT, it became clear that the telescope and the atmosphere at La~Silla could provide stellar images with diameters as good as 0.3 arcsec.  Images of this quality could not be sampled adequately with EMMI, which scale had also to be adapted to the spectroscopic modes of observation.  Thus, SUSI was designed and built for the other Nasmyth arm of the NTT.  The design is such that switching between EMMI and SUSI is done in a matter of minutes, so that they can be considered as different parts of the same instrument.   Optics ====== A detailed description of the optical design of EMMI can be found in Dekker et al. (1986).  It has two 'arms' with separate detectors. One arm ('EMMI blue arm') is coated for high efficiency in the region 300 to 500 nm, the other ('EMMI red arm') for 400 to 1000~nm.  Each arm supports several different observing modes.  The capabilities of the blue and the red arm are not identical, e.g. Multi-Object Spectroscopy (MOS) is only available in the red arm.  Each of the two arms has two possible light paths: one is used for grating spectroscopy and the other for imaging and (only in the red arm) low-resolution spectroscopy using grisms.  In grating spectroscopy, a dichroic can be inserted into the beam allowing the use of both arms at the same time. Each of the five possible light paths (two per arm plus the dichroic mode) is called an 'Observing Mode'. The five modes are called:  BIMG: Blue Imaging For wavelengths less than 500 nanometer, 0.37 arc sec/pixel resolution and a field of view of 6.2 arc min by 6.2 arc min.   Cameras and Detectors ===================== EMMI works with two scientific CCD cameras, one at the red arm and one in the blue arm.  The image scale at the F/11 Nasmyth foci of the NTT is 5.36 arcsec/mm or 186 micron per arc sec.  This is also the scale of the direct imaging with SUSI.  The actual field size and scale depend on the detector and camera being used and are given in  Image scale for EMMI and SUSI  EMMI BIMG   #31 TEK 1024  F/4   24 micron/0.37 arc sec  CCD characteristics for EMMI and SUSI  # 31 slow mode  1.7e/ADU conversion  2.5ADU RON  280.2ADU BIAS 8e DARK      fast       3.4                  1.6         275.2         8  Saturation is in most cases defined by the ADU converter, at 65 kADU. The actual well depth is around 2 x 10^6 e so that the linearity is good up to digital saturation. The exceptions are EMMI red and SUSI when read out in fast mode. For EMMI red in the fast mode, exposure levels should be kept below 40 kADU, and for SUSI below 24kADU. Otherwise, the linearity of the CCD is better than 0.5%. The measured linearity curves can be found in the CCD test reports.  The fast readout mode has as main advantage a reduced readout time. This becomes important on EMMI red where fast readout saves two minutes. It is much less important in SUSI. The disadvantage is increased readout noise and digitization noise, and sometimes increased electric interference. For broadband imaging and many spectroscopic programmes, the readout noise is not important compared to the photon background, and the fast readout mode would be recommended.  Electronic interference could be larger in fast readout:  when in doubt, it is worthwile to take a few biases in the afternoon to check on the readout noise and on the presence of pattern noise.  Remember that, in general, calibration frames such as bias, flat fields, and darks taken with slow readout cannot be used for correcting fast exposures, and vice versa.  CCDs have an electronic bias that can be evaluated by averaging several 0s dark exposures and subtracted from the science images to take it out. By using these exposures the observer can check the CCD readout noise and possible pick-up patterns in the electronic background.  At least one, but if possible more, long (at least 1 hour) dark exposures are important to monitor the dark current of the CCD (if possible, take a dark longer than the longest science exposure).   Filters ======= EMMI has four filter wheels: the blue and red imaging filter wheels, and the blue and the red below-slit wheels. The last two are only used for grating spectroscopy and usually contain neutral density filters only. Each of the two filter wheels used for imaging has 9 positions of which 8 are available for mounting filters and one is kept free. The R-filter is usually needed for focusing.  Both red and blue filters have a free circular diameter of 80 mm and an outside diameter of 85~mm.  Adapter trays are available for filters of other instruments (e.g. EFOSC) but use of smaller filters will produce vignetted images only useful in the centre of the CCD.  In such cases it might be better to use SUSI.  The SUSI filterwheel has 8 positions of which 7 are available for filters.  In contrast to EMMI, SUSI uses 60-mm filters which are the same size as the ones used for EFOSC. EFOSC filters can therefore also be mounted in SUSI (if they are not required by the EFOSC observer!).  There are also a large number of 60-mm filters which are not allocated to a particular instrument and which can be requested.  All filters are permanently mounted in special cells which make replacement very easy.  EMMI red-arm filters, which are inserted in a parallel beam, are mounted at 5 degree inclination to avoid reflections between the CCD and the filter.  Blue arm filters, used in the converging beam in front of the blue camera, do not show this effect and hence are mounted with no inclination.  Using a red-arm filter in the blue will result in a slight change of the central wavelength and will cause some astigmatism. If a blue filter is used in the red arm, every object in the field produces a ghost due to the mentioned reflections, which is about 5 magnitudes fainter than the original object. Thus, although it is possible to use blue filters in the red and vice-versa (one might want to do this in the overlap region, 400 to 500 nm), filters should normally be used in the wheel they are intended for.  Filters with very narrow bandwidths are not really suitable for the red arm. Because the filters are mounted in the parallel beam, the central wavelength will change across the field. In extreme cases, the central wavelength may be outside the filter response near the edge of the CCD.  The tabulated wavelength corresponds to the centre of the CCD. The effect is further described in Chapter 11. As a guide line, avoid filters with wavelength change <5 nm for wide-field imaging.  This effect also affects wide-field photometry if using narrow filters.  The ESO Image Quality Filters Catalogue (Gilliotte, 1992) contains a list of available filters and transmission curves.  More recently (1995), a number of new filters have been acquired and all transmission curves re-measured.  This new data can be viewed using the MIDAS graphical user interface (GUI) {\tt FILTERS}, available in MIDAS version 94NOV or later. The most recent version is always available in La Silla. Lists of standard EMMI filters are also given in Chapters 5 (RILD) and 6 (BIMG), respectively (Tables 5.1 and 6.1), and a list of standard SUSI filters in Chapter 11 (of the manual).   Calibration =========== There is a system of calibration lamps associated with the adapter/rotators at the NTT which can be used for most of the wavelength calibrations required for the EMMI data.  The main component of the calibration system is an integrating sphere mounted on the side of the adapter.  Light from the output aperture of the integrating sphere passes a lens and is reflected to the center of the focal plane by a 45 degree mirror which is moved to the optical axis. On the integrating sphere He, Ar, and ThAr lamps are mounted, while the light of flatfield and other spectral lamps that are mounted in a rack on the floor is fed to the sphere through an optical fibre.  The fiber induces some broad absorption features around 724 micron and 880 micron which do not occur in the scientific data.  The angular size, location, and shape (including central obscuration) of the NTT exit pupil are approximately simulated.  The illumination is homogeneous and unvignetted in a 3 arc min by 6 arc min field and is still usable in a field of 5 arc min by 8 arc min which is the maximum field size for MOS.   Processing ========== The data from the EMMI and SUSI detectors are simultaneously transmitted to IHAP and MIDAS databases.  MIDAS runs on a Unix workstation equipped with a DAT tape unit. IHAP uses standard 1/2 inch 2400~foot tapes at 6250 BPI with a total capacity of 45 by 1024 times 1024 images in FITS format.  The FITS headers of CCD files contain all the information necessary for the scientific use of the data, that is all the telescope, instrument, and detector parameters. Most of these parameters are stored in so-called hierarchical keywords. MIDAS can read these keywords, but some other packages may not since these are an extension of the FITS standard. If you are not using MIDAS, it is worth to check the actual FITS header for further information which may be useful.   Electronics =========== The NTT is controlled by two HP1000/A900 computers, one for the telescope (called NTT) and one for the instruments (called NTI). The control software of EMMI is organized in such a way that EMMI is presented as five sub-instruments called RILD, REMD, BIMG, BLMD, and DIMD.  Depending on the type of observations, the user selects one of these modes and the control software automatically moves the functions to be set for this mode.  This leaves only the parameters of the particular type of observation to be defined.  For instance, when setting up an exposure in RILD, the required mirror unit and the upper red folding mirror are automatically set. The observer must only specify the camera focus, the choice of slit, filter and/or grism, and exposure parameters (see section Getting started).  The user interface (UIF) consists of a RAMTEK monitor where mouse driven menus and forms are displayed, and a CRT (LU:53) monitor where messages from the system about the instrument are given and commands may be entered.  Parameters are entered by filling in forms on the RAMTEK screen.  Once all optional optical elements are installed by the operation group, according to the observer's request, a setup form is produced. A printout of this form is left in the control room so that the observer can verify the setup and can use it as reference during the night.  The positions in the wheels of filters, grisms,and slits, and the gratings in the housing will be displayed, on the RAMTEK UIF in sofar as it is used in the chosen mode, whenever a setup in that mode is defined.   System Performance ================== The pointing of the NTT is better than 1.5 arcsec rms. Guiding the telescope is normally done by the night assistant by centering a star on one of the two guide probes in the adapter and starting the autoguider.  The camera on the blue arm of EMMI is at F/4 and the detector presently used is a TEK CCD of 1024x1024 pixels, 24 micron in size (ESO No  31).  This gives a scale of 0.37 arcsec/pixel and a field of view of 6.2 by 6.2 arcmin.   Ancillary Data ============== Bias and darks -------------- It is not safe to assume the bias to be always a scalar and therefore it is recommended to take many bias exposures.  It has proven to be extremely difficult to isolate the CCD electronics from electrical interference from components in the NTT adapters/rotators. Therefore to some extent, the EMMI CCDs show pick-up patterns in the electronic background (the bias).  This noise is minimized in  SLOW readout mode, but may be rather strong in FAST readout frames. The patterns are not stable, but change from one exposure to the next, so it is difficult to remove them completely by substracting bias frames.  However, some reduction can be achieved and, therefore, it is recommended to take a good number of bias frames throughout the observing run.  Should strong patterns (i.e. more than a few ADUs) appear on SLOW readout bias frames, call the NTT coordinator (93-50).  Note that spurious patterns are introduced if images are displayed with demagnification factors.  At least one, but preferably more, long (1 hour) dark exposures should be taken to monitor the dark current and any exposure dependent features.  Flat fields ----------- The linearity of CCD No 31 is very good up to 160,000 e/pixel.  The most accurate results for flat fields in broad band imaging are obtained using sky flats. This may be achieved by median filtering of science images, if they are not too densely populated with stars and do not contain very extended objects, or by doing multiple exposures of sparsely populated fields, using spatial offsets. A list of such fields is available in the control room. Another approach is to use morning and evening twilight.  Shutter timing -------------- A time delay of 0.80 seconds has been measured for the shutter in the blue F/4 camera.  Because of the location of the shutter in the optical path, the exposure time over the field is constant and equal to the chosen time plus the average shutter delay.  If critical for your application, it is recommended that you check the shutter timing by either taking exposures of increasing duration on a star, or using one of the internal lamps and a pinhole in the aperture wheel.  Typical count rates ------------------- In blue imaging the efficiency of EMMI is the product of the transmission of the atmosphere, three reflections in the telescope, the transmission of the blue coated optics of mode BIMG, filter, and quantum efficiency of the CCD. The efficiency in B and U was checked for the F/4 camera and TEK CCD No 31 in 1993.  The count rates in e/sec deduced for a 15th magnitude A star with approximately zero colour are U: 2200, B: 16,900 at unit airmass.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:eso-la_silla.ntt.eso_rild,ESO Multi-Mode Instrument: RILD Mode,ESO Multi-Mode Instrument: RILD Mode,"The ESO Multi-Mode Instrument (EMMI) is a multipurpose instrument allowing observations in thevisible wavelengths. EMMI supports wide-field imaging, low-resolution multi-object or long-slit grism spectroscopy, medium-resolution long-slit grating spectroscopy, and echelle spectroscopy, using various detector modes.  The RILD mode, for low-dispersion spectroscopy, is described here.  Low-resolution long-slit spectroscopy is done in the RILD mode by combining one of the grisms with one of the fixed slits (starplates) and, if needed, an order-sorting filter. The grisms cannot be rotated: the achievable wavelength range is fixed for each grism.  Many grisms show a second order contamination, hence the use of an order sorting filter is recommended.  There are six fixed slits available, with widths of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2, 5 and 10 arsec, and each with a length of 8'. The 0.5 arsec slit will cause undersampling of the spectra, except when used in 1 x 1 binning mode, under exceptional seeing conditions.  The orientation of the slit can be adjusted by applying an offset to the rotation angle of EMMI.  Grisms and filters can also be combined to obtain slitless spectra imaged on the CCD. The use of filters in combination with a grism reduces the sky background intensity. It also selects the wavelength region of interest and limits the length of the spectrum, thus reducing crowding. The spectral coverage within this wavelength region depends on the position of the object in the field.  The following table summarizes the Grisms available on EMMI and their characteristics.

Until June 1, 2004 FORS1 was mounted at the Cassegrain focus of Unit Telescope 1 (Antu); after this date it was moved to Unit Telescope 2 (Kueyen) of the Very Large Telescope (VLT) at the European Southern Observatory (ESO).  FORS1 is an all-dioptric instrument for the wavelength range from 330 nm to 1100 nm and provides an image scale of 0.25 arssec/pix (or 0.125 arsec/pix with the high-resolution collimator) in standard readout mode (2x2 binning).  FORS1 has a mosaic of two 2K x 4K E2V CCDs with 15 micron pixels.  FORS1 has the following observing modes:  IMA - imaging OCC - imaging with occulting bars LSS - longslit spectroscopy MOS - multi-object spectroscopy (moveable slits) IPOL - imaging polarimetry PMOS - multi-object spectropolarimetry  The IPOL mode is used to measure linear polarization in imaging mode.  The measurements are perfomed by using a remotely controlled rotatable half-wave retarder plate in front of the Wollaston prism. Rotation of the half-wave plate by steps of 22.5 degrees and corresponding measurements of the intensities of the two rays allow the derivation of the values of the Stokes Q and U parameters and hence the value of the degree of linear polarization and the position angle.

It consists of three filter radiometers that each have a limiting aperture, bandpass limiting filter, silicon photodiode detector, and an electrometer to measure the current in the detector. A fourth detector-electrometer combination that is blocked from receiving any light input is used as a “dark” detector to monitor changes in the thermal and radiation induced background signals. A temperature diode is also included in the EUV instrument. There is also a mechanism to place or remove additional fused silica windows in front of the three science apertures. These filters block the EUV and X-ray sunlight, but still allow longer wavelength light (primarily visible) through into the radiometers.

The detector head houses an optical lens assembly and a Charge Coupled Device detector (CCD). The electronics box contains the CCD driver electronics, the 12-bit Analog to Digital Converter (ADC), camera/rover interface electronics, and a heater resistor that will keep the box above the minimum operating temperature of 218 K. The Hazcams use a broadband visible filter and produce 1024 x 1024 pixel images. Each camera (not including the cover) weighs 245 grams and uses approximately 2.2 Watts of power when the heater is not on. The MSL Hazcam design is identical in design to the Hazcams on the Mars Exploration Rovers with the exception of a more powerful 3.5 W heater on each MSL Hazcam and a protective cover.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Each array viewed the same region of the sky via beamsplitting dichroics. The light passed through both dichroics to the Ks-band array. The first dichroic reflection fed the light to the J-band array. All three optical paths shared the same first element located behind a cryogenic field stop. Each optical path had six other lenses. This set of six lenses was identical for each band. The lenses were composed of water-free fused silica (Infrasil) or calcium fluoride. All lens surfaces were spherical. All optical elements were anti-reflection coated and the integrated optical assembly transmitted ~70% of the incident light. A band-limiting interference filter located near a pupil image established the system bandpass.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:go.epd,ENERGETIC PARTICLES DETECTOR for GO,ENERGETIC PARTICLES DETECTOR,"        The Galileo Energetic Particles Detector is fully described by Williams et al [WILLIAMSETAL1992].   INTRODUCTION        Jupiter possesses the largest planetary magnetosphere in the solar system.  It is the largest in spatial dimension, has the highest trapped particle energies and intensities, has the greatest compositional variety in its major particle populations, displays the largest co-rotational effects and has the largest number of moons within the magnetosphere that provide both strong sources for and losses of the observed particle populations.  These characteristics, uncovered by the Pioneer and Voyager flybys demand an instrument design capable of accommodating the great range in parametric values established by these extremes.        Within the Jovian magnetosphere, the energetic (>=20 keV) particle populations play an important dual role.  First, they represent a major factor in determining the size, shape, and dynamics of the system.  For example, observations of energetic particle intensities and corresponding energy densities show that these populations are important in (1) standing off the solar wind and thereby determining magnetopause position; (2) determining the general magnetic field configuration in the evening magnetosphere and (3) establishing the bulk of the ring current responsible for the magnetodisk configuration of the middle-Jovian magnetosphere.        Secondly the energetic particles play an important diagnostic role in the determination of energization, transport, and loss processes active in the Jovian magnetosphere.  In this role they also provide a remote sensing capability for identifying magnetospheric structures through finite gyroradius effects and for diagnosing remote processes through field-aligned flow, E x B drift, and magnetic drift effects.        The Galileo EPD will provide major extensions to the Jovian energetic particle data base obtained from the Pioneer and Voyager flybys.  For example: (1)  Galileo will be placed into a highly elliptical orbit around Jupiter.  The nominal two-year mission lifetime will allow both a direct measure of time variations in the Jovian magnetosphere and a significantly larger spatial sample of the system than has been possible with the previous flybys. (2) The nominal mission includes several close ( < 1000 km) flybys of the Galilean satellites thereby providing the best opportunity to date to observe details of the satellite/magnetospheric interactions. (3)  The EPD provides the first 4-pi steradian angular coverage for Jovian energetic particles, thereby assuring that the necessary energetic particle measurements will be obtained independent of satellite orientation and magnetic field direction. (4)  The low-energy thresholds of the EPD effectively close the energy gap between plasma and energetic particle measurements that has existed in previous observations and assures that processes thought to operate in that gap will be tested by direct observation.  For example, it has been suggested that the particles powering Jovian aurora are ions of energies <=100 keV/nucl, a composition energy range to be measured by Galileo instrumentation at Jupiter.   EPD OVERVIEW        The EPD instrument is the result of a joint effort between The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL), The Max-Planck-Institute fur Aeronomie (MPAe) and The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Space Environment Laboratory (NOAA/SEL). Proposed in 1976 with initial funds received in late 1977, the EPD was launched onboard the Galileo spacecraft on October 12, 1989.  The MPAe was responsible for the detector heads and three analog circuit boards associated with those heads.  The NOAA/SEL was responsible for the original time-of-flight (TOF) circuitry.  The TOF circuitry employed in the upgraded TOF detector actually flown (and described in the composition measurement system, CMS, section) was the joint responsibility of MPAe and JHU/APL.  The JHU/APL was responsible for all remaining electronics, the scanning motor, the data system, instrument power, structure test, instrument integration, and spacecraft integration.  Calibrations were performed by JHU/APL and MPAe.      The general characteristics of the EPD are listed in the following table:   ------------------------------------------------------------------------       Galileo Energetic Particle Detector (EPD) characteristics ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Mass: 10.5kg   Power: 6W electronics; 4W heaters    Bit rate: 912bps Size: 19.5cm x 27cm x 36.1cm   Two bi-directional telescopes mounted on stepper platform   4pi steradian coverage with 52 to 420 samples every 7 S/C spins (~140s)   Geometric factors: 6E-03 - 5E-01 cm^2/sr, dependent on detector head   Time resolution: 0.33-2.67 s dependent on rate channel   Magnetic deflection, deltaE x E, and time-of-flight systems   Energy coverage: (Mev/nucl) 0.02-55        Z>=1 0.025-15.5     Helium 0.012-10.7     Oxygen 0.01-13        Sulfur 0.01-15        Iron 0.015-11  Electrons   64 rate channels plus pulse height analysis ------------------------------------------------------------------------        The two bi-directional solid-state detector telescopes are the Low Energy Magnetospheric Measurement System (LEMMS) and the Composition Measurement System (CMS).  These detector heads are mounted on a platform and rotated by a stepper motor contained in the main electronics box.  The combination of the satellite spin and the stepper motor rotation (nominally stepping to the next position after each spacecraft spin) provides 4 pi steradian coverage of the unit sphere.  The 0 degree ends of the two telescopes have a clear field of view over the unit sphere and also can be positioned behind a foreground shield/source holder for background measurements and in-flight calibrations.  The 180 degree ends experience obscuration effects in motor positions 4, 5, and 6 caused by the magnetometer boom and foreground shield.      The zero degree end of the LEMMS unit uses magnetic deflection to separate electrons from ions and provides, from detectors A and B, total-ion energy above ~20keV and from detectors E1, E2 and F1, F2 electron spectra above ~15keV.  The 180 degree end of LEMMS uses absorbers in combination with detectors C and D to provide measurements of ions >~16Mev and electrons >~2Mev.      The zero degree end of the CMS telescope employs a time-of-flight (TOF) versus total energy technique to measure elemental energy spectra above ~10keV/nucl for helium through iron.  A sweeping magnet in the entrance collimator prevents electrons with energies <~256keV from entering the system.  TOF start and stop pulses are generated as the incoming ions pass, respectively, through a thin entrance foil and impinge on the detector KT.  Electrons released from the foil and the detector are accelerated and deflected through a series of grids and are detected by the microchannel places, MCP1 and MCP2.  The time difference between the start pulse, MCP1, and the stop pulse, MCP2, is then obtained, along with the ion total energy from KT.  Knowing the ion total energy and its travel time through the system (which gives its velocity), the ion mass is determined.      The 180 degree end of the CMS telescope measures the ion energy loss, deltaE, as the ions pass through detectors Ja and Jb and the ion residual energy E=E(total) - deltaE, as they impact detectors Ka and Kb.  The resulting deltaE and E measurement provides a measure of ion composition for energies >~200keV/nucl.      The planned normal mode of EPD operation is to have both the telescopes powered and to step the stepper platform once each satellite spin.  This will yield a 4-pi scan of the unit sphere approximately every 140s.  Many other scanning modes are available and will be used for special circumstances.  For example, during satellite encounters, the EPD will be configured to scan particular directions such as the expected direction of the magnetic flux tube, the direction of the Galilean satellite wakes as they travel through the Jovian magnetosphere, and the direction of the E x B drift paths.

The S/C spin period is ~20 seconds and the EPD motor moves to a new polar angle every spin. Ground processing converts this time based data stream into displays with 7 polar angles and 64, 32, or 16 azimuthal sectors.  The LRS record mode will still provide this resolution of coverage.   In the LGA mission EPD was allocated bit rates of 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, or 40 bps, depending on S/C TM format. The lowest bit rates will be the most common.   At these low rates the EPD measurements must be sectored on board the S/C, and accumulated for extended periods. The challenge was to design a realizable combination of channels, time and angular resolution that fits the available bit rate and maximizes science return.     EPD LGA Science Mission Design: ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1. Introduction   The EPD collects particle flux measurements from almost the entire 4-pi sphere by making and reporting fairly rapid particle measurements as the spacecraft and the EPD motor platform sweep the EPD sensors through the sky. The instrument simultaneously samples the particle flux in a number of energy ranges, and sorts the particles out by mass, energy, and direction.   It is important to preserve the directional information on the particle measurements, as well as the mass and energy information. While the temporal variations are also important to the science team, they are of lower priority. In considering any new telemetry scheme, therefore, it is necessary to preserve the mass, energy, and direction information.   Ideally, the EPD instrument could adapt to the reduced telemetry allocations by doing on-board data averaging, editing, compression, etc. Unfortunately, the version 1&2 software telemetry formats are time-based, and do not easily support theses types of operations without eliminating the directional information. It will therefore be necessary to redesign the telemetry format such that it is spin-based; such an approach allows data from adjacent spins to be averaged together, thus reducing the bit rate required to send down the results.   It was determined that the EPD already contains sufficient hardware and software resources necessary to handle the new tasks required of it, however the rate channel RAM buffer storage requirements far exceed what could be made available in the instrument. This single result drives most of the interface requirements that will be presented below.   A number of cooperative EPD+CDS processing approaches have been looked at with an eye to keeping as many tasks and storage buffers in the EPD as possible. To generate a useful EPD data set, it will be necessary to transfer raw rate channel data to the CDS, where it will be summed into appropriate sector-based 4-byte counters. These counters will be log-compressed, formatted, and passed on to the CDS telemetry processor at the end of each instrument cycle.     2. Software Versions   The EPD instrument software has undergone a number of changes of the course of the mission development cycle. The original instrument software was finalized in about 1980, and was committed to ROM fabricated by Sandia National Labs. This  software version, which I'll refer to as the 'Version1' software, is still in the flight instrument.   Prior to the original launch date of 1986, a few minor bugs were discovered in the  software, and several small RAM patches were designed to correct the problems. These  patches were tested in SAF during the original integration checkout, but were never flown.   After the Challenger disaster, the EPD hardware underwent a number of major modifications to support the addition of a new CMS TOF sensor. Included in these modifications was the addition of a high voltage power supply. New software was needed to operate the high voltage power supply, reformat the telemetry output, and control enables, etc. The software also included corrections to the minor bugs in the original code. This software version, which I'll refer to as the 'Version2' software, was to be the standard operating code for the 1989 mission. It is important to note that if the REV2 software patch is not loaded, the instrument reverts to the Rev1 (ROM- based) software. In this mode, the instrument performs 99% of its intended functions, with the exception that the high voltage supply (and thus the CMS TOF) can not be used. This mode was used at Venus, Gaspra, and Ida.   The S-band mission will require us to greatly modify the way the EPD collects and formats telemetry. New EPD software must be written to enable the EPD to perform a number of new tasks. This software will work closely with new software in the CDS which will collect and average the EPD rate readouts. I will refer to the combined new real-time mode EPD and CDS software as the 'Version3' version software.   There will be periods during the Galileo mission (such as satellite encounters) when the CDS will collect data at the old, HGA-based rates. After the data will be put on the tape recorded for later playback, the system will revert back to the standard S-band collection scheme. A requirement for the new Version3 software, therefore, is that it be easily backward-compatible. By this I mean that it should be relatively painless to quickly switch from the old HGA-based software to the new Rev3 software.   When the instrument is put back into the record mode, we will want the capability to operate the full instrument, i.e. the CMS TOF and high voltage supply. It would therefore be desirable to have the ability to switch from the Version3 software to the previous Version2 software. It is not clear that we would want or be able to use all of the features that were included in the Version2 software, however. We will therefore modify the previous Version2 software for use with the LGA mission. This version, which I'll refer to as the 'Version4' software, will handle many of the same tasks as the Version2 software, but may not have all the 'bells and whistles' in order to make the code more compact.   To summarize the material above:   EPD Software  Description Version1      Original ROM-based code Version2      Code generated for 1989 HGA mission Version3      New real-time mode telemetry rate code for LGA-based               mission Version4      New record mode telemetry rate code for LGA-based mission     3. Science Background   The EPD instrument combines the output of two fairly independent sensor subsystems, the LEMMS sensor and the CMS sensor. Two types of data are produced by each of these sensors: rate channel data (channel counters) and PHA (single event pulse height analysis) data. The science telemetry is made up of rate channel and PHA data from both sensors.   The EPD science team has evaluated the scientific priorities from the instrument in the context of a telemetry-starved SBAND environment. The minimum spatial and temporal resolution requirements were determined for each measurement; measurements with similar requirements were then grouped together. A strawman telemetry format was then created by trading off the projected telemetry and memory allocations for the EPD vs. The science return from the measurements.   For the Version3 telemetry format, we decided to report all the CMS TOF sensor rate channel measurements and selected PHA events. The LEMMS rate channels measurements were also preserved. None of the CMS Delta-E x E sensor measurements or LEMMS PHA spectral measurements were kept,  however, except for LRS periods.   3.1 Spatial Resolution   The EPD motor was intended to quickly move the EPD sensor view angle between 8 defined positions. These positions, called motor positions (sometimes motor sectors) are numbered from 0 to 7, and are nominally 30 degrees apart. The calibrate position, 0 , is the exception, and is 45  degrees away from position 1.   Unit sphere coverage for the EPD's sensors is provided by combining the EPD motor stepping and the motion of the spacecraft spin. In the original telemetry design, most rate channels were read and reported via telemetry at least 15 times in each motor position (20 seconds). These measurements were repeated in each of the 8 motor positions, yielding 120 spatial measurements per channel across the unit sphere.   Unfortunately, this type of spatial resolution will not be possible in the Version3 software. To create the broader spatial sectors needed to maintain some directional information on the particle fluxes while conserving bit-rate, we divided the spacecraft spin into four 90-degree sectors, and used the motor stepping pattern between positions 0 and 6 (7 will not be used). This reduces the original 120 sectors to only 28 sectors (4 spin sectors x 7 motor positions).   To reduce the bit-rate further, these 28 sectors will be summed together using one of three algorithms. These algorithms will be used to produce sector patterns which we'll call the 'high,' 'low,' and 'omni' spatial resolution channel types. The unit sphere will now be divided into either 17, 7, or 2 'super' sectors; each of these was the result of summing one or more sectors together.   Each of the rate channels will be assigned to use one of these three channel type formats; the more important the channel's data, the higher the resolution it is given.   3.2 Motor Stepping   The EPD motor movement is directed primarily by the motor controller board, and its associated processor hardware and software. The motor controller is a slave to the data system board; its commands are generated by and/or received from the data system, and its status is sent to the data system.   As its name implies, the motor controller board handles all low level motor control functions. It determines direction, stepping pattern, position measurement, etc., and generates the actual motor phase pulses that move the motor. Each time an electrical pulse is sent to the motor, it will take a 'step' of 1.8 degrees. A series of pulses, sent over about 1/2 second, is normally used to move the motor from one motor position to the next.   The overall, high-level timing of the motor, however, is dictated by the data system; it generates motor 'trigger' signals that tell the motor controller when to initiate a motor movement. In the original  design, the motor triggers are sent once every 20 seconds, but this  timing can be altered via the 'motor dwell' command.   The motor trigger should be viewed as a timing synchronization signal, not a command to move. When the motor controller receives the motor trigger, its processor examines what stepping mode it is presently executing. If the motor had been commanded to cease scan or stop at a particular sector, the motor will do nothing in response to the motor trigger; it will initiate a motor movement only if the commanded stepping mode requires one.   In the new Version3 software, the data system will synchronize the motor movement to the spacecraft spin by generating a motor trigger at the  beginning of each spin of the spacecraft. The data system will use the  CDS-supplied AACS spin vector information to determine when a new spin has started. The motor controller interface will remain the same in that it will simply respond to motor triggers using its original software.   The motor system operates in a 'windshield wiper' mode; it rotates 235 degrees in one direction, then reverses itself and goes back 235 degrees in the opposite direction. Within this 235 degree rotational space, there are 8 predefined, discrete motor positions, numbered 0 through 7. In the Record Mode, the motor will visit all 8 positions, moving once every 20 seconds from one position to the next (the actual motor movement requires approximately 1/2 second).   In the Real-time Mode, the motor will only visit 7 of the 8 positions; position number 7 is not used. The motor stepping will be synchronized to the spacecraft spin rate, moving once per spin when the spacecraft spin vector passes through 0. The motor movement synchronization is good to 1/3 second resolution, resulting in approximately 6 degree uncertainty. More information on the Real-time motor movements is included in later sections of this document.   3.3 Temporal Resolution   As stated before, most EPD channels were previously read out once every 4/3 seconds. In the Version3 telemetry format, the channel read outs will vary depending on what the EPD telemetry allocation is. The higher the bit-rate, the higher the time resolution that will be used.   A new EPD data construct, called the EPD science record, will be used to group the science measurements together. A science record will extend over a number of spacecraft rotations; the sectorized rate channel data in the record will be averaged across the multiple spins.   An EPD science record period will always be an integer multiple of EPD cycles, where a motor cycle is defined as 6 EPD motor position steps. Since the EPD motor will be synchronized to move once per spacecraft spin, a motor cycle is 6 equal to spacecraft spin periods. Assuming a nominal spin rate of 3.15 rpm, the nominal spin period is 19.048 seconds. Our minimum science record is one motor cycle (114.29 seconds) and our maximum is 6 motor cycles (685.71 seconds or 11.4 minutes).   Worst-case time resolution chosen to be ~12 minutes (at 5 bps). This should be reasonable--much of the Voyager analysis was done with 15 minute averages. Higher resolution will be available at the higher bit rates. Angular resolution chosen to cover 4 Pie steradians with 1, 6, or  16 measurements (and cal).   As described above, each rate channel is assigned to use one of the three channel type formats. If these assignments were frozen, however, it would not be possible to make good use of the variable bit-rate allocated to the EPD. For this reason, two different mappings of rate channel to channel type assignment will be used. These mappings will be referred to as Channel Map 1 and Channel Map 2. The proposed channel mappings are shown in Tables below. 3.4 Channel Bins   The combination of a rate channel and its channel map will create rate channel 'bins.' The number of bins assigned to a rate channel can be determined by looking at the number of readouts made in the unit sphere for the channel; this is defined by which rate channel type the rate channel is mapped to. To clarify, I'll give an example:   The LEMMS rate channel 'A4' is assigned to the a 'low' channel type under Channel Map 1, and a 'high' channel type under Channel Map 2.  Since a 'low' channel type incorporates 7 readouts across the unit  sphere, there will be 7 bins assigned to A4 when the EPD bit rate allocation dictates the use of Channel Map 1. Similarly, there will be 17 bins assigned to A4 when the EPD bit rate allocation dictates the use of Channel Map 2.   By totaling up the number of bins assigned to each rate channel in the two channel maps, we determine that under Channel Map 1, there will be 167 CMS bins and 189 LEMMS bins, for a total of 356 bins. Under Channel Map 2, there will be a 202 CMS bins and 249 LEMMS bins, for a total of 451 bins.   It is important to remember that the counts that go into these bins are generated by the instrument across many spacecraft spins, and the bins are written to in a quasi random fashion, based on where the spacecraft spin vector is pointing and what motor position the EPD is in. This means that the data contained in these bins must be stored somewhere throughout the science record, not just when a channel is being read.   The EPD rate channel accumulators each contain 24 bits counters, thus a maximum count of 2^24=16,777,216 can be held in each accumulator before it will role-over. If the bin is to be read once every science record, (maximum time of 685.71 seconds long), a 24 bit bin can only handle an average count rate of only about 24K counts/sec. Some of the LEMMS and CMS rate channels should produce counts are rates above 200K per second. For this reason, at least some of the bins must be 4 bytes long to handle the expected range.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:go.gdds,GALILEO DUST DETECTION SYSTEM for GO,GALILEO DUST DETECTION SYSTEM,"         Instrument Overview     ===================     The instrument consists of a 0.1 mm thick gold foil of hemispherical     shape with three grids at the entrance (entrance grid, charge grid,     and shield), as well as an ion collector and channeltron detector.     The maximum sensitive area (for particles moving parallel to the     sensor axis) is 0.1 m**2.  Upon impact the particle produces a     plasma, whose charge carriers are separated by an electric field     between the target and the ion collector.  Negative charges (mainly     electrons) are collected at the target; the positive charges are     collected partly by the ion collector and partly by a channeltron.     The channeltron is used as it is insensitive to electric and     vibrational noise.  See Gruen et al.(1992a) [GRUENETAL1992A] for more     information concerning the instrument.         Science Objectives Summary     ==========================     The objective of the Galileo dust experiment is to investigate the     physical and dynamical properties of small dust particles (10**-16 to     10**-6g) in the Jovian environment.  The parameters to be determined     include the mass, speed, flight direction and electric charge of     individual particles.  Specific objectives are:     - To investigate the interaction of the Galilean satellites with     their dust environment in order to study the relationship between     dust influx on satellites and their surface properties, and to     perform direct measurements of ejecta particles from the satellites;     - To study the interaction between dust particles and magnetospheric     plasma, high-energy electrons and protons, and magnetic fields, to     determine the relationship between dust concentrations and     attenuation of the radiation belts, and to investigate the effects of     the Jovian magnetic field on the trajectories of charged dust     particles;     - To investigate the influence of the Jovian gravitational field on     the interplanetary dust population and to search for rings around     Jupiter.         Instrument Measurements     =======================     Positively or negatively charged particles entering the sensor are     first detected via the charge which they induce in the charge grid     while flying between the entrance and shield grids.  The grids     adjacent to the charge pick-up grid are kept at the same potential in     order to minimize the susceptibility of the charge measurement to     mechanical noise.  All dust particles - charged or uncharged - are     detected by the ionization they produce during the impact on the     hemispherical impact sensor.  After separation by an electric field,     the ions and electrons of the plasma are accumulated by charge     sensitive amplifiers (CSA), thus delivering two coincident pulses of     opposite polarity.  The rise times of the pulses, which are     independent of the particle mass, decrease with increasing particle     speed.  From both the pulse heights and rise times, the mass and     impact speed of the dust particles are derived by using empirical     correlations between these four quantities.        Detector Description    ====================     The sensor consists of a grid system for the measurement of the     particle charge, an electrically grounded target (hemisphere) and a     negatively biased ion collector.  A charged dust particle entering     the sensor will induce a charge in the charge grid, which is     connected to a charge sensitive amplifier.  The output voltage of     this amplifier rises until the particle passes this grid, and falls     off to zero when it reaches the shield grid.  The peak value (Q_p) is     stored for a maximum of 600 microseconds and is only processed if an     impact is detected by the impact ionization detector within this     time.  A dust particle hitting the hemispherical target produces     electrons and ions, which are separated by the electric field between     the hemisphere and ion collector into negative charges (electrons and     negative ions) and positive ions. The negative charges are collected     at the hemisphere and measured by a charge sensitive amplifier (Q_e).     Positive ions are collected and measured at the negatively biased ion     collector with a charge sensitive amplifier (Q_i).  Some of the ions     penetrate the ion collector (which is partly transparent - total     transmission approximately 40 percent), are further accelerated, and     hit the entrance cone of an electron multiplier (channeltron).     Secondary electrons are produced, amplified, and measured by a charge     sensitive amplifier (Q_c).  Other quantities measured are the rise     times of both the positive and negative charge pulses.  The     measurement of the time delay between electron pulse and ion pulse     serves as a means for distinguishing impact events from noise.     Impact events have time delays of 2-50 microseconds, while mechanical     noise has a time delay of milliseconds. These signal amplitudes and     times of a single recorded event are digitized and stored in an     Experiment Data Frame (EDF).       A measurement cycle is initiated if either the negative charge Q_e on     the hemispherical target, or the positive charge on the ion-collector     Q_i, or the positive charge Q_c on the channeltron exceeds a     threshold. Since the hemisphere has a large area which is directly     exposed to interplanetary plasma and high-energy radiation, this may     cause some interference for the Q_e measurement. To avoid this     interference during high activity times, it is possible to switch by     command to a mode in which a measurement cycle is initiated only when     the charge on the ion collector Q_i (small area and not directly     exposed) or channeltron signal Q_c exceeds the threshold.       If more than one event occurs within the transmission time of one     EDF, then these events are counted by several amplitude-dependent     counters. The dead-time caused by the measurement cycles is 5     milliseconds.       The signals from the sensor are conditioned and analysed.  The     microprocessor coordinates the experiment measurement cycle, collects     the buffered measurement data and processes the data according to a     program stored in the memory.       See Gruen et al.(1992a) [GRUENETAL1992A] for more information concerning     the operation of the detector.         Calibration Description     =======================     Impact tests with iron, carbon, and silicate particles were performed     at the Heidelberg dust accelerator facility.  The particles were in     the speed range from 1 to 70 km/s and in the mass range from 1.0E-15     to 1.0E-10 grams.  In addition to the projectile material variation,     calibrations for iron particles with varying impact angles were done.     See [GOLLER&GRUEN1989] for more information.       To obtain calibrations without information about the impact angle and     the composition of an impacting micrometeoroid, a set of curves (one     for each measurement channel) was calculated, which were averaged     over three different materials (iron, carbon, and silicate) and over     the range of relevant impact angles (20 to 53 degrees).  The     measurements were done at different angles with iron particles and at     one fixed angle (20 degrees) with carbon and silicate projectiles.     Difficulties in accelerating glass and carbon projectiles and the low     acceleration rate made it impossible to do tests at more than one     angle.       A computer simulation of the detector exposed to an isotropic     particle flux leads to the result that 50 percent of the particles     hit the detector under an angle of 32 degrees or lower, relative to     the sensor axis.  Its effective viewing cone covers a solid angle of     1.4 sr.  As the target is curved (hemispherical) the impact angle,     measured relative to the target normal at the point of impact, is     generally different from the angle of incidence (relative to the     sensor axis).  The direction of travel of the impacting particle can     not be determined.  From the computer simulation the most probable     impact angle is 28 degrees, the average angle is 36 degrees.  This     information, used with the pointing of the instrument, can be used to     obtain a rough estimate of the particle trajectory.  The particle's     flight path inside the detector was determined to be 20 +/- 5 cm.       There are three possibilities for the determination of a particle's     speed (the rise times and the ratio Q_c/Q_i).  Using all three     measurements and comparing them with the calibration curves, the     speed can be determined with an accuracy of a factor of 1.6. Using     only one the accuracy is given by a factor of 2.       With a known particle speed the mass can be determined from the     charge yields Q_i/m and Q_e/m.  If the speed is known within a factor     of 1.6 and both yields are used for mass measurements the value can     be measured with an uncertainty of a factor of 6.  The main part of     this error is caused by the limited accuracy of the speed     measurement.         Instrument Modes     ================     Different instrument modes exist to alter the instrument's     susceptibility to noise.  These modes are changed by adjusting the     thresholds of the detectors on board the instrument.  The thresholds     are altered by telecommand from Earth.  The threshold levels of the     detectors are included within the dataset.         Onboard Processing     ==================     See [GRUENETAL1995C].       First, the instrument microprocessor, which controls the experiment     measurement cycle, collects the buffered data and processes the data     according to its onboard program. This takes about 5 ms (10 ms for     Galileo after reprogramming in June 1990).  The information on a     single event (dust impact or noise) is contained in an Experiment     Data Frame (EDF) of 16 bytes (i.e. 128 bits).       The instruments are designed to reliably operate under noisy     conditions thereby allowing the reliable extraction of true dust     impacts from noise events. True impacts can be detected at rates of     as low as one per month. This is achieved by raising the threshold     levels of all impact signals individually by telecommand which allows     instrument sensitivity to be adapted to the actual noise environment     on board the spacecraft. Coincidences between the signals are     established which, along with the signal amplitudes, are used to     classify each event.       Each measured event (noise or impact) is classified according to the     strength of its ion signal (IA) into one of six amplitude ranges     (AR=1 to 6). Each amplitude range correspond roughly to one decade in     electronic charge, Q_I. In addition, each event is categorized into     one of four event classes (described by the class number CLN). The     event classification scheme, which defines criteria that must be     satisfied for each class, as it stood before July 14, 1994, is shown.       The abbreviations below refer to EVENT CLASS (CLN), ION AMPLITUDE     (IA), CHANNELTRON AMPLITUDE (CA), ELECTRON AMPLITUDE (EA), ELECTRON RISE     TIME (ET), ION RISE TIME (IT), ION CHANNELTRON COINCIDENCE (ICC), ELECTRON     ION COINCIDENCE (EIC), and noise counters of the electron collector (EN),     ion collector (IN), and the channeltron (CN).     -----------------------------------------------------------------------   Parameters:| CLN=0  |  CLN=1  |       CLN=2        |       CLN=3   -----------------------------------------------------------------------      IA      | IA > 0 |  IA > 0 |       IA > 0       |       IA > SP16   -----------|   or   |    or   |----------------------------------------      EA      | EA > 0 |  EA > 0 |       EA > 0       |       EA > SP14   -----------|   or   |--------------------------------------------------      CA      | CA > 0 |  CA > 0 |       CA > 0       |       CA > SP15   -----------------------------------------------------------------------      ET      |        |         | SP03 <= ET <= SP04 | SP03 <= ET <= SP04   -----------------------------------------------------------------------      IT      |        |         | SP01 <= IT <= SP02 | SP01 <= IT <= SP02   -----------------------------------------------------------------------      EIC     |        |         |       EIC = 0      |      EIC = 0   -----------------------------------------------------------------------      ICC     |        |         |       ICC = 1      |      ICC = 1   -----------------------------------------------------------------------   Noise      |        |         |                    |   counter of:|        |         |                    |      EN      |        |         |                    |      EN <= SP11      IN      |        |         |                    |      IN <= SP09      CN      |        |         |                    |      CN <= SP10   -----------------------------------------------------------------------       Within each class these conditions are connected by logical 'and'     except where noted. Class 0 (CLN = 0) includes all events that are     not categorized in a higher class (typically noise and unusual impact     events - e.g. impacts onto the sensor's internal structure other than     the impact target).  In classes 1 through 3, the criteria become     increasingly restricted so that CLN = 3 generally represents true     dust impact events only. Some of the set point values (SP01 to SP15),     which can be set by ground command, are used in the classification     scheme. Prior to July 14, 1994, the set points were as follows:                           SP01 =  1                         SP02 = 15                         SP03 =  1                         SP04 = 15                         SP09 =  2                         SP10 =  8                         SP11 =  8                         SP14 =  0                         SP15 =  0                         SP16 =  0       The on board classification can be adapted to the in-flight noise     environment by changing the thresholds and classification parameters     (set points) or by adjusting the onboard classification program     through telecommands. Detailed information on noise is mandatory in     order to evaluate the reliability of impact detection for the various     event categories, to minimize the effect on dead-time and to optimize     memory utilization. Such a modification of the on board     classification scheme was done on July 14, 1994 after a detailed     analysis of data from Ulysses [BAGUHLETAL1993] identified a number of     'small' impacts in the three lowest categories. Baguhl et al. deduced     a modified event classification scheme which allowed for a better     discrimination between noise events and real dust impacts:     -----------------------------------------------------------------------   Parameters:  |CLN=0 |      CLN=1    |         CLN=2       |  CLN=3   -----------------------------------------------------------------------      IA        | IA>0 |  IA>0  | IA>0 |   IA>0     | IA>0   |  IA>0   -------------|  or  |--------|------|------------|--------|-----------      EA        | EA>0 |  EA>0  |      |   EA>0     |        |  EA>0   -------------|  or  |--------|------|------------|--------|-----------      CA        | CA>0 |        | CA>0 |            | CA>0   |  CA>0   -------------|------|--------|------|------------|--------|-----------      ET        |      |        |      |            |        | 1<=ET<=15   -------------|------|--------|------|------------|--------|-----------      IT        |      |        |      |            |        | 1<=IT<=15   -------------|------|--------|------|------------|--------|-----------      EIC       |      | EIC=1  |      |   EIC=0    |        |  EIC=0   -------------|------|--------|------|------------|--------|-----------      ICC       |      |        |      |            | ICC=1  |  ICC=1   -------------|------|--------|------|------------|--------|-----------                |      | EIT=0  |      |            |        |      EIT       |      |   or   |      | 3<=EIT<=15 |        | 3<=EIT<=15                |      | EIT=15 |      |            |        |   -------------|------|--------|------|------------|--------|-----------   Noise counter|      |        |      |            |        |   of:          |      |        |      |            |        |      EN        |      |        |      | EN<=8      |        |  EN<=8      IN        |      |        |      | IN<=14     |        |  IN<=2      CN        |      |        |      |            | CN<=14 |  CN<=2   -----------------------------------------------------------------------       The definition of class 3 remained unchanged with respect to the old     scheme. Classes 1 and 2 were divided into two subclasses. With the     modified scheme, noise events are usually restricted to Class 0.     However, Class 0 may still contain good dust impacts, especially in     the higher amplitude ranges. Although noise events are normally     restricted to Class 0, Classes 1 and 2 are also contaminated by noise     in extreme radiation environments [KRUEGERETAL199B].       The above four classes, together with six amplitude ranges,     constitute twenty-four separate categories. Each of these categories     has its own 8-bit accumulator:                             |         |    Class number (CLN)                           |Amplitude|                      IA   |  Range  |  0      1      2      3                     -------------------------------------------                      0- 7 | AR = 1  | AC01 | AC11 | AC21 | AC31                      8-15 | AR = 2  | AC02 | AC12 | AC22 | AC32                     16-23 | AR = 3  | AC03 | AC13 | AC23 | AC33                     24-32 | AR = 4  | AC04 | AC14 | AC24 | AC34                     48-55 | AR = 5  | AC05 | AC15 | AC25 | AC35                     56-63 | AR = 6  | AC06 | AC16 | AC26 | AC36       As long as the respective accumulator does not overflow, each event     is counted even if the complete information is not received on     ground. Generally, the event rate is so low (even in the low     amplitude and low class ranges) that the true increment can be     reliably determined. All categories and corresponding accumulators -     excluding AC01, AC11 and AC02 - contain primarily impact events. Even     in these latter categories, true impacts can be identified and     separated from noise events if the complete data set for an event is     available (Baguhl et al., 1993)[BAGUHLETAL1993].       The on board data processing supports the application of a priority     scheme for the data transmission. Data from events with different     categories are stored in different ranges of the on board memory. The     organization of the memory is particularly important because of its     severely limited transmission rate. Data must be safely stored on     board for long periods of time.       The memory is divided into separate ranges in which various data is     given priority. The A-range of instrument memory stores the six most     recent EDFs - one for each amplitude range regardless of class. The     E/E2 range, graphically depicted below, stores the last 8 (the last     16 after reprogramming in June 1990) events occurring within class 3.     These events satisfy the most stringent constraints and are almost     certainly true impacts. Additional memory ranges F, G, and H were     added to the Galileo memory scheme during reprogramming. The last 8     EDFs in each of these ranges are also stored. Thus, 46 EDFs can be     stored in DDS memory.                 |         | Class number (CLN)               |Amplitude|          IA   |  Range  | 0   1   2    3     -------------------------------------------          0- 7 | AR = 1  | H | G | G | E/E2          8-15 | AR = 2  | F | F | F | E/E2         16-23 | AR = 3  | F | F | F | E/E2         24-32 | AR = 4  | F | F | F | E/E2         48-55 | AR = 5  | F | F | F | E/E2         56-63 | AR = 6  | F | F | F | E/E2         Data Readout Modes     ==================     During most of the interplanetary cruise (i.e. before December 7,     1995) DDS data was received as instrument memory readouts (MROs).     MROs return event data which have accumulated in the instrument     memory over time. The contents of all 46 instrument data frames of     DDS is transmitted to Earth during an MRO. If too many events in a     given range occur between two MROs, the oldest EDFs in that range are     overwritten in the instrument memory and lost.       In April 1996 the spacecraft computer on board Galileo was     reprogrammed (Phase 2 software) which provided a new mode for high-     rate dust data transmission to the Earth, the so-called realtime     science mode (RTS). In RTS mode, DDS data were read-out wither every     7 or every 21 minutes, depending on the spacecraft data transmission     rate, and were usually directly transmitted to Earth with a rate of     about 1 or 3 bits per second.       For short periods around satellite closest approaches, DDS data were     collected with a higher rate at about one minute intervals, recorded     on the tape recorder and transmitted to Earth several days to a few     weeks later. This was known as 'record mode'. Sometimes RTS data for     short time intervals were also stored on the tape recorder and     transmitted later, but this does not change the labeling.       In both RTS and record mode only seven instrument data frames were     read out and transmitted to Earth, rather than the complete     instrument memory. This read out would consist of the six A-range     events and one of the E, F, G, and H range events. The E, F, G, and H     ranges were cyclically permuted so that 40 successive read-out cycles     cover the full range of instrument memory.       All accumulator counters were read out and transmitted (or stored to     tape and transmitted) during each MRO, RTS and record mode read out.     Because of the low data transmission rates required for this     instrument, event rates were unaffected by spacecraft transmission     rates.        Data processing on the ground    =============================     After receiving the partially processed data from the spacecraft, the     following data processing steps are performed on the ground:            (1) instrument health check          (2) generation of accumulator histories          (3) extraction of discrete events          (4) reduction of impact data          (5) generation of data products       The instrument health check involves inspection of instrument house     keeping data such as temperatures, voltages, currents and a check of     the test pulse data. If, for example, the temperature readings are     too high, the heater power level can be set accordingly.       Once per day (during encounter times more frequently) all 24     accumulators are checked and history plots covering appropriate time     intervals for impact and noise events are produced. If excessive     noise is detected then appropriate measures, such as changing the     thresholds or channeltron high voltage by telecommand, can be taken.     Occasionally, tests of different instrument modes are performed in     order to probe the actual noise environment; the instrument     parameters can then be adjusted accordingly.       The extraction of discrete event data, includes the removal of     redundant information, which can occur because of the design of the     instrument's memory, and a completeness check during which all events     that have caused an increment of one of the 24 accumulators are     searched for. Data of these events are put in time order.       The preparation of data products is the final routine step of dust     data processing. A number of separate files are produced which     reflect various stages of data processing.        Instrument Mounting    ===================    The instrument is located on the spinning section of the spacecraft    underneath the magnetometer boom. The sensor axis is offset by an    angle of 60 degrees from the positive z axis (Krueger et al. 1999b    [KRUEGERETAL1999B]). The z axis is the rotation axis of the    spacecraft.  The positive direction is antiparallel to the spacecraft    antenna. During most of the initial 3 years of the mission the antenna    pointed towards the Sun. Since 1993, the antenna usually points    towards Earth.  The Galileo dust detector weighs 4.2 kg and consumes    2.4 W.

GEHRELS(2), and E. C. STONE(1)   1 California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91125, U.S.A 2 NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD 20771, U.S.A.     Abstract. The Heavy Ion Counter on the Galileo spacecraft will monitor energetic heavy nuclei of the elements from C to Ni, with energies from ~6 to ~200 MeV nucl^-1. The instrument will provide measurements of trapped heavy ions in the Jovian magnetosphere, including those high-energy heavy ions with the potential for affecting the operation of the spacecraft electronic circuitry. We describe the instrument, which is a modified version of the Voyager CRS instrument.                                     1. Introduction     The Heavy Ion Counter (HIC) is included on the Galileo spacecraft primarily for the purpose of monitoring the fluxes of energetic heavy ions in the inner Jovian magnetosphere and high-energy solar particles in the outer magnetosphere in order to characterize the ionizing radiation to which electronic circuitry is most sensitive. The measurements performed will also be of scientific interest, since the instrument's large geometry factors and extended energy range will provide spectral information for ions from 6C to 28Ni with energies of ~6 to > ~200 MeV nucl**-1. In this article we will concentrate on Jovian magnetospheric science. We review here previous scientific results concerning trapped high-energy heavy ions, describe anticipated new findings with Galileo, and provide a brief instrument description.                                    2. Previous Results     During the Voyager encounters with Jupiter, it was discovered [KRIMIGISETAL1979A], [KRIMIGISETAL1979B], [VOGTETAL1979A], [VOGTETAL1979B] that a major component of the trapped radiation in the inner Jovian magnetosphere is energetic heavy ions. The dominant heavy species inside ~ 10 R[J] in the MeV nucl**-1 energy range were found to be oxygen and sulfur, with sodium also present. The abundances in the inner magnetosphere indicate that the source of the ions is the surface or atmosphere of Io.   The phase space density of the energetic oxygen and sulfur ions has positive radial gradient (i.e., increasing outward) in the inner magnetosphere [GEHRELSETAL1981], implying that the diffusive flow at these energies is inward. On the other hand, the density of the oxygen- and sulfur-rich plasma in the inner magnetosphere is highest at the Io plasma torus and decreases outward [SISCOEETAL1981]. Barbosa et al. [BARBOSAETAL1984] have proposed that charge exchange in the plasma torus produces fast neutrals which escape to the outer magnetosphere where ~ 0.2% are re-ionized by solar ultraviolet or electron impact and recaptured Some of the newly created ions are subsequently energized by stochastic acceleration caused by magneto- hydrodynamic waves, producing ions with large magnetic moments that adiabatically diffuse inward, some attaining energies in excess of 30 MeV nucl**-1 in the inner magnetosphere.   As the energetic ions flow inward, they are lost from the magnetosphere, presumably by pitch-angle scattering of the mirroring particles into the loss cone (see, e.g., [THORNE1982]). The strength of this loss mechanism determines the rate at which the heavy ions precipitate into the Jovian atmosphere, exciting ultraviolet and X-ray auroral emissions.  At the time of the Voyager encounter in March 1979, it appeared losses due to pitch-angle scattering were occurring at nearly the maximum rate, resulting in the precipitation of ~ 10**24 ions s**-1 above ~70 MeV nucl**-1 G**-1, with an extrapolation down to 10 MeV nucl**-1 G**-1 suggesting the possibility of a loss rate of ~10**26 ions s**-1 and an auroral power of ~10**13 W [GEHRELS&STONE1983].  Major losses are occurring in the magnetic moment (energy) range appropriate to HIC where the total inward flow rate of oxygen ions with magnetic moments greater than several thresholds is given as a function of radial distance (L) from Jupiter.  The number of inflowing ions first decreases inside 15 R[J] and falls off sharply inside 10 R[J].  Only a small fraction of the trapped particles survive to produce the trapped radiation at 5 R[J]. As a result, changes in the rate of pitch-angle scattering can result in significant changes in the flux of particles reaching 5 R[J]. It is therefore important to better characterize not only the flux at 5 R[J], but also the nature and any long-term variability in the loss mechanism operative outside of 5 R[J].                                 3. Anticipated New Results     The HIC instrument should provide new information on the spectra of heavy ions at higher energies than previously possible.  Fluxes at these energies are based on extrapolations of spectra measured at lower energies and as a result are very uncertain.   Measurements with the HIC instrument will significantly reduce the uncertainty in the high-energy fluxes. The energy of a 3070 MeV nucl**-1 G oxygen ion is within the HIC energy range into 5 R[J]. The geometry factor for E > 20 MeV nucl**-1 oxygen ions (inside 8.5 R[J] for 3070 MeV nucl**-1 G**-1 ions) is ~4 cm**2 sr compared with 0.88 cm**2 sr for the Voyager CRS instrument. More importantly, the livetime for measuring  oxygen and sulfur ions with E >= 50 MeV nucl**-1 will be essentially 100% because a polling priority system (see instrument description section) will discriminate against the large fluxes of protons and electrons that dominate the CRS analysis rate. As a result, a flux of only 10**-5 cm**-2 s**-1 sr**-1 should produce 1 analyzed event in 10 hours, the time that Galileo is inside 7 R[J].   The oxygen ions which have >= 100 MeV nucl**-1 at 5 R[J] have >= 10 MeV nucl**-1 at 10 R[J]. Thus, as Galileo makes repeated orbital passes in the vicinity of Europa, it will be possible to monitor the fluxes of particles with M >= 3000 MeV nucl**-1 G**-1 throughout the mission. Such long term information is especially important, since there are a number of reasons why the fluxes might vary. For example, the flux of high-energy ions could be measurably affected by changes in the density of the Io plasma torus which is the source of the escaping neutral atoms and by changes in the solar ultraviolet which re-ionizes the neutrals in the outer magnetosphere. The HIC instrument will measure any time dependence of the energetic heavy ion fluxes and permit correlative studies of any associated changes in auroral emissions or diffusion processes.   The fluxes at 5 R[J] depend strongly on the loss processes occurring inside of ~15 R[J]. It is postulated that the losses are due to pitch-angle scattering of the mirroring particles into the loss cone, and that the rate of scattering is close to the strong pitch-angle diffusion limit in the inner magnetosphere ([THORNE1982], [GEHRELS&STONE1983]). At this limit there is sufficient pitch-angle scattering to refill the loss cone as rapidly as particle precipitation empties it, resulting in a nearly isotropic pitch-angle distribution. Since the HIC detectors will view nearly perpendicular to the spacecraft spin axis, essentially complete coverage of the pitch-angle distribution will be possible. Investigation of any time dependence of the loss process will also be possible as Galileo repeatedly passes through the radial range between 15 and 10 R[J] where the radial profiles indicate that significant losses occur.                             4. Instrument Description     The Galileo Heavy Ion Counter (HIC) consists of two solid-state detector telescopes called Low Energy Telescopes or LETs. Use of these two telescopes over three energy intervals provides the geometry factor and energy range necessary to determine the fluxes of the heavy, penetrating radiation to which solid state memories are most sensitive. Heavy collimation and high discrimination thresholds on all detectors provide the necessary immunity to accidental coincidences from the large proton background. Three-parameter analysis provides additional rejection of background.   Two separate telescopes are included in order to cover a wide energy range while minimizing pulse pile-up through the optimum selection of detector and window thicknesses. The LET E is optimized for the detection of nuclei with energies as high as 200 MeV nucl^-1, requiring thicker detectors. Thick windows protect this system from low-energy proton pile-up, but also exclude lower energy oxygen and sulfur nuclei. The second telescope, LET B, has a substantially thinner window so that it can detect lower energy nuclei (down to ~ 6 MeV nucl^-1), especially in the outer magnetosphere. The properties of the two telescopes are indicated in Table I and discussed below.                                        TABLE I                           Nominal LET parameters ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Detector   Radius      Thickness        Threshold            (cm)        (micro-meter)    (MeV)     ------------------------------------------------------------------------ LB1        0.95           32.1            0.3 LB2        0.95           29.6            0.4 LB3        1.13          421              3.7 LB4        1.13          440              2.0 LE1        0.95           30.4            9.3(1.4)**a LE2        0.95           33.4            2.0(0.3)**a LE3        1.13          463             25(5.0)**a LE4,5      1.66        ~2000            117(23)**a ------------------------------------------------------------------------ **a High gain.     In the LETB telescope ions which penetrate LB1 and LB2 and stop in the thicker LB3 detector are analyzed. Detector LB4 is used in anti-coincidence. (If desired, the command system can be used to allow analysis for ions which penetrate LB1 and stop in LB2, or for ions which stop in LB1 . Also detector LB4 can be turned off.) Lighter nuclei (especially hydrogen and helium) are rejected by 'slant' discrimination with a weighted sum of the signals from the front three detectors,                      SLB = LB1 + 0.42 LB2 + 0.2 LB3     required to be above about 9.6 MeV.   The thin window (25 micro-meter Kapton) serves for thermal control and for protection from sunlight. All detectors are surface- barrier type. An important feature is the use of keyhole detectors for LB1 and LB2, which define the event geometry. The active area of these detectors  excludes the nonuniform edge of the silicon wafer through the use of keyhole- shaped masks during the deposition of the Au and Al contacts.   This telescope is an improved version of the Voyager CRS LETs (Stone et al., 1977) which have demonstrated charge (Z) resolution of 0.1 charge units at oxygen under solar flare conditions (Cook et al., 1980) and 0.2 charge units at ~ 5 R[J], Voyager 1's deepest penetration of the Jovian magnetosphere [GEHRELS1982]. Additional collimation and the thicker window decrease the HIC LET's response to background protons in the Jovian magneto- sphere. The flux of protons in detector L1, for example, should be reduced by at least a factor of 10 from that observed on Voyager 1.   In order to measure the flux of heavy nuclei at higher energies, LE4 and LE5 are each 2000-micro-meter lithium-drifted detectors. The front detectors, LE1, LE2, and LE3, are identical to their LET B counterparts, providing spectral continuity and overlap. The collimator housing is relatively thick to provide background immunity and has a large opening angle to provide a large geometrical factor. The windows are 76 micro-meter Kapton and 254 micro-meter Al.  As in LET B, low charge (low Z) events are recognized and rejected by a slant discriminator,               SB = LE1 + 0.5 LE2 + 0.1 LE3 + 0.04(LE4 + LE5),   where SB must exceed 9.6 MeV to allow analysis.   For intermediate energies, a narrow-angle geometry is defined by LE1 and LE2 for particles stopping in either LE2 or LE3. For the highest energies, where the fluxes are exceedingly small, measurements are made with the wide- angle geometry defined by LE2, LE3, LE4, and the collimator. LE1 is not required but its discriminator is recorded as a tag bit. LE5 distinguishes stopping and penetrating events. The maximum energy observed is determined by the LE2 discriminator threshold. This maximum is ~185 MeV nucl**-1 for oxygen as noted in Table II. To allow detection of penetrating galactic cosmic-ray nuclei at higher energies in the outer magnetosphere, the LET E pre-amplifier gains can be increased by a factor of 5 to 7 by command.   With the exception of spacecraft interface circuitry, all of the electronics were originally part of the Proof Test Model of the Voyager Cosmic-Ray Science Instrument (CRS), and additional detail may be found in Stone et al. [STONEETAL1977B] and Stilwell et al. [STILWELLETAL1979B]. With the adjustment of amplifier gains and discriminator thresholds and the incorporation of thicker detectors, collimators, and windows, it has been possible to develop an instrument which is optimized for the measurement of high-energy heavy ions trapped in the Jovian magnetosphere. Minor modifications to the logic allow the instrument to recognize events of the various types mentioned above, which are summarized in Table II.   Event data are stored in buffers which are read according to a polling scheme which prevents domination of the telemetry by any one type of event. The buffer polling logic cycles through the five buffers listed in Table II, reading out one each minor frame (2/3 s) and stepping to the next non-zero buffer on the subsequent minor frame. If a particular type of event occurs less than 0.3 times per second (i.e., is rare) then all of that type will be transmitted regardless of activity in other event types. If a particular type of event occurs more often than 0.3 times per second, it will be readout at least 0.3 times per second and more of ten if the other event buffers are empty.   Telemetry of counting rates and pulse height analyzed events is rapid compared to the nominal 3 rpm spin rate of the spacecraft; thus pitch-angle distributions of the trapped radiation can be measured. Both telescopes have their axes oriented near the spin plane for this purpose. The time resolution of the HIC is in the range from 2/3 to 2 s, implying an angular resolution in the range from 12 deg. to 36 deg., which is to be compared to the telescope opening angles of 25 deg. in narrow geometry mode and 46 deg. in wide geometry mode.   Many of the functions of the coincidence logic and the buffering/readout scheme can be modified by command to optimize the instrument for changing environments or partial failures. As noted above, commands can also be used to change gain on the LET E pre-amplifiers.

At the end of the collection period, another portion of the program compresses the data into their output format.   The output (before packet headers are added) consists of up to 375 bytes of binary data in two blocks.  A dump of simulated data is attached as Appendix A. For details about packet headers, see MOS-GLL-3-310 [ECR35559], Flight Software Requirements, Appendix, p. 5-47; and 625-610: SIS 2244-05 P2, Instrument Packet File [SIS2244-05].  The present description is of the HIC data only.   The first block, of 143 bytes, contains rate data arranged in a predetermined format.  There are 57 rate ''words'' of 2 1/2 bytes each, and 1/2 byte of filler (0x0) at block's end.  The first byte of each rate word is a counter of the number of times that rate was read out. The rest of the word (1 1/2 bytes) gives the sum of the rate counts from those readouts, in log-compressed form.  The compression scheme is the same as that in the SRD.   Several types of rate are subdivided, i.e., have more than one rate word in the output block.  Each successive rate word within a type represents data taken in a later portion of the collection period.  The 57 rate words appear in the following order:   10 words of DUBL  (''A'' rates, for ten successive time divisions)  6 words of TRPL  (''B'' rates, for six successive time divisions)  6 words of WDSTP (''C'' rates, for six successive time divisions)  6 words of WDPEN (''D'' rates, for six successive time divisions) 10 words of LETB  (''E'' rates, for ten successive time divisions)  6 words of LE1   (''G'' rates, for six successive time divisions)  1 word  of LE5   (''F'' rates, MUXN=10)  1 word  of LE3   (''F'' rates, MUXN=11)  1 word  of LE4   (''F'' rates, MUXN=12)  1 word  of LE2   (''F'' rates, MUXN=13)  6 words of LB1   (''H'' rates, MUXN=10,                                 for six successive time divisions)  1 word  of LB2   (''H'' rates, MUXN=11)  1 word  of LB3   (''H'' rates, MUXN=12)  1 word  of LB4   (''H'' rates, MUXN=13)   (Slant data, from ''F'' and ''H'' rates with MUXN<10 or MUXN>13, are discarded.)   Thus for the longest collection period (50 RIM), we can distinguish ~5-min changes in the DUBL and LET B rates and ~9-min changes in the five rates that have six divisions each.  At higher data rates (collection periods of 25 RIM or 10 RIM), the time resolution is proportionally better.   The second block, of up to 232 bytes, contains event data arranged in a flexible format.  The contents of this block can vary considerably depending on the number and kind of events that were observed.  Events have no time divisions.   The events are divided into fourteen types and kept, during the collection period, in fourteen different arrays.  Each collection array can hold up to 20 or 32 events, depending on type.  The array numbers determine the order in which events are output.  Event types are distinguished in the output block not by absolute position (as are the rates) but by header words.   Each string of event information begins with a one-byte header.  The first half- byte contains the event array number, i.e., the type.  The second half-byte is a counter that gives the number of events in the string for that type, less one; i.e., counter = counts - 1.  If no events were observed for a given type, no string is output.   Each event type has a characteristic word length, so the header also gives the length of the event string.  Each type also has a characteristic meaning assigned to each bit in its word.  For details, see Appendix B.   After all the output events comes an event counter array, which consists of a leading 'f' followed by six numbers of 1 1/2 bytes each.  These show the total number of events counted in the collection period for each of six kinds of event:  DUBL, TRPL, WDSTP, WDPEN, LETB, and null (tag word = 0).   The fourteen event types are distributed among the five non-null kinds as follows:  DUBL, type 9;  TRPL, types 5 and 12;  WDSTP, types 1, 6, 13, and 14; WDPEN, types 7 and 8;  and LETB, types 2, 3, 4, 10, and 11. Counts in this array include ''caution'' events, those whose caution bit in the tag word is set.   When rates are very low, all observed events are output and the event block is very short.  When rates are very high, details of some events will be lost because of the limited size of the output block:  232 bytes will hold only about 60 events plus the counters.   If the event arrays are quite full, the program outputs sixteen events from each type, starting with number one, until it has no more room. For this situation, only events of types 1-5 will be output in detail; the rest will be lost, as in the Appendix A dump.  Since the program outputs the first sixteen events of each type, events from the beginning of the collection period are favored ever more heavily as rates climb.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Appendix A:  hex dump of output block for sparse events (event block short)   ------------------------------------------------------------------------   Bar = first rate counter of each series, or event type's header.  x = filler nybble (always 0x0)   octal      data* address          __ 0000000  8880 8988 1897 8179 8818 9881 8978 1798 8189 8818                      __ 0000024  9781 7988 18ed 7edf d7fd fd7f dfd7 fdfd 7fdf c7fc          __                                   __ 0000050  ed73 1fd7 3dfd 73df d73d fd73 dfc7 3ded 76df d77d                                   __ 0000074  fd77 dfd7 7dfd 77df c77c 8872 a977 3c98 73e9 873e                                               __ 0000120  9773 c987 3e98 73e9 773c 9873 e987 3eed 6b1f d6bd                                   __    __    __    ___ 0000144  fd6b dfd6 bdfd 6bdf c6bd 5e76 b5e6 815d 68b5 d697          __                                   __    ___ 0000170  0f85 20f8 5210 8601 0860 1086 0108 605e 6b05 d6ba          __    x__                               __ 0000214  5d6c 5012 ab9b 9c65 ab9b 9c65 ab9b 9c65 525c 66d5                                __ 0000240  4e5c 66d5 4e5c 66d5 4e62 9cfc f652 9cfc f652 9cfc               __                   x__                   x 0000264  f652 72fc a9af ca9a fca9 a082 bcab 5bca b5bc ab50          __                                             __ 0000310  924c 24c2 f0fb 794c 24c2 f0fb 794c 24c2 f0fb 79c2                                        __ 0000334  3185 a89d 3185 a89d 3185 a89d d217 2670 ca17 2670                      __                               _ 0000360  ca17 2670 cae2 19c3 d8a5 19c3 d8a5 19c3 d8a5 f003                            x 0000404  0060 0c00 6001 17b0     * From Octal Address 0000 to 0216 rate data are provided.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:go.mag,TRIAXIAL FLUXGATE MAGNETOMETER for GO,TRIAXIAL FLUXGATE MAGNETOMETER," The Galileo Magnetometer description comes from the Space Science Reviews instrument paper which is reproduced here with permission from Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordecht, Boston, London (KIVELSONETAL1992). Three appendices to the original article are provided at the end of the description that describe changes to the flight software and data acquisition in the Phase 2 mission (low gain antenna mission), some of the in-flight anomalies that have occurred and their resolutions, and the MAG command dictionary.             THE GALILEO MAGNETOMETER   Abstract   The Galileo Orbiter carries a complement of fields and particles instruments designed to provide data needed to shed light on the structure and dynamical variations of the jovian magnetosphere.  Many questions remain regarding the temporal and spatial properties of the magnetospheric magnetic field, how the magnetic field maintains corotation of the embedded plasma and the circumstances under which corotation breaks down, the nature of magnetic perturbations that transport plasma across magnetic shells in different parts of the system, and the electromagnetic properties of the jovian moons and how they interact with the magnetospheric plasma.  Critical to answering these closely related questions are measurements of the dc and low frequency magnetic field.  The Galileo Orbiter carries a fluxgate magnetometer designed to provide the sensitive measurements required for this purpose.  In this paper, the magnetometer is described.  The instrument has two boom- mounted, three-axis sensor assemblies.  Flipper mechanisms are included in each sensor assembly for the purpose of offset calibration.  The microprocessor controlled data handling system produces calibrated despun data that can be used directly without further processing.  A memory system stores data for those periods when the spacecraft telemetry is not active.  This memory system can also be used for storing high time-resolution snapshots of data.   Introduction   The jovian magnetosphere envelopes the planet in a vast cocoon around which the solar wind is deflected in its outward flow from the sun.  The magnetic field of the planet itself brings order to the plasma contained in the magnetosphere, constraining the ions and electrons to move in orbits imposed by electromagnetic forces.   In the 1970's, four spacecraft: Pioneer 10 and 11, and Voyager 1 and 2 traveled through the magnetosphere of Jupiter and provided information on the properties of the charged particles and the fields within it.  These missions showed that the magnitude of the magnetic dipole moment is 4.3 RJ3 x 10-4 T, or 4.3 x 105 nT at the level of the cloud tops near the equator.  This is an order of magnitude larger than the magnetic field at the terrestrial surface.  As at Earth, the jovian plasma contains ions of solar wind origin and ions of ionospheric origin.  Unique to Jupiter is the large population of heavy ions whose source is the galilean moon, Io; these ions form a torus of relatively high plasma density near Io's orbit but they also diffuse out to form an important component of the plasma present throughout the magnetosphere.  The heavy ions, spun up to corotation velocity by magnetic (jxB) forces imposed by field-aligned currents flowing between the ionosphere and the magnetosphere, carry cross-field currents that distort the magnetic field into a disk-like geometry at large distances.   Although many features of the magnetosphere were identified by the first four spacecraft to make measurements within it, there are still many puzzles.  For example, it is not clear how the plasma, whose ultimate source is Io, is transported through the magnetosphere.  Over large spatial regions, the magnetic field imposes corotation, but it is thought that corotation breaks down at large distances in the evening sector, and possibly more generally when new plasma is added at an unusually large rate.  The system appears to display large scale temporal changes, but it is not clear whether the changes are internally or externally driven and the time scales for changes are not understood.  The Galileo mission will provide new data with which it will be possible to map the jovian magnetosphere, monitor magnetospheric dynamics, and investigate magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling.  The presence of Jupiter's large moons perturbs the plasma, and Galileo spacecraft investigations of the plasma interaction with the satellites will yield information about properties of both the plasma and the moons themselves.  For example, during the flyby of Io it will be possible to determine whether or not Io has an internally generated magnetic field (Kivelson et al., 1979).  By remaining within the magnetosphere for years instead of weeks (as for a flyby mission), the Galileo Orbiter will be able to study the structure and the time variability of the system on both large and small scales.  Finally, the spacecraft will make measurements in the magnetotail near the midnight meridian where it may be possible to find evidence of a planetary wind flowing away from Jupiter.   The lengthy (six year) interval of interplanetary cruise will also provide opportunities for carrying out scientific investigations.  During the flyby of Venus in 1990, particles and fields instruments on the spacecraft will acquire data of great value to the study of the cloud- covered planet.  The magnetometer will, in particular, provide data on the temporal variations of the solar wind that will be studied in conjunction with data from the Pioneer Venus Orbiter to provide insight into the time constants for transport of plasma and fields through the ionosphere of Venus.  Studies of pick-up ions and of the electromagnetic signals from lightning on Venus will also be carried out.  During the flybys of Earth whose magnetic properties are well-known, the accuracy of the instrument measurements will be assessed and data will be available for coordinated studies with spacecraft operating in Earth orbit.  During the interplanetary cruise period, the solar wind will be monitored.  Galileo measurements will provide a valuable baseline for the study of the large scale structure and evolution of the solar wind.  For this purpose, comparison with the data of the Ulysses spacecraft which will be in the solar wind at different distances and latitudes will be of special interest.   For all of these science objectives, the measurements of the magnetic field and of its low frequency variations are fundamental.  In addition to providing data of direct importance for scientific investigations, the magnetometer performs a critical service function, providing the reference direction essential to the meaningful analysis of the plasma and energetic charged particle measurements.  As the interpretation of all fields and particle measurements relies on knowledge of the magnetic field direction and/or magnitude, it is essential that physically meaningful data from the magnetometer be available without delay following the transmission of data from the spacecraft.   To develop the magnetometer instrument and a data-processing system that provides scientifically useful data, and to carry out scientific investigations based on the data, a team of experts has been assembled.  Table I lists the principal team members and their responsibilities.   The magnetometer has been designed to provide highly accurate and stable measurements of field vectors over an exceptionally broad dynamic range from the low values characteristic of the distant solar wind and the distant magnetotail (~0.1 to 1 nT) to values larger than the largest anticipated (~6x103 nT) near closest approach to Jupiter. So that small perturbations can be measured with great accuracy, the stray field of all spacecraft systems were constrained to produce less than 0.1 nT magnetic perturbations at the outboard sensor.  Knowledge of sensor orientation will be better than 0.l degrees.   The design of the magnetometer on the Galileo Orbiter incorporates several innovations that will enhance the scientific value of the measured data.  In particular, the Galileo magnetometer can provide calibrated data in 'despun coordinates' using on-board data-processing.  Such data can be used by investigators immediately upon receipt without further delay for data analysis.  The magnetometer also provides for storage of time-averaged data.  Thus, even during intervals when the spacecraft is not transmitting data to Earth, a complete record of magnetic field data will exist.  In addition, the instrument was designed and built to meet standards of signal fidelity and reliability as strict as any ever previously imposed on a spacecraft magnetometer.   The design of the Galileo magnetometer, therefore, presented many challenges.  The requirement of high sensitivity is difficult to achieve on a complex spacecraft.  Reliability, essential because of the prolonged duration of the mission with a six year cruise preceding the beginning of the two- year mission, posed additional problems.  Special requirements on the data coverage and format required development of a new approach to data-handling capabilities as noted above.   Critical Aspects of the Instrument Design   The design challenges described in the introduction were met in a variety of ways.  We chose to fly a boom-mounted dual triaxial fluxgate magnetometer with ring core sensors in a flipper assembly.  The electronics unit housed within the spacecraft contains the drive and sense electronics of the sensors, analogue-to-digital converters, a microprocessor, and power conditioning and control circuitry.   The sensors in each triad are oriented so that one is closely aligned along the spin axis of the spacecraft and two sensors lie with orthogonal orientations in the spacecraft spin plane.  The individual sensors contain drive and sense coils surrounding a magnetically permeable core. Currents in the drive coils drive the permeable core into saturation twice during each drive cycle, symmetrically positive and negative.  An external field breaks the symmetry of the periodic core saturation, and sense coils detect the resultant harmonics of the drive frequency.  The amplitudes of the even harmonics are proportional to the component of the ambient magnetic field along the axis of the sense coils.  The instrument senses the second harmonic signal, i.e. the harmonic of largest amplitude.  A feedback current that nulls the external field is applied to a coil around the sensor so that the core operates in a zero field condition.  Thus, the amplitude of the feedback current is proportional to the component of the external field along the sensor axis.  The data system senses the analogue voltage proportional to the feedback current and converts it to a digital signal which is transmitted to earth.   We chose a fluxgate magnetometer because of its low power and its robustness, as well as because our laboratory has had experience on many missions with successful fluxgate operation.  The ring core sensor was chosen because of its proven stability and low noise.  The flipper assembly was included so that the sensor along the spin axis can periodically be rotated into the spin plane where its zero level can be checked.  This feature also offers some redundancy.  If the sensor along the spin axis were to cease operation, one of the two sensors could be rotated 9Oo to replace it.  Then the three vector components could still be measured, albeit only once per spin period.   The need for extreme sensitivity was recognized not only in the instrument design but also in the design of the spacecraft which has a long boom to isolate the primary set of sensors from the magnetic fields generated by the complex spacecraft and its subsystems.  A second set of sensors located 1/3 of the way down the boom was incorporated to assist in the identification of spacecraft fields. Spacecraft fields will decrease in magnitude with distance from the spacecraft and will often be related to specific spacecraft activities.  Such magnetic fields can be characterized to first order by using data from both the inboard and outboard sensors if it is assumed that the field sources are localized dipoles; the data can then be corrected by removing the contributions of locally-generated fields.   The sensitivity of the magnetometer is needed not merely to measure small magnetic fields but also to measure small variations of the field in a large background magnetic field.  This requirement cannot be met with an instrument that has low fractional resolution in any one range but many operating ranges; instead the instrument must have both a large dynamic range and high resolution.  This need was met by using a high precision A/D converter with l2-bit digitization and l5-bit accuracy.  Averaging data with this accuracy prior to telemetry increases the effective resolution of the measurements.  Our careful plans for achieving high sensitivity could be frustrated by the presence of significant sources of oscillating spacecraft fields in the bandwidth of the magnetometer.  A careful program of magnetic testing, shielding, compensation and proper cable design for the entire spacecraft was undertaken to insure spacecraft magnetic cleanliness and thus to preserve magnetometer sensitivity.   The requirement for extreme reliability was met in several ways.  Of course, the highest reliability parts were used and to the extent possible, the circuitry is insensitive to single part failures.  The use of separate inner and outer sensor assemblies adds some redundancy and so does the flipper, as mentioned above.  In addition to guarding against failure, one also has to be aware of changes in instrument operation.  As the spacecraft spins, the gains and relative phases of the sensors in the spin plane can be intercompared.  The flipper can be used to bring the spin axis-aligned sensor into the spin plane so its gain and phase can also be determined.  An internal calibrate signal referenced to the instrument's A/D converter is also included.  This signal reveals any changes in the operation of the analog portion of the magnetometer.  The pointing of the sensors may change during the mission because the sensors are mounted on the end of a very long boom whose orientation may be temperature sensitive and may be affected by spacecraft maneuvers.  Corrections for such changes can be made by using the clearly measurable magnetic signal produced by a fixed coil (called the MAG Cal Coil) mounted on the side of the spacecraft at the end of the boom, as we discuss in a section on instrument calibration.   The requirements of reliability and sensitivity motivated the design of the analog portion of the instrument as described above.  The design of the digital portion of the magnetometer was equally challenging.  In many respects the design problems are similar to those found in building a high fidelity sound system.  Signal fidelity must be preserved.  To preserve the signal, two aliasing problems must be addressed before the signals are transmitted. First, signals outside the telemetry bandwidth, as given by the Nyquist frequency (half the sample rate), must not enter the analog to digital converter.  This is accomplished by analog filtering before digitization.  Secondly, on a spinning spacecraft, signals in the ambient medium polarized clockwise and counterclockwise about the spin axis are detected at different frequencies. Depending on signal conditioning in the telemetry process, the amplitude and phase relationship of these two circular components of a single ambient signal can be altered.  We minimize this problem by on-board despinning.   The service function of the magnetometer requires that pertinent data be readily available to other experimenters. Our solution is to calculate physically meaningful data on- board the spacecraft and put those data into the telemetry stream.  As mentioned above, to preserve signal fidelity we decided to despin our data on-board, so the high time- resolution despun data required by other spacecraft instruments are readily available.  We note that in order to obtain accurate despun data, the instrument operation must be monitored carefully and calibration constants in the instrument memory updated as necessary.  We also average the despun vector data over approximately 30 second intervals and transmit this information in the subcommutated data. When these data arrive at Earth, they can be immediately displayed and used by all experimenters without further computer processing.  This feature supports rapid analysis of the data both for mission planning purposes and for public information purposes.   Finally, the scientific requirement for continuous data in the face of possible intermittent spacecraft tracking led us to store 200 vectors of averaged data for later transmission.  The available storage registers also permit us to use the full bandwidth of the magnetometer to store limited intervals (7 seconds per hour) of 30 samples per second data that we call snapshots for later transmission. The snapshot memory can store 210 vectors.   In short, the design requirements for the Galileo mission were met with the development of a very sophisticated magnetometer with redundancy, cross-checks, internal computational power and data storage.  The magnetometer has its own digital and analog electronics and power supplies, located in electronics bay number three of the Orbiter.  It is the two flipper assemblies and their ring core sensors that are mounted on a boom or 'astromast' which is deployed from a canister mounted on the science boom.  Below we describe in more detail these various subassemblies, the instrument modes, calibration methods, and the on-board data processing.   Sensors   The basic sensors are ring core fluxgate sensors similar to those described by Gordon and Brown (1972).  Each sensor assembly contains three orthogonally mounted fluxgate sensors and a flipping mechanism.  The flipper mechanism rotates two of the sensors so that the non-spinning sensor parallel to the spacecraft spin axis may be exchanged with one of those mounted in the spin plane of the spacecraft. As mentioned above, such an exchange of sensor positions provides data for determination of the offset of the sensor parallel to the spacecraft spin axis.   The flipping mechanism is similar in design to that developed at NASA Ames Research center and used on Explorer 35, Pioneer 9, ISEE 1 and 2, and UK-AMPTE.  The mechanism uses electrically heated bi-metallic springs and a series of levers to rotate the sensor shaft by 9Oo and back again.   The outboard sensor, mounted at the end of a deployable boom, is located 11.03 meters from the spacecraft spin axis. The inboard sensor is mounted on the same boom at a distance of 6.87 meters from the spacecraft spin axis.   The outboard sensors have dynamic ranges of +32 nT and +512 nT.  The inboard sensors have dynamic ranges of +512 nT and +16,384 nT.  The magnetometer to be operated, i.e. inboard or outboard and the desired dynamic range are selected by commands from the earth.   Electronics   The electronic system is constructed of semiconductor circuits that will withstand the radiation environment of the Jovian magnetosphere.  The analog circuits are constructed on double-sided printed circuit boards with plated-through holes.  The data system is constructed on planar stitchwire circuit cards.  The electronic circuit cards are mounted on a standard subchassis shelf which is mounted in the Galileo electronic bay.  The physical characteristics of the system are given in Table II.   The electronics unit contains an analog circuit board for each of the six fluxgate sensors.  These circuits provide sensor excitation currents, amplification, filtering, and second harmonic detection.  The magnetometer circuits are somewhat similar to those used for the Pioneer Venus Magnetometer, reported by Snare and Means (1977).  Changes were made to adapt the circuits to radiation-tolerant semiconductors and to reduce power consumption.  The output of each circuit is an analog voltage that is linear with the measured magnetic field at the sensor.  The data system contained in the electronics unit is microprocessor controlled.   The central processor (CPU), read only memory (ROM) and the random access memories (RAM), form a standard configuration microprocessor system using the 1802 family of integrated circuits.  The hardware multiplier is a separate logic circuit that performs 8 bit multiplications at a high rate thus enhancing the capability of the microprocessor to process data rapidly.  The flipper control, analog power control, and internal calibrate circuits are switches that are set by the microprocessor in response to ground commands.  The power regulator and memory 'keep alive' circuit are power conditioning circuits that receive power from the spacecraft's alternating current power bus.  The multiplexer, analog to digital converter (MUX-ADC) collects analog data under microprocessor control from the magnetometer circuits and from internal monitors of voltage and temperatures.   Magnetometer Commands and Modes of Instrument Operation   Commands can be sent to the spacecraft to control instrument operation.  Table III lists the commands and the frequency with which routine commands will be sent.  Interactive commands are those that affect other subsystems on the spacecraft whereas non-interactive commands are internal to the MAG subsystem.  Critical commands are those which select either the inboard or outboard sensor to make the measurements and determine whether the high gain (low range) or low gain (high range) measurements are desired.  These selections are made by specific command, not selected automatically, in order to avoid a situation where changes in instrument mode are made in the middle of an important measurement.  The selection of optimal averaging or snapshot mode determines which sort of data will be stored in the instrument buffer (see the discussion of these modes in the section on data processing).  The memory load provides an updated table for the coordinate transformation that converts measurements into absolute field vectors in a specified orthogonal coordinate system.  The remaining commands are related to special procedures that give the parameters needed to convert measurements into absolute field values in a known coordinate system.  They are discussed in the next section.   The instrument processes data in two ways.  In normal operation, the data processor demodulates the data to remove the effect of spacecraft spin and resolves it into an orthogonal system before transmitting the averages to the spacecraft data system.  This process is described in greater detail below.  Alternatively, direct measurements from each sensor can be sampled and averaged in even increments of time for transmission to the spacecraft data system.  The latter method would require `despinning' of the data on the ground and would be used only as a backup procedure or for instrument calibration as discussed below.   Determination of Instrument Offsets, Sensor Orientation and Gain   The internal calibrate signals drive prescribed currents through internal coils around the sensors and are used to determine instrument gain.  In addition, the measurements must be corrected for slight misalignment of the sensors from the nominal orthogonal orientations.  For this purpose, the data are used without despinning.  A small amplitude modulation at the spacecraft spin period of the field in the sensor nominally aligned with the spin axis indicates misalignment.   The measurements can readily be corrected to remove the oscillatory signal and obtain the true spin-axis component of the ambient field.  Sensors precisely in the spin plane will record fields modulated at the spacecraft spin frequency.  If offsets have been corrected and stray spacecraft fields are negligible, such signals average to zero over integral numbers of spins.  Any non-vanishing average field in the sensors nominally in the spin plane can be attributed to the rotation of spin plane sensors out of the spin plane.  By confirming that this spin average is proportional to the component of B along the spin-axis, it is possible to confirm that corrections for offsets and stray fields from the spinning part of the spacecraft have been made properly.  The data can then be corrected to yield the spin plane components of the ambient field.  If the sensors in the spin plane are perpendicular to one another, the signals are in quadrature.  Misalignment within the spin plane results in phase shifts.  They can be readily identified and the data further corrected.  The procedure outlined here provides components of the field along three orthogonal directions, but the absolute orientation of the axes in the spin plane remains uncertain.  The remaining uncertainty is removed by measurement of a reference signal that identifies a direction within the spin plane.  The signal is produced by a coil rigidly mounted on the spacecraft.   The MAG calcoil (MCC) is mounted at the center of the lower (+z) edge of the boom with its axis aligned with the center line of the boom axis.  It is a 20inx18in roughly rectangular coil of 117 turns.  During MAG Cal Coil calibrations, the coil is driven at one of several selected frequencies with a peak-to-peak amplitude of 4.5 nT; (at 0.5 and 0.75 Hz the signal is a square wave, and at 1.5 Hz it is switched on for 2/3 of each cycle).  Because the frequency is known, the signal can be identified even if the field is not entirely quiet.  The flexible choice of frequency allows for the possibility of noise sources on the spacecraft that may make it undesirable to operate in certain frequency bands.  All else being equal, higher frequencies are desirable because natural background noise falls off with increasing frequencies.  The MCC signal defines a reference direction in space, thus providing the required information to allow the sensor orientations to be well constrained.   The above procedure must be carried out for each sensor triad and for both flip positions of the sensor triad.   Fields produced by systems mounted on the despun part of the spacecraft cannot readily be differentiated from ambient fields.  A special procedure has been designed to permit measurements of the magnetic signal of the despun portion of the spacecraft.  Starting in dual spin mode, the relative spin rate of the despun portion of the spacecraft is gradually reduced until the spacecraft is in all-spin mode and the procedure is reversed until the spacecraft is once again in the dual spin mode.  The procedure takes approximately four hours.  The procedure is initiated by the constant slew command and will be carried out once per orbit at Jupiter.   Finally, offsets in the instrument itself can be identified by measurements made in the known field of the Earth's magnetosphere.  This will be possible during the initial post-launch period and during the two subsequent flybys of Earth.  Standard methods of identifying offsets through statistical analysis of tangential discontinuities in the solar wind will also be used.   On-board Data Processing   The system uses a 12 bit analog-to-digital converter that has been trimmed such that each bit is accurate to at least 1/4 of the value of the least significant bit.  The data, sampled at 30 samples/s, are averaged to provide l6-bit words; tests have demonstrated that these words are accurate to the l5th bit.  This filtering is performed by the microprocessor system using a recursive filter.  The recursive filter algorithm is of the form,                 Oi = Oi-1 - K Oi-1 + K Ii                    (1)     where Oi, is the value calculated at measurement i and Ii. is the value read in at measurement i.  The value of K is set at 1/4 for the filter.  This filter gives a transfer function of the form,                                  pOc             T(f) =      ---------------------            (2)                       (1 + pOc) - exp(-ipf/fn)     The relationship of K in equation 1 to Oc of equation 2 is given by the  expression,                               pOc                     K =    ---------                     (3)                          1 + pOc   where Oc = fc/fn, and fn = Nyquist frequency = DT/2, fc = the filter corner frequency and DT is the data sampling interval, (1/30)s.  Next the data are corrected by subtracting the sensor offsets from the data and multiplying the data by a coordinate transformation matrix.  This matrix contains sensor gain and pointing information.  The correction routine yields accurate data at 3 vectors each 2/3 second in true spacecraft coordinates. The information for the corrections, i.e. offsets and matrix values, is computed on the ground and sent via the command system as a direct memory load to the microprocessor memory.   To obtain magnetic field data in inertial (I) coordinates, the data are despun by multiplying the spinning spacecraft (sc) Bx and By by sine and cosine functions generated from spacecraft roll information.             BxI = Bxsc cos q - Bysc sin q                 (4)             ByI = Bxsc sin q + Bysc cos q                 (5)             BzI = Bzsc                                    (6)   The angle q, the spacecraft roll angle, is measured from the projection onto the spacecraft spin plane of a southward pointing vector normal to the ecliptic plane.  Therefore, in inertial coordinates positive BxI points south, normal to the ecliptic plane, positive ByI lies in the ecliptic plane in the sense of Jupiter's orbital motion and positive BzI is in the anti-earth direction.  The spacecraft coordinates are defined with the spin axis +z pointing in the anti-earth direction, the magnetometer boom is the +y axis and the +x axis completes the right hand triad as shown in Fig. 2.   The main data output, i.e. 3 vectors, each 2/3 second, may be commanded to be either in spacecraft coordinates or to be despun data in inertial coordinates.   The despun data are again filtered, and 2 vectors each minute are provided in the subcommutated data.  These subcommutated despun data are provided continuously, even when the main instrument output data are provided in spacecraft coordinates.   For periods of up to a week during the cruise mode on the journey to Jupiter, the data system may not be collecting data from the science instruments.  During this time, the magnetometer will be left on.  The despun data will be averaged over times longer than the basic 30 second intervals and stored in memory.  The averaging constant, K in equation 1, can be set by a command such that the memory will contain time and attitude information in addition to 200 evenly spaced data points for the period between telemetry readouts.  This mode of operation is referred to as the optimal averaging mode.   The instrument memory can alternatively be used for recording high speed data at 30 samples per second.  This mode, called the snapshot, will be used for trying to capture transient events such as shocks or to increase the Nyquist frequency of the magnetometer measurements in order to provide a continuous spectrum of plasma waves from DC to frequencies that overlap the lowest PWS frequency band.  The snapshot data come from the output of the digital averager at 30 samples per second.  By inverting the operation of equation 1, the original unfiltered input data can be retrieved.  For the snapshot mode, the time interval separating digitized values of x, y and z data is greater than or equal to 200 microseconds and the time lapse between successive samples of any axis is 33.3 milliseconds.  The buffer memory which contains 210 48-bit vectors and a time record is continuously read out at 16 words per minute. This memory readout appears in the subcommutated data.   Data Format   The data format contains three vector sets of x, y, z samples and a subcommutator word.  Each word is 16 bits in length and the readout provides 160 bits each 2/3 of a second for a total readout of 240 bps.  The time interval between the first and second, and second and third vectors is 233 milliseconds.  The time interval between the third vector and the first vector of the next minor frame is 200 milliseconds.  Because of odd timing intervals, this slight asymmetry of sampling could not be avoided.  However, a method of correcting for the non-uniform sampling of the data has been devised to remove the undesirable features of non-uniform sampling when necessary for refined analysis.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:go.nims,NEAR INFRARED MAPPING SPECTROMETER for GO,NEAR INFRARED MAPPING SPECTROMETER,"     Instrument Overview   ===================     The Galileo Near Infrared Mapping Spectrometer is described by     Carlson et al, 1992 [CARLSONETAL1992].  A major subset of the     instrument description in the reference appears on all NIMS CDs in     the [DOCUMENT.NIMSINST] directory.       NIMS is an imaging spectrometer capable of obtaining measurements in     the 0.7 to 5.2 micron region.  The spectral resolution is .0125     microns at wavelengths below 1 micron, and .0250 micron at     wavelengths above 1 micron.  The instantaneous field of view is     approximately 0.5 x 0.5 milliradians.  Instrument cycle times vary     from about 1/60 second to 8 2/3 seconds.       The instrument has 17 detectors, permitting 17 near-simultaneous     measurements which are spaced approximately evenly across the     wavelength region.  The dispersion element is a dual-blaze grating     which may be stepped to obtain additional 17 wavelength sets, with     small wavelength offsets from previous measurements.  Various     grating step sizes and initial grating offsets are possible.  For a     nominal instrument grating cycle (12 steps), the instrument can     measure 204 wavelengths across the 0.7-5.2 micron region in 4 1/3     seconds.  There are four commandable gain ranges for all detectors     except the last three, which have automatic gain ranging with two     gains.       The instrument acquires spatial information by utilizing motions of     the spacecraft scan platform, 'pushbroom imaging',  and motions of     a secondary mirror.  The secondary mirror moves in a direction     perpendicular to the mounting plate and sweeps out 20 pixels     yielding an effective field of view of 10 milliradians over the     mirror sweep time (1/3 second).  The order of acquisition is     detector (17 at a time), mirror position (20, alternately down and     up), grating position (0 to 24 steps).

The plasma instrumentation (PLS) for the Galileo Mission comprises a nested set of four spherical-plate electrostatic analyzers and three miniature, magnetic mass spectrometers. The three-dimensional velocity distributions of positive ions and electrons, separately, are determined for the energy-per-unit charge (E/Q) range of 0.9 V to 52 kV. A large fraction of the 47 pi-steradian solid angle for charged particle velocity vectors is sampled by means of the fan-shaped field-of-view of 160 deg, multiple sensors, and the rotation of the spacecraft spinning section. The fields-of-view of the three mass spectrometers are respectively directed perpendicular and nearly parallel and anti-parallel to the spin axis of the spacecraft.  These mass spectrometers are used to identify the composition of the positive ion plasmas, e.g., H+, O+, Na+, and S+, in the Jovian magnetosphere. The energy range of these three mass spectrometers is dependent upon the species. The maximum temporal resolutions of the instrument for determining the energy (E/Q) spectra of charged particles and mass (M/Q) composition of positive ion plasmas are 0.5 s.  Three-dimensional velocity distributions of electrons and positive ions require a minimum sampling time of 20 s, which is slightly longer than the spacecraft rotation period. The two instrument microprocessors provide the capability of inflight implementation of operational modes by ground-command that are tailored for specific plasma regimes, e.g., magnetosheath, plasma sheet, cold and hot tori, and satellite wakes, and that can be improved upon as acquired knowledge increases during the tour of the Jovian magnetosphere.  Because the instrument is specifically designed for measurements in the environs of Jupiter with the advantages of previous surveys with the Voyager spacecraft, first determinations of many plasma phenomena can be expected. These observational objectives include field-aligned currents, three-dimensional ion bulk flows, pickup ions from the Galilean satellites, the spatial distribution of plasmas throughout most of the magnetosphere and including the magnetotail, and ion and electron flows to and from the Jovian ionosphere.     1. Introduction     Although the first direct detection of the presence of plasmas in the vicinity of Io's orbit was reported by Frank et al. (1976) with measurements from the plasma analyzer on Pioneer 10, the first definitive measurements of Jovian magnetospheric plasmas were acquired during the Voyager flybys. The Voyager plasma observations were used to define the required capabilities for the Galileo plasma instrumentation. Briefly we summarize here the plasma domains of the Jovian magnetosphere. This information is largely taken from the review by Belcher (1983). For more recent work the reader is referred to further analysis of the torus ions (Bagenal, 1985; Bagenal et al., 1985), the torus electrons (Sittler and Strobel, 1987), and the middle magnetosphere (Sands and McNutt, 1988). Measurements of medium-energy charged particles, E approx. > 30 keV, are summarized by Krimigis and Roelof (1983).   The heart of the Jovian magnetosphere is the great torus of plasmas that encompasses the orbit of Io. This torus is fed by the ionization of neutral gases from Io's atmosphere and may respond to the sporadic injection of gases from this moon's volcanic activity. The composition of the ion plasmas in this torus is rich in heavy ions, e.g., S+, O+, S2+, O2+, and Na+. The plasma torus is divided into two regimes, cold torus inside Io's orbit and a hot torus at greater Jovicentric distances. The maximum ion densities, ~ 3000 cm**-3, are located near Io's orbit. The ion temperature decreases severely from ~ 40 eV at 6 RJ (Jovian radii) to ~ 1 eV at 5 RJ. This temperature decrease is due to radiative cooling. Ion temperatures in the hot torus at radial distances ~ 6 to 8 RJ are in the range of 40 to 100 eV. The electron temperatures can be described in terms of a two-temperature Maxwellian distribution, i.e., a cold and hot distribution. At the inner edge of the torus the electron temperatures decrease to ~ 0.5 eV with decreasing radial distances whereas the cold electron temperatures beyond ~ 6 RJ are typically ~ 10 to 100 eV. Characteristic temperatures of the hot electron velocity distributions are ~ 1 keV and the number densities are less than those for the cold electrons. The torus plasmas corotate with the planet. The corresponding corotational energy of an S+ ion is 960 eV at equatorial radial distance 6 RJ. The deflection of plasma bulk flow near the Io flux tube is consistent with that expected for incompressible flow around a cylinder and is evidence for an Alfven wave associated with the plasma flow past Io. The estimated current in the Io flux tube is ~ 3 x 10**6 A, presumably carried in large part by electrons.   At distances beyond the plasma torus, > 10 RJ, a plasma sheet extends to the dayside magnetopause. At 15 RJ the typical thickness of the plasma sheet is ~ 2 RJ. These plasmas are observed to corotate more-or-less rigidly with Jupiter's rotational motion to radial distances of about 20 RJ. At distances of 20 to 40 RJ this azimuthal bulk speed of the plasma is less than that expected from rigid corotation by factors of 2 or  more. Beyond 40 RJ the plasmas are again observed to rigidly corotate  at frequent times as inferred from measurements with the medium-energy charged particle detector. The corotational energy of an S+ ion at 40 RJ is 43 keV. Whereas the density of the hot electrons is only ~ 1% of the total density at 8 RJ, the hot electron density is similar to that for the cold electrons at 40 RJ. Ion temperatures are also higher in the plasma sheet relative to those in the torus, ~ 20 to 40 keV at radial distances 30 to 100 RJ.  Plasma densities in the plasma sheet are ~1 to 10 cm**-3 at 10 to 20 RJ and vary from ~10**-3 to 1 cm**-3 at larger radial distances. Above and below the plasma sheet the densities can be as low as 10**-5 to 10**-4 cm**-3.   Beyond radial distances of 130 R, in the dawn side of the Jovian magnetosphere the ion bulk flows become generally anti-sunward with a strong component along directions that are radially outward from the planet. This region was detected with the medium-energy charged particle detector and is called the magnetospheric wind.     2. Advantages of the Galileo Plasma Measurements     The Galileo Mission advantages for plasma investigations in the Jovian magnetosphere are (1) the spinning section of the spacecraft, (2) an instrument microprocessor to restructure the instrument operation by ground command, and (3) a series of orbits that allow close flybys of the Galilean satellites, a survey of the Jovian magnetotail, and a substantial local-time survey of the magnetosphere. The spinning section of the spacecraft provides the important capability for a suitably designed instrument to view the entire 47 pi-steradian solid angle for particle velocity vectors at the spacecraft position.  The instrument microprocessor can be used to tailor the operation of the plasma instrument for the most effective measurements in each of the diverse plasma regimes of the magnetosphere and its environs, e.g., magnetosheath, plasma sheet, satellite wake or flux tube, or magnetospheric wind. Targeted encounters with the satellites and a tour of the magnetosphere and magnetotail offer exceptional opportunities for studies of most of the important plasma regions and their temporal responses to variations of Iogenic and solar wind plasmas, and the interactions of magnetospheric plasmas with the satellites.   The Galileo plasma instrumentation (PLS) is substantially more capable for measurements of the Jovian plasmas than those of the Pioneer and Voyager spacecraft because it is specifically designed for this purpose. The basic advantages are in the performance areas of (1) extended energy range, (2) coverage of the angular distributions of plasmas, (3) angular resolution, (4) temporal resolution, and (5) ion composition.   The energy-per-unit charge ranges of the Pioneer and Voyager plasma instruments are 100 to 4800 V and 10 to 5920 V, respectively. The corresponding range of the Galileo plasma analyzer is 0.9 to 52000 V. This extended energy range spans the important energy gap between 5920 and 30000 V in the combined performances for the Voyager plasma instrument and medium-energy particle detectors. The 47 pi-steradian solid angle for particle velocity vectors at the spacecraft position is sampled adequately to provide determinations of the three-dimensional velocity distributions for positive ions and electrons. Thus such important plasma parameters as field-aligned currents, cross-field currents, plasma bulk flow velocities, heat fluxes, and free energy are to be determined for the first time with the Galileo instrument. The angular resolution is sufficient to provide definitive measurements of the above plasma parameters. Temporal resolutions for obtaining electron and positive ion spectra are about 200s for the Pioneer analyzer (ions only) and about 100s for the Voyager Faraday cups. The corresponding temporal resolution for the Galileo plasma analyzer is about 0.5s; complete three-dimensional velocity distributions for positive ions and electrons can be telemetered once each 20s.  These improved temporal resolutions are particularly important during the brief encounters with the satellites and the traversals of plasma boundaries such as those of the plasma sheet and current sheet in the middle and outer magnetospheres.   Three miniature mass spectrometers which are positioned at the exit apertures of the electrostatic analyzers in the Galileo instrument provide determinations of the positive ion composition. The Voyager determinations of ion composition from E/Q spectra are model-dependent and are possible when the Mach number of the corotational flow is greater than 5 or 6. This method is acceptable generally near the Io orbit but as the Jovian radial distance increases, ion thermal speeds rapidly increase and prevent decisive identification of ion species. The Galileo mass spectrometers provide a direct determination of ion composition, specifically the mass-per-unit charge.   In addition to the above performance features, the Galileo plasma analyzer can be operated flexibly via electronic reconfiguration by ground command. The operational configuration of energy-per-unit charge (E/Q) passbands, mass-per-unit specific plasma region. The temporal resolution for a given measurement can also be selected. The Galileo plasma analyzer is equipped with sufficient onboard hardware and software to implement automated beam capture modes for ion velocity distributions and for determination of ion composition.     3. Several Anticipated Scientific Results     The capabilities of the Galileo plasma instrumentation are demonstrated here by application to several plasma regimes in the Jovian magnetosphere.   As the Galileo spacecraft crosses the plasma sheet in the middle and outer magnetospheres the magnitudes of field-aligned and cross-field currents are determined.  Their values and location are correlated with the position of the current sheet as found with the magnetometer. The motions of the plasma sheet are directly determined from the three-dimensional bulk flow vector and the azimuthal component is separated from the radial outflow or inflow. Angular distributions and ion compositions are examined in order to discern the contributions of electrons and ions from the ionosphere, the solar wind via the magnetosheath, and Io in the inner magnetosphere. Thus the formation and dynamics of the plasma sheet can be understood. The mechanism for the unusual heating of plasma with increasing radial distance is expected to be identified.   The encounters with the Galilean satellites offer exciting opportunities for observing plasma phenomena. Examination of the ion velocity distributions in the wakes of these satellites is used to determine the mechanism for ion loss from these bodies. The effectiveness of ion pickup by the magnetospheric plasma flow is derived from the signatures in the velocity distributions of these ions. The mass spectrometers are used to identify the major ions produced in the vicinity of the satellite. For Io these ions include O+, S+, and SO2+, and for icy satellites perhaps H+, C+, and H2O+ can be found. Such measurements give the rate of mass loss from each satellite. Perturbations of the plasma flow can be identified in terms of the conductivity of the satellite. During the closest satellite encounters it is possible that a magnetopause or ionopause is detected, thus providing further information concerning the magnetic and atmospheric properties of that body. If the flyby of the satellite is polar, detection of strong field-aligned currents to and away from the Jovian ionosphere might be expected. Field-aligned acceleration of ions and electrons by electrostatic double layers or anomalous resistivity is possible. The relative contributions of the various Galilean satellites for providing the ions in the plasma torus and sheet are assessed during the encounters.   The substantial periods of time that the Galileo spacecraft is located in the plasma sheet offer the unique opportunity to view the responses of the Jovian magnetosphere to the volcanic activity on Io. If specific Io volcanic eruptions can be identified with temporal fluctuations in densities, composition, and motions of the plasma sheet, remarkable advances in our knowledge of the transport of mass and momentum in the Jovian magnetosphere are envisioned.   Simultaneous observations of three-dimensional plasma velocity distributions and of plasma waves with the Galileo spacecraft allow the first studies of wave-particle interactions in the wide-ranging types of plasmas in the Jovian magnetosphere. A discussion of measurements of plasma waves during the Voyager encounters has been given by Gurnett and Scarf (1983). For example, the velocity distributions of ions can be examined to determine whether or not resonant acceleration by ion-cyclotron waves is an important mechanism for ion heating in the torus and plasma sheet. Further the amplitudes of broadband electrostatic noise can be compared with plasma velocity distributions to determine the importance of the anomalous resistivity in plasma heating. Free-energy sources, e.g., ring distributions in the electron velocity distributions, for the generation of electron cyclotron or upper hybrid waves may be identified and related to the wave amplitudes observed with the plasma wave instrument. In general the direct measurement of the plasma density and other parameters gives the growth, propagation and resonance conditions for plasma waves in wave-particle interactions. Thus the mechanisms for providing Jupiter with intense radio sources and particle precipitation into the auroral ionosphere can be further understood.   The existence of the magnetospheric wind at radial distances > 130 RJ in the dawn sector of the magnetosphere offers exciting goals for the orbit into the distant magnetotail. The origins of this wind are unknown. It is possible that the magnetospheric wind develops near the Alfven point, where the corotational speed is equal to the Alfven speed. The actual position must be determined from considerations of the tangential stress balance (cf. Vasyliunas, 1983). Thus magnetic bubbles could be slung radially outwards into the magnetotail. The low pressures in the magnetotail would produce super-Alfvenic radial outflow. On the other hand, the outflow wind might be thermally powered by the hot plasma in the plasma sheet inside the Alfven point. A third possibility is that the magnetospheric wind is the signature of reconnection of magnetotail lines in a convection pattern controlled by dayside magnetic merging rates.  The response of the magnetotail to fluctuating internal plasmas, e.g., Iogenic plasmas, or to a varying solar wind are unknown. In the magnetotail characterized by spectacular, explosive activity or a mere quiescent outflow of plasmas? The exploratory orbit into the magnetotail will indeed answer many questions concerning the origins and dynamics of this immense and little understood plasma region.     4. Overview of the Plasma Instrument     The instrument is divided into two analyzers, A and B. Each electrostatic analyzer comprises three 70 deg. spherical-segment plates. The outer and inner plates are grounded and the center plate is supplied with a programmed series of voltages to effect analyses of the energy spectra of electrons (E) and positive ions (P). The inner and outer channels between the plates are the positive ion and electron analyzers, respectively. A charged particle successfully passes through the channel on the basis of its energy-per-unit charge (E/Q). Continuous-channel electron multipliers, or Spiraltrons, are employed as sensors and are positioned at the exit apertures of the electrostatic analyzers. Charged particles arrive at positions at the exit aperture according to their direction of arrival at the entrance aperture. The analyzers are mounted on the instrument (magnetometer) boom of the spacecraft such that charged particles moving perpendicular to the spacecraft spin axis arrive at sensors 4E and 4P, and particles generally moving parallel and antiparallel to the spin axis are detected  with sensor pairs 7E, 7P and 1E, 1P, respectively.  Thus the fan-shaped fields-of-view are divided into segments by the use of multiple sensors. Rotation of the spacecraft spinning section allows coverage of almost the entire unit sphere and angular distributions are obtained by electronically sectoring the sensor responses as a function of spacecraft rotation angle. The angular sampling of electron velocity distributions is similar. The instrument is placed at a sufficient distance out along the boom to avoid obstruction of the fields-of-view by the large dish antenna of the spacecraft.   Three miniature mass spectrometers are included in the instrument for determining the composition, i.e., mass-per-unit charge (M/Q), of the positive ion plasmas. Two of these mass spectrometers are positioned at the exit aperture of electrostatic analyzer B, the third spectrometer is in analyzer A. Each of these mass spectrometers is equipped with two Spiraltrons as sensors and an electromagnet. One of these sensors is placed behind the electromagnet such that it accepts ions not deflected by the gap magnetic field. These 'integral flux' sensors are shown as 1MI, 2MI, and 3MI. The second sensor in each mass spectrometer is displaced from the undeflected path and accepts ions with M/Q values that are a function of the gap magnetic field. These 'differential flux' sensors are 1MD, 2MD, and 3MD. A programmed series of currents is fed to the electromagnet. If the polar angle is taken as 0 deg. in the direction of the spacecraft spin axis, then the fields-of-view are 11 deg. to 38 deg., 87 deg. to 93 deg., and 142 deg. to 169 deg. for spectrometers 1, 2, and 3, respectively.   The aperture cover serves two purposes. Prior to and during launch the cover in its closed position prevents contamination of the sensors from dust and condensable vapors. After the launch sequence, the cover is opened and is employed to tailor the fields-of-view of the sensors viewing at small angles to the spin axis of the spacecraft. The corresponding obstructions are identified as shapers.     5. Design of the Instrumentation     5.1. ELECTROSTATIC ANALYZER     The spherical-segment analyzer plates are precision-machined from solid blocks of magnesium. The radii of the inner and outer surfaces, respectively, of the four electrostatic analyzers are 9.68 and 9.95, 10.08 and 10.36, 11.77 and 12.10, and 12.23 and 12.57 cm. These plates are concentric. Thus the analyzer constant C ~ 18.2, where E/Q = CV and is the plate voltage. The angle from the center of the entrance aperture to the exit aperture of the analyzer is 70 deg. as referenced to the common center of curvature. Each of the concave surfaces within the analyzers has been machined with 140 saw-tooth serrations. The interior surfaces of the analyzer plates have been also electrodeposited with platinum black over gold electroplate. The two latter measures are taken in order to suppress the scattering of ultraviolet radiation and charged particles within the analyzers into the sensors. The entrance aperture is 60 deg. wide. Because the entrance aperture is wide in order to provide good angular coverage in spacecraft latitude, the fields-of-view shapers are used on the protective cover to limit excessive spreading in the azimuthal direction for the polar sensors. The center plate of each analyzer pair is supplied with voltages ranging from 0.05 to 2880 V in order to provide energy (E/Q) spectra of positive ion and electron intensities. The E/Q range is 0.9 eV q**-1 to 53 keV q**-1. There are 64 plate voltages that cover this energy range in logarithmically equal increments. The averaged full-width at half maximum responses (FWHM) of the ion and electron passbands are equal, DELTA E/E = 0.11. The range and sequence of plate voltages can be selected by ground command.   A total of seven sensors are used for the two electron analyzers, and seven for the two positive ion analyzers. These continuous channel multipliers are Spiraltrons, model SEM 4211 with 1-mm diameter apertures and model SEM 4213 with 3-mm diameter apertures, manufactured by Galileo Electro-Optics Corporation. Entrance apertures of these sensors are positioned at a distance 16 mm from the exit aperture of their respective electrostatic analyzers. The Spiraltrons with larger apertures are used for the two ion sensors that view closest to the spin axis of the spacecraft, i.e., the polar sensors, in order to offset the reduced projected area of the entrance aperture. The sensors are screened for stability by operation for ~2 x 10**9 accumulated counts at a gain > 10**8. Grounded mesh screens are mounted in front of the entrance apertures of the sensors to shield the sensor post-acceleration electric fields for the prevention of the collection of secondary charged particles produced in the interior of the instrument. The post-acceleration voltage for the ion sensors is approximately the bias voltage, and about +150 V for the electron sensors. The nominal gain of the Spiraltrons is 5 x 10**7 to 3 x 10**8 in the saturated pulse counting mode. The output charge is collected by small plates and the collection efficiency is improved by a potential difference of about 120 V for the electron sensors and 200 V for the ion sensors. This charge is received by hybrid amplifiers and discriminators manufactured by AMPTEK Inc., model A101. The threshold for these amplifiers was conservatively set at 4 x 10**6 electrons. The high voltage for sensor bias is programmable by ground command in 32 increments spanning the range 2200 to 3800 V in order to maximize the operating lifetime of the sensors against degradation by using the minimum charge per pulse. The pulse pair resolution of the amplifier/discriminator is nominally 250 ns (4 mHz), and about 1.4 micro-second (700 kHz) after modification for use in the instrument.     5.2. MINIATURE MASS SPECTROMETERS     Three miniature mass spectrometers are included in the plasma instrument, one spectrometer in analyzer A and two spectrometers in analyzer B. After passage through the electrostatic analyzer the positive ions enter two collimating slits. The dimensions of the first slit are 11.1 x 0.15 mm and for the second slit, 8.5 x 0.15 mm. These two slits are separated by 9.5 mm. The paths of the positive ions are then deflected according to their M/Q by the magnetic field in the gap of a small electromagnet. The gap dimension is 3.0 mm and the length and width of the pole pieces are 9.9 and 4.0 mm, respectively. The magnet core is fabricated from a material similar to HY MU 80 and wound with about 5000 turns of 332-gauge silver wire. Overlapped sheets of Permalloy 80 with thickness 0.010 inch are used to encase the plasma instrument to reduce the maximum stray field to 16 nanotesla (nT) at a distance of 1 m. The mass of the electromagnet is 150 g. The electromagnet is supplied with a programmed series of 64 currents ranging from 0.6 to 105 mA. The sequence of current values can be controlled by ground command. The corresponding range of gap magnetic fields is 0.0014 to 0.225 T. The ions are detected with two Spiraltrons, one Spiraltron (integral) with a 1-mm aperture for undeflected ions, and one Spiraltron (differential) with a 3-mm aperture that is offset from the path for undeflected ions. The magnet is non-focusing and the 3-mm aperture Spiraltron is used to achieve approximately equal geometric factors for the differential and integral channels. The sensor apertures are positioned at a distance 20.1 mm from the exit face of the electromagnet. A slit with width 0.76 mm is placed in front of each of the two Spiraltrons. The centers of these slits are separated by 3.30 mm. The Spiraltrons are operated in a similar manner as previously described for the sensors for the electrostatic analyzers.   At higher mass channels (larger current) H2+ and OH+ are deflected sufficiently to be detected with the differential sensor.  The M/Q value for the integral sensor is taken at a fraction 0.5 of the undeflected responses. For a given current step of the mass spectrometer, the averaged FWHM for the three mass spectrometers in terms of ion energy is DELTA E/E = 0.06. In general the differential channel is used for the detection of trace fluxes of light ions and the integral channel for abundant heavy ions in the Jovian magnetosphere. The mass resolutions of the mass spectrometers are M/DELTA M = 4.1 at full-width at 50% responses (FWHM) for the differential sensors (MD) and M/DELTA M ~ 2 for the integral sensors (MI). This resolution has been chosen to allow identification of the species H+, H2+ (He++), He+, O++, O+, Na+, S+, and K+ with the MD sensors and H+, H2+ (He++), O++, O+, S+, and SO2+ with the MI sensors. The E/Q ranges vary with the M/Q of the ion species, e.g., for the MD sensors, 0.9 V to 20 keV for H+, 0.9 V to 3 kV for O+, and 0.9 V to 800 V for S+. For the MI sensors, these ranges are 10 V to 52 kV for H+, 0.9 V to 52 kV for O+, and 0.9 V to 14 kV for S+. The mass spectrometers cannot distinguish between two ions with the same M/Q, e.g., O+ and S++. The mass spectrometers are designed in part with the criterion that corotating SO2+ (M/Q = 64 amu, E/Q ~ 2 kV) can be identified at Io's orbit.     5.3. GEOMETRIC FACTORS     A summary of the latitudinal coverage, energy resolutions, and geometric factors of each of the twenty sensors in the plasma instrument is given in Table I. The averaged geometric factors for the electron and positive ion sensors of the electrostatic analyzers and the positive ion sensors of the mass spectrometers are 3.4 x 10**-5, 6.4 x 10**-5, and 3.2 x 10**-6 cm**2 sr eV eV**-1 , respectively.   These values are computed by comprehensive ray tracing of trajectories through the electrostatic and magnetic analyzers and with the nominal entrance area of the sensor.  In practice both the efficiency and this area vary with individual sensors and final values of the geometric factors are derived from laboratory measurements and inflight responses in an isotropic plasma such as that in the plasma sheet during Earth1 encounter. These geometric factors are tailored to provide effective measurements of both the dense plasmas in the torus and the sparse plasmas of the outer Jovian magnetosphere.   The maximum responses of a single sensor to several representative plasmas are shown as functions of the plasma temperature, bulk flow speed V, and species. The bulk speed of 100 km s**-1 has been chosen as scale-wise representative for the corotational speeds in the torus. The densities of all the plasmas are each assumed to be 1 cm**-3. For example, if the density of S+ ions is 1000 cm**-3, V is 100 km s**-1, and the temperature kT is 100 eV, the maximum responses of the ion sensors of the electrostatic analyzer (P) and of the ion sensors of the mass spectrometers (M) are 4 x 10**6 and 2 x 10**5 counts s**-1, respectively, when viewing in the bulk flow direction. The geometric factor of the ion sensor (P) is sized such that these responses are somewhat above the saturation values for the sensor/amplifier, ~10**6 counts s**-1. The ion sensors in the mass spectrometers are employed to extend the dynamic range of these ion measurements to the larger ion densities by means of their lesser geometric factors. On the other hand, the large geometric factor of the ion sensors for the electrostatic analyzers provides the capability of the determining densities of hot (~ tens of keV), isotropic ions as low as 10**-3 to 10**-2 cm**-3 in the outer regions of the magnetosphere. Thus the combined geometric factors of the electrostatic analyzers and mass spectrometers accommodate a large range of ion densities. If the electron densities in the center of the plasma torus are 3000 cm**-3, then the maximum responses for the electron sensors are ~2 x 10**5 and 6 x 10**5 counts s**-1 for electron temperatures kT = 1 and 10 eV, respectively. For an electron temperature of 10 keV in the outer magnetosphere, densities as low as 10**-4 to 10**-3 cm**-3 can be well determined.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:go.ppr,PHOTOPOLARIMETER RADIOMETER for GO,PHOTOPOLARIMETER RADIOMETER,"   Instrument Overview =================== The Galileo Photopolarimeter Radiometer (PPR) is a multi-purpose and multi-function instrument designed for both solar wavelength photopolarimetry and thermal infrared sounding and radiation budget measurements.  Mounted on the Galileo Orbiter scan platform along with the SSI, NIMS, and UVS instruments, the PPR scene telescope has a single circular field of view of 2.5 mrad and uses scan platform slews and mosaic sequences to map out larger regions.  The wavelength observed is determined by the position of a rotating filter wheel with 32 equally spaced positions (numbered 0 through 31).  Positions 0 - 17 are used for three polarimetry wavelengths, 18 - 24 for seven thermal radiometry bands, and 25 - 31 for seven photometry bands. For the positions corresponding to polarimetry and photometry bands, the scene flux is directed by a relay lens through a Wollaston prism that splits the input into two orthogonally-polarized output beams, which are then focused onto a pair of silicon photodiode detectors. At each of the thermal radiometry positions, a chopper mirror alternately directs the scene flux and the space-view reference flux through the filter and then from an elliptical mirror on the back of the filter wheel to a pyroelectric detector.  The PPR is a 5-kg instrument with overall dimensions of 45 x 39 x 33 cm.   Scientific Objectives ===================== The primary science objectives and anticipated results of the PPR experiment are to:     (1) determine the vertical and horizontal distribution of cloud and       haze particles in the atmosphere of Jupiter, including their       size, shape, and refractive index;   (2) determine the energy budget of Jupiter and the variations in       amount and spatial distribution of reflected solar radiation       and emitted thermal radiation for Jupiter and its satellites,       including the thermal structure of the atmosphere and the       vertical distribution of absorbed solar radiation in the       atmosphere of Jupiter;   (3) measure and map the photometric, polarimetric, and radiometric       properties of the major satellites of Jupiter.   Instrument Calibration ====================== Various preflight and inflight tests of the PPR are performed to characterize the instrument performance and calibration.  Principal preflight tests included radiometric calibration of solar wavelength channels with standard lamps, polarization accuracy and instrumental polarization determination using various sources with known polarization, and radiometric calibration of thermal channels using blackbody calibration units with controllable temperatures in a thermal vacuum chamber environment.  Inflight radiometric calibration is performed with a radiometric calibration target (RCT-PPR) that is separately mounted on the spacecraft and viewed by the PPR at zero cone angle.  The RCT is passively cooled to a nominal temperature near 140 K, with the actual temperature monitored by two platinum resistance thermometers connected to the instrument so that their readouts can be included in the PPR science data stream.  A small tungsten-filament lamp is mounted in the RCT interior with an elliptically shaped, sapphire cover plate mounted such that its outer surface approximately conforms to the inner conical surface of the RCT.  When this lamp is commanded on, it serves as a radiometric and polarimetric reference standard for the shortwave channels.  There is a photometric calibration target on the spacecraft that can be viewed by all the remote sensing instruments, thus providing a visible and near-IR radiometric reference by solar illumination of its well- characterized diffusely reflecting surface.  Along with the other scan platform instruments, the PPR can use observations of relatively brighter stars as flux standards in the visible and near infrared. In addition, such observations are employed to characterize the off- axis light rejection of the PPR optical system and to determine the precise boresighting offsets between the scan platform instruments.   Operational Considerations ========================== The PPR is designed so that it may be commanded to operate in several different modes and with selectable configurations within each of those modes.  The selected mode and configuration parameters control the specific cycling of the filter wheel and thus the set of bands at which measurements are acquired during a single cycle.  With such flexibility in determining the operational mode, it is possible to select a measurement cycle that is optimized for various spacecraft scan platform slew rates as well as providing measurement sets other than the default of cycling through all the PPR bands when science objectives so dictate for particular targets or circumstances.   Basic instrument operational functions follow two very different processes depending on whether the measurements are photopolarimetry or thermal radiometry.  For polarimetry and photometry measurements, the flux from the scene is collected by the scene-view telescope and focused onto a circular field stop subtending 2.5 mrad.  Flux passed by the field stop then is modified by passage through optical elements located on the filter/retarder wheel.  At the polarimetry positions, the flux passes through a halfwave retarder and a spectral filter, while at photometry positions it passes only through a filter.  The relay lens directs the flux through the Wollaston prism which serves as a polarizing beam-splitter and produces two spatially-separated and orthogonally-polarized output beams.  The detector lenses focus these beams onto the two silicon photodiodes. During polarimetry and photometry measurements, the chopper is kept stationary and is positioned so as not to block the scene flux.  The amplified detector outputs are converted to a pair of 12-bit samples with dark-reading offsets of 190 DN.   During radiometry measurements, the chopper is operated at 30 Hz and alternately directs the flux from the scene-view and space-view telescopes through the field stop.  At each radiometry position, the flux passed by a radiometry filter is reflected radially outward from the filter/retarder wheel by means of an ellipsoidal mirror (one mounted on the wheel at each of the seven radiometry positions). The flux reflected by the ellipsoidal mirror is collected by a condenser system consisting of a truncated conical reflector with a small diamond lens mounted onto the small end of the cone.  The focused, modulated flux is detected by a lithium tantalate pyroelectric detector.  The alternate views from the scene-view and space-view telescopes allow the scene radiance to be referenced to the space background (approximately a 3 K blackbody).  There are four optical elements designated as 'radiometric stops' that serve to restrict the modulated flux reaching the detector to that received from the scene or space, or from the internal instrument elements, which are radiometrically balanced to first order.  These radiometric stops, together with careful preflight calibration, temperature monitoring of key optical elements, and an accurately-monitored, high emittance inflight calibration target (the RCT-PPR), are key to performing radiometrically useful measurements on a cool scene such as Jupiter with the warm PPR instrument.  The amplified detector output is converted to a 12-bit sample with a zero radiance level offset of 1400 DN.  In radiometry, the second sample of the pair is the 12-bit converted readout from one of ten thermistors monitoring the temperatures of internal optical elements or one of the two platinum resistance thermometers monitoring the RCT.  As radiometry measurements are acquired, the instrument cycles through the twelve temperature elements for the temperature data that are placed in the second sample of the pair, with the instrument housekeeping status identifying the specific element number.   It should be noted that for certain scan platform pointing directions (below about 90 degrees cone angle), spacecraft booms on the spinning part of the spacecraft sweep periodically through the fields of view of all remote sensing experiments.  The user of such data should be aware of these effects and remove them either by inspection from the artificial variation of data caused by boom obscuration or by use of a map of boom locations in spacecraft clock angle space.  The PPR can be commanded to use a 'boom operation mode' in which the filter wheel is fixed at a single position for an entire spacecraft spin period. With this type of operation, the booms affect the same ranges of sample numbers within the set of samples acquired during each spin period.   Detectors ========= Visible and Near-Infrared ------------------------- DETECTOR_ID                    = VISIBLE DETECTOR_TYPE                  = Si MINIMUM_WAVELENGTH             = 0.36 MAXIMUM_WAVELENGTH             = 0.97   The PPR uses two silicon photodiodes for the visible and near- infrared region (out to 0.97 micrometer).  For typical Jovian radiances, the signal to noise ratio for the polarimetry channels exceeds 2000 and for the photometry channels is greater than 1000 except for the 0.892 methane absorption band, which is approximately 400.  The Jovian albedo of Woodman et al. (1979, Icarus, v.37, 73) was used to set polarimetry and photometry gain levels.   Thermal Infrared ---------------- DETECTOR_ID                    = IR DETECTOR_TYPE                  = LiTaO3 MINIMUM_WAVELENGTH             = 0.3 MAXIMUM_WAVELENGTH             = 110   The PPR uses a lithium tantalate pyroelectric detector for the thermal infrared sounding bands and for the broad-band bolometric channels.  Sensitivity for the radiometry channels was affected by low long-wavelength responsivity of the detector and low filter transmission at several bands.  The signal to noise ratio for a 130 K target was measured to be 30 at 17 micrometers; 20 at 21 micrometers; 41 at 27.5 micrometers; 12 at 37 micrometers; 33 at >42 micrometers; and 460 for the solar plus thermal band with thermal input only.   Electronics =========== The low power electronics for the PPR instrument retains much of the radiation-proven circuitry from the predecessor instruments built for the Pioneer missions, but most of the discrete control logic has been replaced by a radiation-hard CMOS microprocessor system.  The analog circuitry consists of two silicon photodiode polarimetry and photometry channels, one pyroelectric radiometry channel, and an analog multiplexer, which presents the three signal channels and the temperature telemetry channels to the 12-bit analog to digital converter.  The digital circuitry decodes the serial spacecraft commands and formats the instrument signal and telemetry data for transfer to the spacecraft via the command and data bus.  The digital system also provides timing signals for analog channel and mechanism controls.  The power subsystem conditions the 30 vdc spacecraft input power and provides the necessary regulated and filtered voltages for instrument operation.  This subsystem also contains the power driver circuitry for the actuator controls and calibration lamp.   Optics ====== The PPR employs a 10-cm aperture scene-view telescope of Cassegrainian Dall-Kirkham design, which gives excellent image quality for the 2.5 mrad (0.143 degree) instantaneous field of view, with the image quality being dominated by diffraction at the longer wavelengths.  The alternating view of space for thermal radiometry observations is via reflection from the chopper mirror and the planar space-view telescope mirror.  Located on the filter/retarder wheel are spectral filters used to define the required spectral bandpasses, the halfwave retarders used for the polarization analysis of the scene, and the ellipsoidal mirrors (on the back side of the wheel) used to direct scene flux towards the radiometry detector.

Field of View ============= The PPR instrument has a circular field of view, with a diameter of 2.5 mrad, or 0.143 degrees.   Parameters ========== When the PPR is operating, it delivers an 18-byte science and housekeeping data record to the spacecraft command and data handling system every two-thirds of a second, i.e., once each minor frame of the spacecraft clock.  The first six bytes of this record are housekeeping data that completely specify the instrument status, both commanded parameters and position within operational measurement mode cycles.  The remaining twelve bytes are three sets of science data sample pairs and their associated identifying parameters and parity check bit.   Operational Modes ================= The commanded state of the PPR includes the selection of one of five basic operational modes: (1) cycle, (2) photopolarimetry plus photometry, (3) photometry, (4) radiometry, and (5) position select. In cycle mode, the PPR collects data at all of the photopolarimetry (polarimetry), radiometry, and photometry filter positions.  Filter wheel stepping is unidirectional from low to high filter position number.  In photopolarimetry plus photometry mode, the filter wheel stepping is unidirectional in the same manner as for cycle mode, but data is collected only at the polarimetry and photometry filter positions, with the instrument simply stepping through the radiometry positions.  In the photometry mode, the PPR collects data only at the photometry positions, using bidirectional stepping of the filter wheel.  Note that this involves stepping not only through the photometry positions, 25 - 31, but also positions 24 and 0 at which the dark current level restoration (DC-restore) function is performed.  In the radiometry mode, data is collected only at the radiometry positions (18 - 24), using bidirectional stepping of the filter wheel.  In the position select mode, the PPR collects data at a single filter or a contiguous series of filter positions, with the specific sequence determined by additional command parameters that specify the starting filter position and the number of additional positions (with choices of 0, 1, 2, and 5 additional positions).  If more than one filter position is specified, then the filter wheel steps through those positions in a bidirectional sequence.   Timing of the various PPR operations is based upon the same 30 Hz clock used for the chopper mirror, i.e., a clock cycle of 33.3 msec. The data sample integration period for polarimetry and photometry filter positions is 7 clock cycles and for radiometry positions is 14 clock cycles.  Stepping the filter wheel between adjacent positions requires 6 clock cycles.  In cycle mode, the start-up of the chopper at filter wheel position 18 to begin radiometry sampling and its stopping sequence at position 24 require 49 clock cycles.   Various command parameters control the specific nature of the sequence within each of the PPR modes.  In addition to the programmed filter position and the number of additional filter positions that control the range of positions at which data are collected in the position select mode, these parameters are as follows. GAIN STEP PP/PH:  Selects gain setting for photopolarimetry and photometry channels from among 16 levels, with each being separated from adjacent levels by a factor of approximately 1.4.   GAIN STEP RAD:  Selects gain setting for radiometry channel from among four levels, with each being a factor of 2 greater than the next lower level.   NUMBER OF SAMPLES:  Selects the number of samples of data to be accumulated at each active filter wheel position before stepping to the next filter, with the choices being 1, 4, 16, and 256 samples. In position select mode, the commanded number of samples is used as the number of cycles of position select operation occurring between DC-restore sequences (if the DC-restore parameter is commanded on).   NUMBER OF SAMPLES MULTIPLIER:  Selects the multiplier for number of samples at radiometry positions as either 1 or 4.  So if the number of samples were specified as 16 and the number of samples multiplier were 4, then 16 samples would be accumulated at each polarimetry and photometry position and 64 samples at each radiometry position.  The maximum number of samples is limited to 256.  A multiplexed function of this parameter is that when the external cal lamp is activated, the multiplier selects the lamp to be on for just six samples if it is set at 1 and keeps the lamp on for all the samples acquired during the spin period if it is set at 4.   CAL LAMP:  Enables or inhibits the preprogrammed calibrator lamp operation depending on whether the command bit is 1 or 0, respectively.  Enables the external cal lamp if it is set at 1 and if the boom sequence operation parameter is enabled as well.   DC-RESTORE:  Initiates special DC-restore cycle in position select mode or under boom sequence operation wherein the filter wheel is stepped to the appropriate DC-restore filter wheel position, the DC- restoration function is performed followed by readout of a single dark level sample, and the filter wheel is returned to the next position of the sequence of the selected mode.   BOOM SEQUENCE OPERATION:  Stepping of the filter wheel between adjacent functional positions is initiated once per spacecraft spin period based upon PPR receipt of spin period data and spin reference signal from the spacecraft.  The external cal lamp in the RCT is enabled only in boom sequence operation and if the cal lamp parameter is also set to enabled.   TEMPERATURE RANGE SELECT:  Selects the initial high or low range for thermistor temperature sensors.  If the thermistor output is out-of- range for the selected case, instrument software automatically switches the range for that particular thermistor readout.   Because of the differences in time required for specific steps of the instrument operation, the various operational modes of the PPR result in the generation of the 18-byte science data records at variable rates.  Those rates range from just slightly slower than that at which the spacecraft performs the readout of those records (viz., once each minor frame, or two-thirds of a second) to a rate that is approximately three times slower.  Accordingly, the PPR design uses two internal 18-byte buffers that are alternately filled, with one buffer being active, or in the state of being filled, and the other containing the previous 18 bytes of science data for the sequence. At the time of the each spacecraft readout of PPR data, it is only the non-active buffer that is presented and placed into the telemetry stream, and whenever that buffer has been previously transferred, the PPR sets a flag in the housekeeping data of that record to indicate that it is a 'repeat' record.  Thus, the PPR data stream in general contains redundant data in the form of these repeat records.  As a consequence, the spacecraft event times and scan platform pointing angles that are 'attached' to each minor frame in the spacecraft telemetry correspond to a variably later time than that at which the actual data samples in the PPR science data record for that minor frame were acquired.  The basic PPR data reduction software accounts for the specific operational modes and adjusts these times and scan platform pointing angles to provide accurate values for each of the three sample pairs within the 18-byte science records.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:go.pws,PLASMA WAVE RECEIVER for GO,PLASMA WAVE RECEIVER,"        The Galileo Plasma Wave Receiver is described by Gurnett et al.,      1992 [GURNETTETAL1992] which is provided in the DOCUMENT/PWS/INST directory of the PDS/PPI data archive volumes.   Scientific Objectives:   The basic objective of this investigation is the study of plasma waves and radio emissions in the magnetosphere of Jupiter.  The Voyager 1 and 2 flybys of Jupiter have now clearly shown that many complex types of plasma wave and radio-emission phenomena occur in the Jovian magnetosphere.  These include electromagnetic whistler mode emissions called chorus and hiss, electromagnetic continuum radiation trapped in the magnetospheric cavity, electrostatic waves associated with harmonics of the electron cyclotron frequency, and a wide variety of escaping radio emissions.  Some of these waves, such as the whistler mode emissions, are believed to play an important role in the dynamics of the magnetosphere by controlling the pitch-angle scattering and loss of energetic charged particles.  In other cases plasma waves provide an important diagnostic tool by revealing various characteristic frequencies of the plasma, from which quantities such as the electron density can be computed.   Since the Galileo spacecraft will be the first orbiter of Jupiter, this spacecraft will provide a much more comprehensive study of the Jovian magnetosphere than was possible with the previous Pioneer and Voyager flybys of Jupiter.  Specifically, the orbit of Galileo will provide a survey of the magnetotail at distances of up to 150 RJ over a range of local times near local midnight, a region that has never previously been explored; repeated passes through the plasma sheet, and the tail lobes; and numerous close flybys of the Galilean satellites. Of particular importance will be a very close pass by the satellite Io. The Voyager flybys showed that volcanic gases escaping from this moon are the main source of plasma in the Jovian magnetosphere.  The primary energization of plasma in the Jovian magnetosphere is believed to occur in a dense plasma torus that surrounds Jupiter near Io's orbit.  This energization is associated with many complex plasma wave phenomena, including the generation of intense kilometric and decametric radio emissions.   In addition to exploring regions never previously investigated, Galileo, by virtue of its long lifetime in orbit around Jupiter, also provides a unique new capability for carrying out studies of temporal variations on time scales that cannot be investigated with a single flyby.  For example, it is known that the kilometric and decametric radio emissions associated with Io and its plasma torus have temporal variations on time scales of weeks and longer. With Galileo these temporal variations can be monitored over periods of several years and compared with other remote sensing instruments. These measurements should be able to tell us, for example, whether the variations are associated with changes in the volcanoes on Io. Considerable interest also exists in searching for evidence of magnetospheric substorm phenomena, possibly comparable to auroral substorms in the Earth's magnetosphere.  With the Galileo plasma wave instrument, it should be possible to provide remote sensing of substorms in a manner comparable to the remote sensing of terrestrial auroral kilometric radiation, which is known to be closely associated with terrestrial substorms.   To carry out comprehensive studies of plasma waves and radio emissions at Jupiter, the Galileo plasma wave instrument incorporates several new features that provide improvements over the previous Voyager 1 and 2 measurements.  These improvements include (1) nearly simultaneous electric and magnetic field measurements to distinguish electrostatic waves from electromagnetic waves, (2) direction finding measurements to determine source locations, and (3) better frequency and time resolution to resolve fine structure in the plasma wave and radio emission spectrum.  The main instrument package and the electric dipole antenna system were designed and constructed at the University of Iowa, and the search coil magnetic antenna was provided by the Centre de Recherches en Physique de l'Environnement Terrestre et Planetaire (CRPE).     Calibration:     An extensive series of calibrations and performance checks were performed on the plasma wave instrument both on and off the spacecraft. Since the logarithmic compressors used in the spectrum analyzers do not give a true logarithmic response, the transfer function of the logarithmic compressors must be calibrated.  Because of the large number of channels, it is not practical to calibrate each frequency channel separately.  Instead, the transfer function is measured for each logarithmic compressor, and a frequency response calibration is performed at a fixed amplitude for all channels using that compressor. This procedure provides accurate calibrations for each frequency step because each band of the receiver uses a single filter and logarithmic compressor.   A look-up table can be constructed which converts the telemetry data number to input signal strength.  When combined with the overall frequency response across each band, these calibrations are sufficient to determine the signal strength in all channels served by this filter band and compressor.   In addition to the amplitude response of the compressors, a frequency response is also performed for each frequency channel. All frequency channels are checked to confirm that the filter bands have the proper shape and no spurious responses.  The effective noise bandwidths are measured by stimulating the instrument with a white noise signal of known spectral density.   For the electric field antenna, the electric field strength is computed by assuming that the antenna has an effective length of Leff = 3.5 meters. This length is the distance between the geometric centers of the two dipole elements.  For the search coil magnetic antennas, the magnetic field sensitivity and frequency response was calibrated in the IPG magnetic field observatory at Chambon La Foret, France.  These calibrations were performed using a Helmholtz coil driven by a known AC current source.  The absolute accuracy of the sensitivity calibration is estimated to be about 3 percent. The magnetic noise levels were measured by placing the search coils in a mu-metal chamber, which shields the sensors from external noise sources.   The calibration and other details of the GLL PWS are given in Kurth [KURTH1993].     Operational Considerations:     Nominally, the instrument is operated any time low rate science (LRS) or greater data rate capability is available.  When LRS is the maximum data rate, the instrument is operated in its power-up mode, with the SA and SFR toggling back and forth between the electric and magnetic antennas.  When wideband data can be recorded or transmitted to the Earth, then the wide range of instrument modes and antenna configurations are utilized based on the science objectives for a given time interval.  The UVS instrument has a stepper motor that drives its grating which is a major source of magnetic interference in the frequency range from about 100 Hz to 2 kHz.  Every attempt is made to work with the UVS team to minimize the times during which the grating is moved while PWS is observing on the magnetic antenna.  In many cases, this requires a time- sharing arrangement which allows for some percentage of magnetic viewing time in an interference-free environment, but which also allows UVS to observe with a moving grating in order to achieve its science objectives.   Detectors:     The plasma wave sensors on Galileo consist of one 6.6 meter tip-to-tip electric dipole antenna and two search coil magnetic antennas.  The electric dipole antenna is mounted at the end of the magnetometer boom approximately 10.6 meters from the spacecraft, and the search coil magnetic antennas are mounted on the high gain antenna feed.  The electric antenna consists of two graphite epoxy elements with a root diameter of 2.0 cm, tapering to 0.3 cm at the tip.  The dipole elements are mounted perpendicular to the magnetometer boom to minimize electric field distortion effects due to the spacecraft structure.  The antenna axis is also oriented perpendicular to the spacecraft spin axis in order to permit direction finding.  Each element is hinged 1.8 meters from the tip so that the antenna can be folded for launch.  A housing at the base of the dipole elements contains two preamplifiers.  These preamplifiers provide low impedance signals to the main electronics package. Each element is grounded to the spacecraft structure through a 250 MegOhm resistance to limit differential charging effects.   The search coil magnetic antenna consists of two high permeability rods, 25.5 and 27.5 cm long, one optimized for low frequencies, 5 Hz to 3.5 kHz, and the other optimized for high frequencies, 1 kHz to 50 kHz. The winding on the low frequency search coil consists of 50,000 turns of 0.07 mm diameter copper wire and the winding on the high frequency search coil consists of 2000 turns of 0.14 mm diameter copper wire. The two search coils are mounted orthogonally to minimize the electrical coupling between the sensors.  Both search coils are mounted perpendicular to the spacecraft spin axis.  The high frequency sensor is perpendicular to the electric dipole antenna and the low frequency sensor is parallel to the electric dipole antenna.  Two preamplifiers mounted in a housing near the search coil are used to provide low impedance signals to the main electronics package.  Frequencies below 2.4 kHz are obtained from the low frequency search coil, and frequencies above 2.4 kHz are obtained from the high frequency search coil.   Electronics:   All of the signal processing for the plasma wave experiment is performed in a single main electronics package.  The main electronics package is mounted in the spacecraft body near the base of the magnetometer boom. Signals from the electric dipole antenna and the two search coils are processed by a wideband receiver and three spectrum analyzers:  a high frequency spectrum analyzer also called the High Frequency Receiver (HFR), a medium frequency spectrum analyzer also called the Sweep Frequency Receiver (SFR), and a low frequency spectrum analyzer also called simply the Spectrum Analyzer (SA).  The HFR provides 42 frequencies from 100.8 kHz to 5.645 MHz with a fractional frequency spacing of delta-f/f ~ 10.0% and a bandwidth of 2 kHz.  One spectral sweep is provided every 18.67 seconds with a dynamic range of 100 db.  The SFR provides 112 frequencies from 40 Hz to 160 kHz with a fractional frequency spacing of delta-f/f ~ 8.0%.  This analyzer gives one spectral sweep every 18.67 seconds with a dynamic range of 100 db. The low frequency SA provides 4 logarithmically spaced frequency channels from 5.62 Hz to 31.1 Hz.  All four channels are sampled once every 2.67 seconds with a dynamic range of 110 db.  The data from the HFR, SFR, and SA (and survey wideband data as described below) are transmitted to the ground via the low rate telemetry at a bit rate of 240 bits/sec.   The wideband waveform receiver provides waveform measurements in three frequency bands, 5 Hz to 1 kHz, 50 Hz to 10 kHz, and 50 Hz to 80 kHz.  The frequency band to be used is controlled by the spacecraft Command and Data Subsystem (CDS).  An automatic gain control (AGC) circuit is used to control the amplitude of the output waveform. The AGC time constant is 0.1 seconds in the two high frequency bands and 1.0 second in the low frequency band.  The waveform from the wideband receiver is digitized by a 4-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC).  The sample rate of the ADC is fixed at either 3,150, 25,200, or 201,600 samples per second, depending on the frequency band selected. The waveform data can be transmitted in real time or recorded on the spacecraft digital tape recorder.   The plasma wave instrument has several modes of operation and methods of data transmission.  These modes are also controlled by the spacecraft CDS. The medium and low frequency spectrum analyzers and the wideband waveform receiver can be connected to either the electric dipole antenna or the search coil magnetic antennas.  In the normal mode of operation, the SFR and SA are cycled between the electric and magnetic antennas so that alternate electric and magnetic spectrums are obtained.  Since the search coils do not provide signals in the frequency range covered by the HFR, this analyzer is always connected to the electric antenna.  In the cycling mode of operation, the time required for a complete set of electric and magnetic field spectrums is 37.33 seconds.  The SFR and SA can also be locked on either the electric or magnetic antennas to provide improved time resolution at the expense of complementary electric and magnetic field coverage.  In all cases the HFR, SFR, and SA outputs consist of an 8-bit binary numbers that are approximately proportional to the logarithm of the received signal strength.  In the ground data processing the data from the HFR, SFR, and SA will be displayed in the form of color frequency-time spectrograms.  The frequency scale of the Galileo spectrograms will extend from 5.6 Hz to 5.65 MHz, and variable time scales will be available, ranging from 30 minutes to more than 24 hours, depending on the application.  Normally, 24-hour spectrograms will be used to survey the plasma wave data.  These survey spectrograms will be used to select specific intervals for more detailed analysis, such as comparison with charged particle or magnetic field data, or direction-finding analyses.   The greatest flexibility in the operation of the plasma wave instrument is available in the wideband waveform receiver.  This receiver provides very high resolution measurements of electric and magnetic field waveforms during times of special interest, such as the pass through the Io torus and satellite encounters.  The waveform data provide the highest possible frequency and time resolution, subject only to the constraints of Fourier analysis, delta-f*delta-t ~ 1. Although the waveform receiver has only three frequency bands, with bit rates of 12.6, 100.8, and 806.4 kbits/sec, several spacecraft modes are available for recording and transmitting the data to the ground.  In the highest time resolution mode, an essentially continuous sample of the electric or magnetic field waveform can be obtained over a bandwidth of 50 Hz to 80 kHz for periods of up to 18 minutes (the time required to fill the spacecraft tape recorder).   On the ground the waveform data will be Fourier transformed in discrete packets, usually consisting of 1024 samples, and displayed in the form of a frequency-time spectrogram.  These frequency-time spectrograms provide the highest time resolution data available from the Galileo plasma wave instrument.  In certain modes of operation, such as MPW, XPW, and PW4, the duration of the wideband recording can be extended at the expense of reduced duty cycle, frequency coverage, or analysis bandwidth.  To provide some wideband telemetry even when the high rate telemetry link is not available, a waveform survey output is included in the regular low rate telemetry data. This waveform survey output provides one block of 280 waveform samples every 18.67 seconds in two frequency bands, 5 Hz to 1 kHz and 50 Hz to 10 kHz.

The low frequency magnetic search coil is mounted with its effective axis parallel to the spacecraft X axis and the high frequency search coil is parallel to the spacecraft Y axis (perpendicular to the X axis and to the spacecraft spin axis.   Field of View:   The field of view of the PWS, whether from the electric dipole antenna or one of the magnetic search coils is a standard dipole antenna pattern which has a maximum sensitivity to the field along the axis of the sensor.  For radio waves which propagate above the characteristic frequencies of the plasma and which do not interact with the local plasma, this means maximum sensitivity is to sources in a plane perpendicular to the antenna axis, since the electric and magnetic fields of a radio wave are normally perpendicular to the propagation vector.   Data Rates:   The basic low rate science (LRS) data rate of the instrument is 240 bps. Wideband waveform receiver data rates range from 19.2 kbps to 806.4 kbps, depending on the telemetry mode.  Rates of 94._ kbps and lower can be either recorded on the spacecraft tape recorder or transmitted directly to the ground; rates of 403.2 and 806.4 kbps can only be recorded onboard for later playback at lower rates.   Instrument Modes:   The PWS has several modes of operation.  The SA and SFR can either monitor only the electric antenna, only the magnetic antenna, or toggle back and forth between the two, obtaining a complete spectral scan from each antenna before switching to the other.  This toggling mode is the most commonly utilized mode.  There is also a mode which enables the magnetic search coil calibration tone.  When enabled, the calibration signal is excited for 56 mf (37.33 sec) at the beginning of each MOD(RIM,8)=0 until disabled.   The wideband receiver has three basic modes (analysis bandwidths) and can be attached to either the electric antenna or the magnetic. The three modes provide analysis bandwidths of 10 kHz, 80 kHz, and 1 kHz although there is an additional mode which toggles between the 10 kHz and 1 kHz mode.  In this mode, the waveform data is collected for 14 mf (9.33 sec) in one bandwidth and then for 14 mf in the other bandwidth.   A wide range of telemetry formats are available for the wideband data. For any one of the three wideband modes, the instantaneous data rate is fixed (806.4 kbps for the 80 kHz mode, 100.8 kbps for the 10 kHz mode, and 12.6 kbps for the 1 kHz mode.  However, the different telemetry modes differ primarily in the number of consecutive samples collected during an RTI.  This results in a variation in the duty cycle depending on the data rate allocated to this data stream in the selected telemetry mode.   Phase 2 Software Implications:   In response to the failure of the high gain antenna and the resulting reduction in downlink telecommunications capabilities for the Galileo spacecraft, the Galileo Project undertook a massive re-programming of onboard software in order to enable science observations in Jupiter orbit.  Coupled with flight software changes, modifications to the Deep Space Network were also undertaken to improve the overall downlink capability from the spacecraft.  Together, these actions increased the actual bit-to-ground capability from a maximum of about 10 bps to a maximum of 160 bps.  In addition, onboard data compression was implemented which increased the information content of the downlink by roughly a factor of 10.   The PWS instrument has no microprocessor; all of its functions are hardwired, hence, no reprogramming of the instrument itself was possible.  One result of this is that the basic timing of the instrument is identical to that described in the section above. However, significant software additions in the CDS and AACS were implemented which enable the PWS to perform its basic observations at dramatically lower data rates.  These changes can be categorized simply as editing and compression. The LRS observations are edited as described below to reduce the observations retained for downlink from 240 bps to 65 bps.  The remaining 65 bps LRS data stream is then compressed using the same integer cosine transform (ICT) algorithm as used for the Solid State Imaging (SSI) data.  The severity of this compression is variable and can range from 40 bps to 5 bps, with 5 bps being the most often utilized data rate. The wideband data are not compressed and are minimized through editing functions only.  In addition, a new wideband telemetry mode was developed which uses bit allocations in the original LRS telemetry frame originally reserved for Golay encoding to produce a mode with drastically reduced data rate requirements.   Realtime Science   LRS Editing and Compression:  The original PWS LRS data stream is edited to reduce the data rate before compression from 240 bps to 65 bps.  First, the 120 bits of waveform survey data are edited out of the data stream.  Second, all housekeeping and status information is removed; if one assumes that the sequenced commands are executed properly and the instrument timing is maintained, the status of the instrument can be unambiguously determined from the most recent mode command and the current spacecraft clock.  A recorded mode like the original LRS but now called LPW preserves the full, original PWS LRS data stream and can be used to compare realtime science with the full data steam at limited times in case questions arise about the assumptions of correct command execution or instrument timing.  Third, only one sample per channel is preserved in a given 18.67-second instrument cycle.  Accordingly, only the first sample of the four SA channels are retained and only the first sample of the lower frequency HFR channels are retained.  Further, since there is an overlap between the upper frequency range of Band 4 of the MFR with the lower range of the HFR, and since the HFR has better sensitivity over this range, the highest frequency 6 channels of MFR band 4 are edited out.  What remains is a single sample of each of 152 of the original 158 channels in the low rate portion of the instrument.  This is the data stream which is forwarded to the AACS for ICT compression.   The ICT compression works on 8x8 pixel blocks of an image. Since The PWS dynamic spectrogram can be thought of as an image, the compression algorithm can be used to compress the spectrogram prior to transmission to the ground.  One complication is that the PWS generally alternates between a magnetic and electric spectrum (at least for the SA and MFR channels) and the resulting alternating spectra add entropy to the 'image' and thereby reduce the compressibility of the data set.  Therefore, the electric and magnetic spectra are separated or 'unzipped' prior to compression.  Also, it is necessary to build up 8x8 blocks of the spectrogram.  152 channels can be broken into 19 8-channel segments, hence, 8 electric and 8 magnetic spectra are accumulated in order to make an 8x152 pixel strip (19 8x8 blocks) of electric field data and a similar strip for the magnetic data.  (Note that the electric HFR data is included with the magnetic strip so that the 18.67-sec samples of the HFR channels are preserved.)  Hence, data is collected on 16 x 18.67 second time intervals (about 5 minutes) in order to build the two 8x152 pixel strips.  Each of the strips is compressed individually with all 19 8x8 blocks in each being used to generate a downlink packet.  Since transmission errors will make decompression impossible for all data following the error, a 5-minute gap will appear for any packet with a telemetry error. Fortunately, telemetry errors are very infrequent and the data which reaches the ground intact is virtually immune from the spikes typical of bursty bit errors in an uncompressed telemetry stream.   Once on the ground, the electric and magnetic strips are decompressed and 'zipped' back together in the original time order. This allows sequential electric (or magnetic) spectra to be maintained together in the event the instrument is not cycled between E and B sweeps. The net result of this compression/decompression scheme is that the full temporal and spectral resolution of the PWS instrument is maintained even though the real data rate to the ground is as low as 5 bps.  Of course, as in any lossy compression scheme, information is lost.  By maintaining the spectral and temporal resolution, the loss in the resulting data set is in amplitude inaccuracy.  Based on both ground experimentation and analysis of the Jupiter data, we believe the amplitude errors at 5 bps are no more than about 6 dB and are much less at the higher data rates (less severe compression).  At 5 bps these amplitude errors appear as 'tiling' in which all pixels in a given 8x8 block have similar values but are different from adjoining 8x8 blocks or else the 8x8 blocks take on a checkerboard appearance.  The errors do not appear to be systematic, hence, we believe that averaging pixels in frequency and time over regions of the spectrogram where the spectrum appears to be 'simple' could provide a better estimate of the true signal strength.  Generally, however, the 5 dB accuracy will enable a wide range of studies without need to know the absolute amplitude better than a few dB.   Recorded Data   LRS data:  When PWS data are recorded, the full LRS data stream is recorded and played back.  This includes all status bits, additional samples of multiply-sampled channels (e.g. SA channels), and the waveform survey data.  The discussion of data in the original instrument description is fully applicable in this case.   Wideband data:  The wideband data suffered the most through the process of reducing the downlink requirements.  Nevertheless, a minimal wideband capability was retained.  Beginning with the Io flyby, a new data mode was introduced which replace the Golay encoding bits formerly used for the LRS data format with PWS wideband data in the LPW format. This mode is called LPW and is usually modified with the term Golay bits to distinguish these data from the low rate data.  All three of the bandwidths (wideband modes) can be used with the LPW format and for each, a total of 832(????) contiguous 4-bit samples are acquired. However, these 832 samples are recorded only once per 2 minor frames, or 2.67 seconds, hence, the best spectral temporal resolution (temporal resolution of Fourier transforms assuming 1 transform per set of contiguous samples) is 2.67 seconds.  The spectral resolution (416 spectral components is very competitive with the HPW (94._ kbps mode) but the temporal resolution is poorer by a factor of about 50.  It is this mode, however, which is used for virtually all of the orbital tour recording.   Some of the original wideband telemetry modes were eliminated and those which remain (in addition to the LPW/Golay bits) are MPW, MPP, and HPW.  These provide 7.68, 19.2, and 94._ kbps, respectively. In practice, the LPW/Golay bits provides superior spectral resolution over the MPW mode at significantly reduced bit rate (due to the poor temporal resolution) and the MPW mode is not utilized in the tour.  Limited use of the MPP and HPW modes is included in the tour data set, however.   For all the wideband telemetry modes, an additional capability for reducing the downlink requirements was implemented.  This is an editing function often referred to as '1 of n-line editing' and consists of returning 1 of every n sets of contiguous samples recorded. Most of the tour data were returned with n = 2 or n = 4 so that the temporal resolution of the Fourier transformed spectra are a factor of 2 or 4 poorer than the original recorded data.  For example, in the LPW/Golay bits mode, if n = 2, the time between returned spectra is not 2.67 seconds, but 5.33 seconds.  Reducing the number of samples in a contiguous set of samples by returning every nth sample was never considered because this would under sample the waveform and lead to aliasing problems.  Likewise, truncating the number of samples in a set would reduce the spectral resolution, thereby defeating the remaining attribute of the wideband data.

Much of this was shared equipment, being used for routine       telecommunications as well as for Radio Science.  The       performance and calibration of both the spacecraft and tracking       stations directly affected the radio science data accuracy, and       they played a major role in determining the quality of the       results.  The spacecraft part of the radio science instrument       is described immediately below; that is followed by a       description of the DSN (ground) part of the instrument.         Radio Science investigations were carried out by two teams.       The Celestial Mechanics Team, under Team Leader John Anderson,       conducted experimental tests of general relativity (including       searching for gravitational waves), made measurements to       improve solar system ephemerides, and sought to improve       gravitational models for Jupiter and its satellites       [ANDERSONETAL1992].  The Radio Propagation Team, under Team       Leader Tay Howard, investigated the solar corona and carried       out various studies in the Jovian system primarily concerning       atmospheres and ionospheres [HOWARDETAL1992].         Instrument Specifications - Spacecraft     ======================================       The Galileo spacecraft telecommunications subsystem served       as part of a radio science subsystem for investigations       primarily of Jupiter and its satellites, but also including       Venus, the Earth-Moon system, and the Sun.  Many details of       the subsystem are unknown; its 'build date' is taken to be       1989-01-01, which was during the prelaunch phase of the       Galileo mission.

The exact frequency transmitted from the spacecraft was       controlled by the signal received from a ground station       ('two-way' or 'coherent' mode) or by an on-board oscillator       ('one-way' or 'non-coherent' mode).  In some circumstances       an uplink signal was transmitted from one ground station       while two ground stations participated in reception; this was       known as the 'three-way' mode.  In the absence of an uplink       signal, the spacecraft system switched automatically to the       one-way mode.  The on-board frequency reference could be       either of two redundant 'auxiliary' crystal oscillators or       a single ultra-stable oscillator (USO) provided specifically       to support radio science observations.         Each transponder included a receiver, command detector,       exciter, and low-power amplifier.  The transponders provided       the usual uplink command and downlink data transmission       capabilities.  The following modulation states could be       commanded: telemetry alone, ranging alone, telemetry and       ranging, or carrier only.         Each transponder could be operated through one of two       low-gain antennas at S-band only; a furlable high-gain       antenna (HGA) never deployed properly during Cruise,       resulting in a serious degradation of radio science       measurements, including loss of X-band capability.  The HGA       was aligned with the spin axis of the rotor part of the       spacecraft.  Low-Gain Antenna 1 (LGA-1) was located at the       end of the HGA feed, so it is also aligned with the spin axis.       LGA-2 was at the end of a boom, 3.52 m from the spin axis.         When operating in the coherent mode, the transponder downlink       frequency was related to the uplink frequency by the       'turn-around ratio' of 240/221 at S-band.  At X-band it would       have been 880/749.  An X-band downlink controlled by an S-band       uplink would have had a turn-around ratio of (240/221)*(11/3).         Science Objectives     ==================       Two different types of radio science measurements were       conducted with the Galileo Orbiter: radio tracking in which       the magnitude and direction of gravitational forces could be       derived from 'closed-loop' Doppler (and, sometimes, ranging)       measurements, and radio propagation experiments in which       modulation on the signal received at Earth stations       could be attributed to properties of the intervening medium.       The radio science measurements were analyzed by two       investigation teams; the Celestial Mechanics Team was       primarily interested in characterizing variations in       gravitational forces, and the Radio Propagation Team was       primarily interested in the atmospheres of the Sun, Jupiter,       and Jupiter's satellites.         Gravity Measurements       --------------------         Measurement of the gravity field provides significant         constraints on inferences about interior structure of         Jupiter and its satellites.  Precise, detailed study of         spacecraft motion in Jupiter orbit and during satellite         flybys can yield a mass distribution of each body and         higher-order field terms if the measurements are sensitive         enough.  Compared with determinations from previous missions,         improvements in the gravity field of Jupiter itself were not         expected from tracking the Galileo Orbiter, but second-order         gravity harmonics were expected from flyby encounters with         satellites.  One equatorial and one polar flyby at Ganymede         were sought to determine independently the rotational and         tidal response of the body assuming hydrostatic equilibrium.         Departures from hydrostatic equilibrium were expected  to         confuse that issue at Europa, though the measurements were         expected to be useful, while the relatively weak response         to rotation and tides at Callisto made the experiment most         marginal there [HUBBARD&ANDERSON1978].  Differences in         principal moments of inertia to an accuracy of one percent         or better were sought at Io [ANDERSONETAL1996].         Tests of General Relativity       ---------------------------         There has been continuing interest in testing the theory         of general relativity by bouncing radar signals from hard         planetary surfaces and using two-way ranging data from         spacecraft anchored to other planetary bodies.  No hard         surface exists at Jupiter and no previous spacecraft had         orbited the planet, so Galileo represented a unique         opportunity to investigate this question.  Two years of         ranging to Galileo were expected to fix the range to Jupiter         to an accuracy of about 150 m, with the limit set by orbit         determination error along the Earth-Jupiter line and not by         limitations of the radio 'instrument'.  In combination with         results from the Pioneer and Voyager spacecraft, these         measurements were expected to lead to an improved ephemeris         for Jupiter.           As Jupiter (and Galileo) appear to pass behind the Sun when         viewed from Earth, solar gravity should retard the radio         signal propagating between the spacecraft and Earth.  One         set of time delay measurements to/from the Viking Orbiters         and Landers agreed to within 0.1 percent of the General         Relativity prediction.  Measurements with Galileo were         expected to be a factor of 5 worse, but the next best         measurements were only to 2 percent of the General Relativity         prediction.  Not only would another set of measurements at         the sub-one percent level be good experimental practice,         but Galileo measurements could also verify the agreement         over a range of directions in inertial space [WILL1981].           The red shift of the signal in Jupiter's gravitational field         could be measured to an accuracy of about +/-1 percent after         radiation hardening of the USO crystal in Jupiter's charged         particle environment.         Search for Gravitational Radiation       ----------------------------------         Matter undergoing asymmetrical motion (theoretically) radiates         gravitational waves which propagate at the velocity of light.         Observed acceleration of the mean orbital motion of binary         pulsar PSR 1913+16 is consistent with predictions         [TAYLOR&WEISBERG1989]; other evidence is more ambiguous, and         gravity waves themselves had not been detected with certainty         before Galileo.  For several extended periods during Galileo's         cruise to Jupiter, when other spacecraft activity was at a         minimum and when the spacecraft was near opposition, its radio         link with Earth was monitored carefully for signs of passing,         cosmicly generated, long period gravitational waves.  Similar         observations were conducted simultaneously with the Mars         Observer and Ulysses spacecraft so that detections could be         confirmed and direction of propagation of the gravitational         waves inferred from time differences along other paths.         Previous searches have been conducted using Viking, Voyager,         and Pioneers 10 and 11 [ARMSTRONG1989].         Solar Corona Observations       -------------------------         For several weeks around each of four superior conjunctions         Galileo's radio link passed through the solar corona.         Signals were scattered and refracted as they propagated         through the turbulent plasma; the resulting modulation could         be analyzed to obtain estimates of coronal structure and         dynamics [WOO1993].  Specific objectives of the Galileo solar         corona experiments included better understanding of:           (1) three-dimensional electron density distribution and its               relation to the photospheric magnetic field               configuration, solar cycle, distance from the surface,               and solar latitude;           (2) structural differences among coronal 'holes', active               regions, and the 'quiet' Sun;           (3) characteristics of the acceleration regions of the solar               wind in coronal holes, streamers, and other parts of the               corona;           (4) energy sources responsible for creation of coronal               materials with temperatures over 1000000K;           (5) resonant solar oscillations on the dynamical               characteristics of the tenuous solar atmosphere;           (6) excitation and propagation conditions for               magnetoacoustic, Alfven, and other waves; and           (7) form and evolution of disturbances near the Sun and               their relationship to white light coronal mass               ejections.         Jupiter Occultations       --------------------         Radio occultation measurements can contribute to an improved         understanding of structure, circulation, dynamics, and         transport in the atmosphere of Jupiter.  Results from Galileo         were based on detailed analysis of the radio signal as it         entered and exited occultation by the planet.  Three phases         of the atmospheric investigation may be defined.  The first         is to obtain vertical profiles of electron content in the         ionosphere; second is to extract large scale structure in         the neutral atmosphere; third is to detect and interpret fine         scale structure in both the ionospheric and neutral         atmosphere profiles and to measure absorption in the neutral         atmosphere.           The Galileo tour permitted radio occultations on approximately         half of the planned orbits at a number of latitudes.  Pioneers         10 and 11 had earlier shown sharp, multiple, dense, low-lying         ionospheric layers [FJELDBOETAL1976].  The vertical extent of         the ionized layers, their time histories, and detailed         structure were sought as keys to both the composition and         chemistry of the upper atmosphere.           With precise pointing of the HGA, Galileo was expected to         penetrate below the condensation level for ammonia in the         neutral atmosphere, providing global measures of ammonia         concentration in well-mixed regions where Voyager had produced         only one [LINDALETAL1981].  Measurements between 15N and 15S         latitudes were expected to provide snapshots of vertical         structure of waves propagating in the atmosphere; ingress and         egress measurements from the same occultation could provide         strong constraints on zonal wavenumber and meridional         structure [HINSON&MAGALHAES1991].         Satellite Occultations       ----------------------         Radio data acquired during occultation by a satellite could         be used to determine its diameter to accuracies on the order         of 1 km and, possibly, properties of any satellite atmosphere         or ionosphere.  In the case of Io a substantial ionosphere         had been detected by Pioneer 10 [KLIOREETAL1975]; repeated         occultations by Io were intended to improve understanding         of spatial and temporal variability of the charged particles         and their interaction with Jupiter's magnetic field.         Occultations by the Io torus would provide a measure of the         total number of free electrons along the propagation path,         a useful constraint of the spatial structure of the torus.         Jupiter's Magnetic Field       ------------------------         Galileo was the first spacecraft equipped to measure both         Faraday rotation of propagating waves and differential phase         retardation between S- and X-band.  Faraday rotation         measurements were planned during each occultation by Jupiter         and were to be used to investigate the characteristics of         the magnetic field in the planet's ionosphere.  Different         models of the magnetic field yield differences in the         predicted Faraday rotation on the order of 0.3 radians; the         Faraday rotation experiment designed for Galileo         exceeded this threshold by a factor of 10.         Bistatic Scattering from Icy Galilean Moons       -------------------------------------------         Monostatic radar echoes from Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto         were found to be anomalously diffuse, strong, and polarized         [CAMPBELLETAL1978].  By using the Galileo spacecraft as a         microwave signal source during encounters with each of these         bodies, the bistatic scattering as a function of angle could         be determined, providing constraints on both the models for         the anomalous scattering process and also the properties of         the ice that presumably is responsible.         Operational Considerations - Spacecraft     =======================================         Because the HGA never deployed and only right-circularly       polarized signals at S-band were available from LGA-1, the       Faraday and dual-frequency measurements were never realized.       For the Celestial Mechanics Team, the single frequency meant       that signal dispersion resulting from passage through the       solar wind, Earth's ionosphere, and other media could not       be removed easily from data.  For the Radio Propagation Team,       the loss of antenna gain meant that only observations with       the strongest signals could be made.  Penetration below the       ionosphere during Jupiter occultations and sensing charged       and neutral particle environments of satellites became very       difficult, and the bistatic surface experiments were dropped.       Because Faraday Rotation experiments required linearly       transmitted polarizations (available only from the HGA),       those were also dropped.       Calibration Description - Spacecraft     ====================================       No information available.         Platform Mounting Descriptions - Spacecraft     ===========================================       The HGA and LGA-1 antennas were mounted facing in the negative       Zr direction; see the GO_SPACECRAFT_DESC_INST.CAT file for       more information.

Porsche              DFLR, Germany       Experiment Representative at JPL for both teams was Randy       Herrera.         Instrument Section / Operating Mode Descriptions - Spacecraft     =============================================================       The Galileo radio system consisted of two sections, which       could be operated in the following modes:         Section      Mode       -------------------------------------------       Oscillator   two-way (coherent)                    one-way (non-coherent)       RF output    low-gain antenna (choice from two)                    high-gain antenna (failed to deploy properly)         Details for the radio system, as designed, are given in the       table below:          Transmitting Parameters:         Frequency (MHz)                    8415       2295         Transmit Power (w)               12 or 21    9 or 27         HGA Gain (dBi)                      50         38         HGA Half-Power Beamwidth (deg)      0.6        1.5         Polarization                    LCP or RCP   Linear         Axial Ratio (dB)                     2         32          Receiving Parameters:         Frequency (MHz)                    7167       2115         HGA Gain (dBi)                      46         36         Polarization                    LCP or RCP   Linear         Noise Temperature (K)               270       1000         Instrument Overview - DSN     =========================       Three Deep Space Communications Complexes (DSCCs) (near       Barstow, CA; Canberra, Australia; and Madrid, Spain) comprise       the DSN tracking network.  Each complex is equipped with       several antennas [including at least one each 70-m, 34-m High       Efficiency (HEF), and 34-m standard (STD)], associated       electronics, and operational systems.  Primary activity at each       complex is radiation of commands to and reception of telemetry       data from active spacecraft.  Transmission and reception is       possible in several radio-frequency bands, the most common       being S-band (nominally a frequency of 2100-2300 MHz or a       wavelength of 14.2-13.0 cm) and X-band (7100-8500 MHz or 4.2-       3.5 cm).  Transmitter output powers of up to 400 kw are       available.         Ground stations have the ability to transmit coded and uncoded       waveforms which can be echoed by distant spacecraft.  Analysis       of the received coding allows navigators to determine the       distance to the spacecraft; analysis of Doppler shift on the       carrier signal allows estimation of the line-of-sight       spacecraft velocity.  Range and Doppler measurements are used       to calculate the spacecraft trajectory and to infer gravity       fields of objects near the spacecraft.         Ground stations can record spacecraft signals that have       propagated through or been scattered from target media.       Measurements of signal parameters after wave interactions with       surfaces, atmospheres, rings, and plasmas are used to infer       physical and electrical properties of the target.         Principal investigators vary from experiment to experiment.       See the corresponding section of the spacecraft instrument       description or the data set description for specifics.         The Deep Space Network is managed by the Jet Propulsion       Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology for the       U.S.  National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

Subsystems - DSN     ================       The Deep Space Communications Complexes (DSCCs) are an integral       part of the Radio Science instrument, along with other       receiving stations and the spacecraft Radio Frequency       Subsystem.  Their system performance directly determines the       degree of success of Radio Science investigations, and their       system calibration determines the degree of accuracy in the       results of the experiments.  The following paragraphs describe       the functions performed by the individual subsystems of a DSCC.

The DMC is the center of activity at a DSCC.  The         DMC receives and archives most of the information from the         NOCC needed by the various DSCC subsystems during their         operation.  Control of most of the DSCC subsystems, as well         as the handling and displaying of any responses to control         directives and configuration and status information received         from each of the subsystems, is done through the DMC.  The         effect of this is to centralize the control, display, and         archiving functions necessary to operate a DSCC.         Communication between the various subsystems is done using a         Local Area Network (LAN) hooked up to each subsystem via a         network interface unit (NIU).           DMC operations are divided into two separate areas: the         Complex Monitor and Control (CMC) and the Link Monitor and         Control (LMC).  The primary purpose of the CMC processor for         Radio Science support is to receive and store all predict         sets transmitted from NOCC such as Radio Science, antenna         pointing, tracking, receiver, and uplink predict sets and         then, at a later time, to distribute them to the appropriate         subsystems via the LAN.  Those predict sets can be stored in         the CMC for a maximum of three days under normal conditions.         The CMC also receives, processes, and displays event/alarm         messages; maintains an operator log; and produces tape labels         for the DSP.  Assignment and configuration of the LMCs is         done through the CMC; to a limited degree the CMC can perform         some of the functions performed by the LMC.  There are two         CMCs (one on-line and one backup) and three LMCs at each DSCC         The backup CMC can function as an additional LMC if         necessary.           The LMC processor provides the operator interface for monitor         and control of a link -- a group of equipment required to         support a spacecraft pass.  For Radio Science, a link might         include the DSCC Spectrum Processing Subsystem (DSP) (which,         in turn, can control the SSI), or the Tracking Subsystem.         The LMC also maintains an operator log which includes         operator directives and subsystem responses.  One important         Radio Science specific function that the LMC performs is         receipt and transmission of the system temperature and signal         level data from the PPM for display at the LMC console and         for inclusion in Monitor blocks.  These blocks are recorded         on magnetic tape as well as appearing in the Mission Control         and Computing Center (MCCC) displays.  The LMC is required to         operate without interruption for the duration of the Radio         Science data acquisition period.           The Area Routing Assembly (ARA), which is part of the Digital         Communications Subsystem, controls all data communication         between the stations and JPL.  The ARA receives all required         data and status messages from the LMC/CMC and can record them         to tape as well as transmit them to JPL via data lines.  The         ARA also receives predicts and other data from JPL and passes         them on to the CMC.           DSCC Antenna Mechanical Subsystem       ---------------------------------         Multi-mission Radio Science activities require support from         the 70-m, 34-m HEF, and 34-m STD antenna subnets.  The         antennas at each DSCC function as large-aperture collectors         which, by double reflection, cause the incoming radio         frequency (RF) energy to enter the feed horns.  The large         collecting surface of the antenna focuses the incoming energy         onto a subreflector, which is adjustable in both axial and         angular position.  These adjustments are made to correct for         gravitational deformation of the antenna as it moves between         zenith and the horizon; the deformation can be as large as         5 cm.  The subreflector adjustments optimize the channeling         of energy from the primary reflector to the subreflector         and then to the feed horns.  The 70-m and 34-m HEF antennas         have 'shaped' primary and secondary reflectors, with forms         that are modified paraboloids.  This customization allows         more uniform illumination of one reflector by another.  The         34-m STD primary reflectors are classical paraboloids, while         the subreflectors are standard hyperboloids.           On the 70-m and 34-m STD antennas, the subreflector directs         received energy from the antenna onto a dichroic plate, a         device which reflects S-band energy to the S-band feed horn         and passes X-band energy through to the X-band feed horn.  In         the 34-m HEF, there is one 'common aperture feed,' which         accepts both frequencies without requiring a dichroic plate.         RF energy to be transmitted into space by the horns is         focused by the reflectors into narrow cylindrical beams,         pointed with high precision (either to the dichroic plate or         directly to the subreflector) by a series of drive motors and         gear trains that can rotate the movable components and their         support structures.           The different antennas can be pointed by several means.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:go.ssd,GALILEO ORBITER STAR SCANNER for GO,GALILEO ORBITER STAR SCANNER,"       Instrument Overview     ===================     The Star Scanner is fully described by Fieseler, 2000, The Galileo     Star Scanner as an Instrument For Measuring High Energy Electrons     in the Jovian Environment, USC MS Thesis [FIESELER2000].         INTRODUCTION       The Galileo spacecraft carries aboard it a photomultiplier tube     based star scanner for the purpose of providing the spacecraft with     an inertial attitude reference. This device has been subjected to     the radiation environment within Jupiter's magnetosphere since 1995     and is providing measurements of the omnidirectional flux of 1.5 to     30 MeV electrons within about 12 Jupiter radii. The range of maximum     sensitivity is roughly 4 to 15 MeV. The star scanner is measuring     electrons in energy ranges similar to some channels of Galileo's     Energetic Particles Detector (EPD) but the star scanner operates     continuously thus providing a unique data set when EPD is not     operating.  The star scanner is generally not sensitive to pitch     angle distribution. There is no data prior to the spacecraft     reaching Jupiter.       The star scanner provides a single channel of data for measuring     electrons termed 'background radiation count' (or sometimes 'raw     background') along with other data on the health of the instrument,     brightness of stars in the field of view and time.         Calibration:       Before Galileo's launch, an attempt was made to shield the star     scanner's Photomultiplier Tube (PMT) from the particle environment     at Jupiter. The attempt was not entirely successful resulting in     this star scanner data set.  The conclusion that the star scanner is     sensing predominantly high energy electrons is based up multiple     arguments.       1. Two analyses of the shielding around the star scanner PMT     concluded that the star scanner should be effectively shielded from     electrons below ~ 1 MeV and protons of several hundred MeV. The flux     of such protons is generally much less than the  ~1 MeV electrons.       2.  Theoretical arguments [RUSSELL2001B] based on the fact that the     star scanner measures longitudinal asymmetries at a given     jovicentric distance. It is argued that these asymmetries would     quickly smooth out unless drifting more or less with Io. This     suggests ~10 to 15 MeV electrons.       3.  Qualitative comparison of star scanner data with Pioneer and     Voyager data. The star scanner measures a strong decrease in flux at     the Io L-shell similar to that seen in 5 MeV and 8 MeV electron data     from Pioneer. Although there are proton channels that show this     effect, they also show a noticeable flux decrease at the Europa L-     shell which is absent in both the Pioneer  5 MeV and 8 MeV electron     data as well as star scanner data.       4.  Quantitative comparison with Galileo Energetic Particles     Detector (EPD) data and Galileo Heavy Ion Counter (HIC) data.     Extremely strong correlations were found with the EPD DC3 channel     measuring > 11 MeV electrons. and with  the EPD B1 channel measuring     ~1.5 to 10.5 MeV electrons. A very strong correlation was also noted     with the EPD DC2 channel measuring > 2 MeV electrons.       5.  Pre-flight testing of the unshielded PMT found that it was     sensitive to ~1 MeV electrons.       Using the above analyses, it was found that the range of energies     the star scanner is measuring could be bracketed between 1.5 and 30     MeV. This, of course, does not imply that the star scanner would not     react to a 40 MeV electron or above. It is just that the flux of     these higher energy electrons drops off quickly with increasing     energy in the Jovian environment.  The star scanner response was     modeled using the [DIVINE&GARRETT1983] model for flux in the Jovian     environment which predicted that the > 80% of the star scanner's     response was caused by electrons under 30 MeV.       The star scanner is a linear detector at the lower fluxes (<1000)     but becomes non-linear at higher fluxes due to saturation effects. A     derived channel called 'compensated counts' is included which     corrects for this non-linearity and other deterministic biases in     the data.       Also using the above analyses, it is believed that the star scanner     is most sensitive to electrons in the range 4 to 15 MeV.  An attempt     was made to convert star scanner counts to a flux of electrons by     correlating against the EPD DC3 channel and the Divine Model.  In     all cases, a dependency on jovicentric distance was noted.       The equation:               Flux (#electrons cm*-2 sec*-1) = 1755 * CC * (RJ1.1208)       where RJ is radial distance from Jupiter, and CC is compensated     counts available in the star scanner text files. This conversion is     preliminary and thought to be correct only within a factor of five.     The corrected data from the star scanner (compensated counts) are     believed to be self-consistent; it is the conversion to flux that is     problematic.  Additional calibration work is on-going and will be     updated here as work progresses.         Operational Considerations:       There are several situations which create loss of data. The most     likely of these is extended periods of no station coverage. All     other period where the data is missing or suspect are noted in the     'notes' column of the star scanner text files. These include:       1. Brief periods (measured in minutes) near the point of closest     approach to a Galilean satellite in several encounters where the     star scanner shutter was closed to provide bright light protection.     The star scanner was not designed to return telemetry in this     condition.       2. Periods where the spacecraft antenna was turned sufficiently far     from the earth to cause loss of telemetry.       3. There is an operational mode termed 'OSAD' for One Star Attitude     Determination where only a single bright star is being intentionally     observed by the star scanner. This situation increases the noise in     the background radiation data noticeably but does not otherwise harm     the data.       4. Periods where Bright Body vectors were active. These are periods     during each rotation when the star scanner's is effectively shut     down to protect the photomultiplier tube from bright light sources.     These periods usually have no effect on the data set but, in a few     instances, can block a star from the field of view and thus reduce     the sampling of the data set.       It is noted that three of the four Io fly-bys appear to have     'spikes' of  increased flux right at Io closest approach. For orbits     I25 and I27 at least, it appears the star scanner was sensing bright     light reflected from Io rather than measuring a feature of the     environment. In other words, the bright body vectors were not     effective due to prior spacecraft anomalies. It cannot be ruled out     that these spikes don't partially or entirely reflect a feature of     the electron environment since a spike was apparently seen in the J0     orbit, nevertheless, this spiked data must be used with extreme     caution.         Detector:       There are two possible sources of the radiation signal within the     star scanner. Either direct electron stimulation of the photocathode     of the photomultiplier tube or light production by fluorescence     and/or Cerenkov radiation in the lenses that focus the light on the     photomultiplier. Pre-flight testing found that up to approximately     15% of the signal was expected to come from the lenses. This can not     be verified in flight as there is no way to distinguish the two     signals. This does not cast doubt on the fact that the star scanner     as a whole is detecting electrons as described above but it does     mean that no meaningful geometric factors can be derived for the     detector.       The PMT were specially modified by JPL starting with a 13 stage tri-     alkali off-the-shelf photo-multiplier tube supplied by EMR     photoelectric (model #549-01090). There are three lenses, but only     the crown glass Ohara SK18 is important as it is the least shielded     and closest to the photomultiplier tube. As this is the last lens in     the optical train, there is no focusing of any light generated     within this element. See [Fieseler, 2000] for more details.         Measured parameters and onboard processing:       The star scanner only provides the single measurement of radiation     in the unit of 'counts'. This actually is the average of 32 of the     most recent measurements that has been held in a special buffer.     Each measurement lasts for 3.2 milliseconds and are staggered by     four independent accumulators such that each measurement starts 0.8     millisecond after the previous. Thus the data that is downlinked is     actually an average taken over the previous 25.6 milliseconds. The     star scanner also provides the end time of this event, a code word     providing the health of the star scanner, the intensity of the most     recently seen star. Spacecraft twist information is also calculated     at the time the telemetry is prepared for downlink.         References     ----------     DIVINE&GARRETT1983           Divine, N. and H.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:go.ssi,SOLID STATE IMAGING SYSTEM for GO,SOLID STATE IMAGING SYSTEM,"           Instrument Overview       ===================         The SSI is a single-camera system based on an 800-line-by-800-         element solid-state silicon image sensor array called a charge-         coupled device (CCD).  The camera head, composed of a radiation-         shielded, radiatively cooled CCD, and supporting electronics, is         coupled to a 1500 mm optical system.  The optics subassembly,         inherited from the Voyager project and recoated to complement the         CCD's spectral characteristics, consists of an all-spherical,         catadioptric Cassegrain telescope operating at a fixed relative         aperture of f/8.5.           Scientific Objectives       =====================         The primary scientific objectives of the imaging experiment are to         investigate the chemical composition and physical state of the         Jovian satellites and the structure and dynamics of the Jovian         atmosphere.           Instrument Calibration       ======================         In-flight/radiometric calibration is implemented by imaging a flat,         solar-illuminated calibration target carried aboard the orbiter.         Stars or other celestial objects may also be imaged in support of         SSI in-flight calibration. To establish CCD dark-current correction         values, it is possible to read out SSI frames without prior         shuttering.           Operational Considerations       ==========================         Several practical constraints limit the degree to which the science         objectives can be met. The capacity of the telemetry link between         the spacecraft and Earth limits the acceptable data rate from the         camera, thereby placing constraints on the format size, encoding         level, and frame rate. These constraints are alleviated somewhat by         including 9 x 10**8 bits of tape recorder storage for onboard         buffering and by the capability for data compression in a ratio of         about 2.5:1. SSI pointing is accomplished by using an articulating         scan platform attached to the orbiter. This platform, while         extremely stable, does have some residual motions associated with         it. Smear considerations then influence requirements regarding         camera sensitivity, short shutter times, and filter transmission         and passband width. The harsh Jovian radiation environment         necessitates extensive shielding, particularly of the SSI sensor.         Rapid image readout onto the tape recorder is used to minimize the         buildup of radiation-induced noise. Power constraints limit the         rate of filter stepping permitted. Mass limitations partially         define the telescope aperture and the amount of radiation shielding         that can be used.         Detectors       =========           SSI         ---     DETECTOR_TYPE                 = Si CCD     DETECTOR_ASPECT_RATIO         = 1.0     MINIMUM_WAVELENGTH            = 0.404     MAXIMUM_WAVELENGTH            = 0.986     NOMINAL_OPERATING_TEMPERATURE = 163             The image sensor is a virtual-phase, buried-channel, frontside-           illuminated,  800-line-by-800-column charge-coupled device           developed by Texas Instruments, Inc.  The CCD employs a           polysilicon gate structure with 15.2 micrometer center-to-center           spacing between photoelements.  During image readout, all 800           lines are simultaneously shifted one line in the column (also           called parallel) direction, causing the first image line to be           shifted into the line transport (also called serial) register.             One of the most important parameters of an imaging sensor is the           thermally generated dark current. For any CCD there are basically           three sources of dark current (aside from local dark-current           blemishes, e.g., dark-current spikes): the surface component due           to the silicon/silicon dioxide interface states, the depletion           region component, and the diffusion component from the undepleted           bulk of the silicon.  Of these sources, the contribution from the           surface states has been shown to be the dominant contributor to           the dark current. For the virtual phase CCD, however, the surface           component can be significantly lower than that measured for other           CCD technologies. This is because, if the gate bias is held at a           sufficiently negative gate potential during integration and           readout, holes from the channel-stop regions will flow over the           surface of the imager area, suppressing surface state generation           in the clocked-phase regions as well. For such a gate potential,           channel inversion occurs.  The dark current measured under these           conditions for the 800 X 800 VP imager is 0.4 nA/cm**2 (at 25 deg           C), which is an order of magnitude better than other buried-           channel CCD technologies. At the SSI CCD temperature of -110 deg           C, the typical 0.4 nA/cm**2 level of dark current produces charge           at a rate of about 10**-5 electrons/pixel/s. With a noninverted           channel, dark current is typically around 10**-3           electrons/pixel/s for the SSI at -110 deg C.  The           signal-generation rate of dark spikes is not affected by channel           inversion and ranges from about 0.01 to 10 electrons/pixel/s at           -110 deg C.           Electronics       ===========         To maintain a wide dynamic range for this slow-scan camera system,         it is necessary, in addition to using a low-noise signal chain, to         suppress thermally induced CCD dark current.  To reduce the normal         dark current to an acceptable level for the longest SSI frame         readout interval, 60-2/3 s, CCD cooling to at least -70 deg C is         required. To keep the dark current small at localized sites of         dark-current blemishes, an operating temperature of -110 deg C has         been selected. This cooling is implemented through use of a         closed-loop, heater-modulated, radiatively cooled         temperature-control system.  The temperature controller maintains         CCD temperature to within 0.5 deg C of the design value over the         full range of view factors 'seen' by the thermal-control radiators         as SSI pointing is articulated.           The SSI has four operating modes for Phase 1 and five for Phase 2.         These modes are characterized by frame repetition rates of 2-1/3 s         with 2 x 2 pixel summation, 8-2/3 s, 30-1/3 s, and 60-2/3 s and an         additional 15-1/6 s for  Phase 2.  Each frame sequence is composed         of a prepare and a readout cycle. During the prepare cycle the         shutter is reset, the filter wheel is stepped if commanded, the         sensor is read out to reduce dark current, and the shutter is         activated to expose the image. The image readout cycle follows, and         the data are read out either into the onboard tape recorder for         later transmission to Earth or put directly on the downlink for         real-time transmission.           The video analog-to-digital converter (ADC) converts the analog         video data to eight bits. The SSI has four gain states commandable         on an individual frame basis by SSI control parameter words. The         lowest gain state is scaled to provide full-scale data for the full         well of the CCD during summation mode readout. The highest gain         state is scaled to provide full-scale data for a CCD signal of         10,000 electrons.           SSI image parameter control (including commandable selection of         spectral filters, exposure duration, gain state, and image readout         rate/mode), timing signal generation, pixel shifting and analog-to-         digital conversion, internal sequencing, and engineering and status         data acquisition are performed under programmed microcomputer         (~muC) control. The SSI ~muC is composed of an RCA 1802         microprocessor (~muP), a bus adapter to interface with the         spacecraft command and data subsystem (CDS), 3 kwords of read-only         memory (ROM), 3 kwords of random access memory (RAM), two 256-word         scratchpad memories, two input ports, and three output ports.           To enhance image data return over the available spacecraft-to-Earth         telecommunication channel, the SSI includes a block adaptive rate         controlled (BARC) data compressor and added an additional Integer         Cosine Transform data compressor for the Phase 2 mission.  By using         the BARC data compressor, 8-bit pixel data are compressed to an         average of 3.24 bits/pixel.  Because of the error sensitivity of         compressed imaging data, the SSI includes a Reed-Solomon coder that         is active whenever the SSI is outputting compressed data. Use of         Reed- Solomon coding provides virtually error-free data at a         telemetry rate for which an uncoded data link results in a         bit-error-rate of one in fifty.

Based on the CCD density of 65.6 elements per mm, the         angular resolution is 10. 16 ~murad per pixel.  Transmittance is         about 50% over the range of 400 to 1 nm.           Mounting Offset       ===============         The SSI is mounted on a two-axis scan platform, coaligned with         three other instruments: the Near IR Mapping Spectrometer, UV         Spectrometer, and Photopolarimeter Radiometer.

The Phase 1         operating modes are characterized by frame repetition rates of         2-1/3 s with 2 x 2 pixel summation, 8-2/3 s, 30-1/3 s, and 60-2/3         s. The Phase 2 includes an addition operating mode of 15-1/6 s with         2x2 pixel summation.  Normal mode refers to frame rates of once per         8.666 sec or slower. Normal mode data can either be recorded or         channelled directly for real-time transmission.  In the normal         modes the data can, if necessary, be compressed by a factor of         about 2.5 in either an information preserving fashion (lines may be         truncated), or in a non-information preserving (lines are complete         but pixel values may lose accuracy). Normal mode is distinct from         'summation mode'.

The frame time in summation         mode is 2.333 s or 15.1667 s (Phase 2 only), and in order to match         the read-out rate of the camera to the on-board tape recorder, it         was necessary to reduce the image format by the same factor.  The         SSI team chose an option in which adjacent pixels in the image are         summed (one 'summed' pixel equals four mutually adjacent pixels;         the resulting image is then in a 400 x 400 pixel format) during the         read-out of the chip.  The summation mode data must be recorded.

The Ultraviolet Spectrometer (UVS)       covers the wavelength range from 113 to 432 nm and was the original       instrument selected for the Galileo Orbiter.  The Extreme       Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV) was added to the Orbiter payload       after the Challenger accident in 1986.  The UVS instrument is       described in this document;  the EUV instrument will be discussed in       a separate document.         The UVS instrument consists of a Cassegrain telescope and an       Ebert-Fastie scanning spectrometer.  Spectral scanning is       accomplished using a fully programmable diffraction grating drive.       Three separate photomultiplier detectors, located in the exit focal       plane of the spectrometer, are used to cover the entire       ultraviolet-near-visible spectrum from 113 to 432 nm.  Spectral       scanning, instrument command and control, data formatting, and       spacecraft interface are all normally controlled by a microprocessor       within the instrument.  A hardware-controlled logic circuit, called       Cold Start Mode, controls scanning at power on in the event normal       commanding capability is inadvertently lost.  The UVS instrument       components are summarized in Table 1 and detailed in subsequent       sections of this document.

In order to measure accurate limb profiles, the telescope       has been equipped with an external sunshade and an extensive baffle       system for rejection of off-axis scattered light.  The field of view       is wavelength-dependent, being limited by the spectrometer entrance       slit to 1 degree by 0.1 degree for two of the detectors (G channel -       113 to 192 nm and N channel - 282 to 432 nm) and by one of the       spectrometer exit slits to 0.4 degree by 0.1 degree for the third       detector (F channel - 162 to 323 nm).  A bright object sensor (limb       sensor) with a 1.5 degree full width half maximum (FWHM) field of       view located below the telescope sunshade structure is used to       protect the long wavelength detector during atmospheric limb       observations.         Spectrometer     ============       The spectrometer is a standard, 125 mm focal length, Ebert-Fastie       design which uses a single spherical mirror as both collimator and       camera and a plane diffraction grating.  A ruling density of 2400       grooves per mm provides a first-order dispersion of 23.9 nm per mm       and an average spectral resolution of 200 for a 0.43-mm-wide       entrance slit (0.1 degree telescope field of view).         Spectral scanning is accomplished by rotating a diffraction       grating.  The UVS grating drive uses a moire fringe pattern,       generated by overlaying two radially etched transmission gratings,       to control the angular position of the grating.  One of the       transmission gratings is fixed, and the other rotates with the       diffraction grating housing.  The transmission gratings have a       ruling of 1500 lines per 360 degree rotation resulting in a single       cycle of 0.024 degree and a single phase increment step size of       0.00375 degree.  Each grating step for the UVS is a sum of six phase       increment steps or 0.0225 degree.  Thus a grating step results in a       0.1-mm displacement of the spectrum in the spectrometer focal plane       so that the spectrum is sampled on the average of 4 times per       spectral resolution element.         Three photomultiplier tubes, located behind three separate exit       slits in the focal plane of the spectrometer record the spectrum in       three overlapping wavelength ranges:  the far-ultraviolet detector       (G channel) covers the wavelength range 113 to 192 nm,  the       middle-ultraviolet detector (F channel) covers the wavelength range       162 to 323 nm, and the near-ultraviolet-visible detector (N       channel) covers the wavelength range 160 to 450 nm.  Each detector       has its own high voltage power supply and pulse counting       electronics, allowing for independent operation.  All three       detectors are mounted in a single mechanical housing along with       their high voltage power supplies and       pulse-amplifier-discriminators.  The G and N photomultipliers are       located directly behind their respective exit slits in the       spectrometer housing.  Volume constraints require that the F       photomultiplier be mounted above the slit plane and light is       directed to it by a small two mirror periscope located behind the F       channel exit slit.         Instrument Detectors     ====================       Three EMR Photoelectric Corp. 510 photomultiplier tubes, located       behind three separate exit slits in the focal plane of the       spectrometer record the spectrum in three overlapping wavelength       ranges.  Each detector has its own high voltage power supply and       pulse counting electronics, allowing for independent operation.       Photocathodes and windows for the detectors were chosen to optimize       measurements in narrow spectral ranges.  The far-ultraviolet       detector (G channel) is equipped with a magnesium fluoride window       and a cesium iodide photocathode resulting in a solar blind detector       with high sensitivity in the wavelength range 113 to 192 nm.  The       middle-ultraviolet detector (F channel) is equipped with a quartz       window to block radiation below 160 nm and a cesium telluride       photocathode to suppress its response to radiation from wavelengths       longer than 350 nm.  The near-ultraviolet-visible detector (N       channel) is equipped with a quartz window and a bi-alkali       photocathode and is sensitive to radiation in the wavelength range       160 to 450 nm.  The Voyager instruments experienced high radiation       noise, so additional aluminum shielding was added to the UVS       instrument.         Instrument Microprocessor and Electronics     ======================================       The UVS uses an RCA 1802 CMOS microprocessor for command parsing,       spacecraft time recognition and synchronization, and instrument       control.  In addition, the UVS design incorporates additional       electronics called the Cold Start Logic (CSL) that places it into a       cyclical F-G scan mode until microprocessor control is initiated by       spacecraft command.  The instrument receives commands and spacecraft       timing information via the Bus Adaptor and associated Direct Memory       Access (DMA) logic.  The Bus Adaptor serves as the bi-directional       interface between the Galileo spacecraft and the UVS.  Its circuitry       serves to isolate the UVS electrically from the spacecraft and to       allow for 8-bit information flow to and from the UVS.         Science Objectives     ==================       The scientific objectives of the Galileo Ultraviolet Spectrometer       (UVS) investigation include the following:         (1)  THE INTERPLANETARY MEDIUM: By carrying out a systematic program       of H and He measurements over the course of the mission, UVS will       improve our knowledge of the interstellar wind (ISW) and of the       processes that affect its passage through the solar system.         (2)  VENUS:  The geometry of the Galileo flyby permits pole-to-pole       and dawn-to-dusk measurements by the UVS of the abundance of SO2 in       the cloud-top region, and of the abundance of H, O, C, and CO in the       thermosphere.         (3)  EARTH AND MOON:  The post-encounter passage near the subsolar       point at long range allows the near-simultaneous measurement of       pole-to-pole and dawn-to-dusk variations in the UV airglow and in       reflected sunlight, allowing investigation of the global O/N2 ratio       and the distribution of ozone.  It is also of interest to establish       the Earth's UV albedo in the Schumann-Runge band region near and       below 200 nm.  A search for a tenuous lunar atmosphere using the       resonance emissions of H, O, and OH will address the question of the       rate of bombardment of the Moon by small bodies, and of the fate of       solar wind protons that strike the surface.  The flybys also allow       the Earth-Moon system to be mapped, and these data contain an image       from each encounter of the hydrogen geocorona from a unique sunward       vantage point.         (4)  ASTEROIDS:  The UVS measured the albedo of the asteroids Gaspra       and Ida during flyby.  Spatial resolution on the asteroid surfaces       was not possible, but their scattering properties as a function of       phase angle were measured, and the presence of absorption features       at wavelengths longer than 200 nm was determined.  At these and       shorter wavelengths the asteroid's albedo may be directly compared       to that of the Moon measured during the two Earth encounters.  The       data returned from Gaspra and Ida were limited to a few spectra.         (5)  JOVIAN CLOUDS AND HAZES:  The Galileo orbiting mission offers       the opportunity to observe Jupiter's clouds and hazes repeatedly       over a wide range of phase angle and wavelength.  Since its ability       to examine small scattering angles is restricted by solar protection       considerations, the contribution of UVS will be to determine the       imaginary parts of the aerosols' refractive indices by obtaining the       single-scattering albedo from photometric measurements.  It will       sample the lower end of the aerosol size distribution due to its       sensitivity down to 200 nm.  The distribution of aerosols with       altitude will be measured in the stratosphere by measuring limb       radiance profiles and in the troposphere by making nadir-to-limb       scans.  Temporal variability in the properties of clouds and hazes       will be investigated at time scales ranging from days to the       duration of the mission.         (6)  COMPOSITION AND CHEMISTRY OF THE JOVIAN STRATOSPHERE:  UVS will       use reflectance spectroscopy during disc and limb scans to compile       and inventory numerous hydrocarbons (such as methane, acetylene, and       ethane) as a function of location and altitude.  UVS limb scans will       yield stratospheric temperatures through the scale height of the       signal from Rayleigh-scattered sunlight.         (7)  JOVIAN THERMOSPHERE:  The thermosphere of Jupiter is       characterized by unexpectedly high temperatures (of order 1100 K in       the upper thermosphere) and by unexpectedly bright UV emissions from       molecular hydrogen.  Lyman-alpha  emission from H shows an       equatorial bulge that sometimes extends across the morning       terminator.  None of these phenomena have been totally explained.  A       careful study of spectral, horizontal, vertical, and diurnal and       other time variations is an important objective for the Galileo UVS       and EUV experiments, with the goal of gaining insight into these       phenomena.         (8)  JOVIAN AURORA:  Galileo's mostly equatorial orbits mean that       the aurora will be observed near the northern or southern limbs,       allowing excellent longitudinal resolution at the cost of lesser       latitude resolution.  The spectral effects of atmospheric absorption       will be enhanced.  Jupiter's rapid rotation will facilitate the       determination of longitudinal dependencies of the emissions on each       orbit.  The possibility of correlations between the aurora and       conditions in the Io torus will be explored.  Galileo will also       allow comparison of day-side and night-side auroral emissions.         (9)  JOVIAN SATELLITES:  While close-range observations of Io by the       UVS will be prevented by the radiation environment, Europa and the       outer two Galilean satellites will be visited a few times in close       encounters.  The Galileo UVS will measure and map the UV albedos of       areas of these moons.  The measurements will be compared with those       of the Moon and of the asteroids Gaspra and Ida.  The rich variety       of surface terrain and materials will greatly expand our knowledge       of the UV scattering properties of satellite surfaces.  The UVS will       also look for evidence of tenuous and possibly sporadic atmospheres       that might be produced by sublimation, sputtering by co-rotating       plasma, or even eruptive events.         (10) IO TORUS:  In conjunction with the EUV instrument, the UVS will       measure the abundance and distribution of the neutral and ionized       species existing in the Io torus.  Midnight/noon comparisons of the       torus plasma will be possible.  The surface and atmospheric       composition of Io and the nature and efficiency of escape and       ionization processes, as well as the complex interaction of the       ionized material with the magnetic and gravitational fields of       Jupiter and with the rest of the magnetosphere, will be       investigated.  The data are expected to reveal many dynamical       aspects of the torus in addition to its composition.         (11)  JOVIAN MAGNETOSPHERE:  There are many processes in the       exosphere of Jupiter, on the constantly irradiated satellites, in       the Io torus, and in the magnetosphere in general, that might       provide sources of neutral atoms in the magnetosphere, including H       and even OH in addition to oxygen and sulfur.  The UVS will search       for such material at times when the radiation noise in the       instrument is at a minimum.         (12)  JOINT INVESTIGATIONS:  Collaborative studies are planned with       the fields and particles investigators, with the goal to improve our       understanding of the transportation of sulfur and oxygen ions from       the Io plasma torus to their ultimate precipitation in the Jupiter       auroral region.  Joint investigations with the Photopolarimeter       Radiometer (PPR) experiment will help define the particulate       properties of the Jupiter atmosphere, providing constraints on cloud       particle size, shape, and composition.  Complementary UVS and PPR       observations will also provide information about the spatial extent       and altitude distributions of these clouds.  Properties of the       satellite surfaces will be measured in cooperation with the Near       Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS), the Solid State Imaging (SSI)       instrument, and the PPR.  Scattering properties as well as       ultraviolet absorbers, e.g., sulfur dioxide, will be measured to add       leverage to our understanding of the Galilean satellites.         (13) SHOEMAKER-LEVY 9:  The UVS obtained a unique 292 nm data set       during the impact of the SL-9 fragment G, showing a brief 'flash'       characterized by a brightness temperature near 8000K.         Operational Considerations     ==========================       The UVS instrument has operated nominally since launch.         Calibration Description     =======================       The Galileo UVS flight instrument  (Unit 0001) and engineering test       instrument (Unit 0000) were calibrated on the ground before launch.       Several documents and data files exist.  Inflight calibrations were       also obtained.  The Principal Investigator requests that, until the       end of the Galileo mission (EOM), any data users who wish       calibration information beyond that provided in the literature       should contact the UVS team.  Calibration documents include these       references:           1.  Galileo UVS Functional Requirement Document GLL-625-205,             4-2034, Rev A.           2.

(1992) [HORDETAL1992].           4.  'Galileo UVS Calibration Report #2', McClintock, W., May              1993, Internal UVS Team document.         [HORDETAL1992] lists the types of calibrations done before launch.       These include: instrument absolute sensitivity, telescope off-axis       light rejection, spectrometer scattered light, instrument       polarization, and spectral line shape and wavelength scale.       Spacecraft interface measurements were also performed;  these       included the limb sensor sensitivity and field of view and the       alignment of the UVS optic axis.  Other calibrations included       component calibration, such as the detector spatial response and       sensitivity.         The several inflight calibrations include cross-calibration       activities between the UVS and EUV instruments during the       Lyman-alpha All Sky mapping, Earth 1 and Earth 2 X-Cal observations,       and several boresight observations of the platform teams during the       cruise, Earth 1 and Earth 2 periods involving several stars.  Two       UVS star calibrations are currently planned during the Orbital       period.  Target stars have included: Alpha CMa, Eta UMa, Alpha Eri,       Alpha Ori, and Alpha Leo.  The Earth's Moon was also used as a       significant calibration observation during Earth 2.         Instrument Modes     ================       The Galileo UVS has two operating modes: Cold Start and       Microprocessor-controlled.  Microprocessor modes are different       between pre-Jupiter, called Phase 1, operations and post-Jupiter       operations, called Phase 2.  Generally there are also cruise and       encounter modes discussed as well within the Phase 1 and Phase 2       categories.  The instrument delivers 1008 bps to the Command and       Data System (CDS) Bus in all modes.         Cold Start is actually an automatic, or fail-safe, mode whereby       hardware circuits control the instrument's grating, or scanning,       operation.  Two full-wavelength spectral scans are performed using       the F-channel detector in its standard wavelength range (162 to 323       nm) and the G-channel detector over its standard wavelength range       (113 to 192 nm).  One RIM of time, the standard Galileo 'frame',       consists of fourteen spectra taken over 60.666 seconds.  Note two       factors: 1) the grating moves in the up (ascending wavelength)       direction during the first scan of a RIM and moves in the down       (descending wavelength) direction for the second spectrum; 2) 84       zeroes, representing one minor frame of 0.666 seconds, are produced       by the instrument at the BEGINNING of each RIM.         Microprocessor mode describes any time that the UVS microprocessor       program is controlling the high voltage and/or grating operation of       the instrument.  Originally designed for both recorded and real-time       transmission operations, the microprocessor program was modified,       slightly, for Phase 2 operations:  the major change for phase 2       includes the use of a CDS buffer to sum pairs of spectra for various       durations and then to dump the contents of the buffer to the       real-time telemetry stream, with occasional backup to tape.         PHASE 1       -------       The original Phase 1 microprocessor program, Version 5.1, allowed       for full scan modes with one or two detectors being used during a       scan pair, and for mini-scan modes where up to four selectable       wavelength ranges from one detector could be scanned up and down       during the 4.333 second scan period.  Two wavelength ranges were the       maximum ever used in this mini-scan operation mode, however.  As       noted above, the grating moves up and then down, even in mini-scan       mode.  If two detectors were used in mini-scan mode then the       detectors were changed only at RIM boundaries.         During Venus, Earth 1 and Earth 2 the UVS made full rate real-time       and recorded observations of these bodies.  They were generally full       wavelength scanning observations.  Two mini-scan exceptions were the       Venus observations and the Hydrogen line all-sky maps.         PHASE 2       -------       Microprocessor Version 6.1 is used for all post-Jupiter UVS       observations.  The two main distinctions of the Phase 2 UVS program       from the Phase 1 are:  a)  whether the data are being recorded or       are being summed (over time) by the CDS, and b) the movement of the       grating drive when in mini-scan mode is different between V5.1 and       V6.1 flight software.  In Phase 2 a Real Time Science (RTS) CDS       routine was added to sum pairs of UVS spectra into a CDS internal       buffer, called the Summation Buffer, in order to reduce the bits to       ground.  There are three summation periods which are dependent on       the downlink telemetry format.  The three periods are 29 RIMS, 59       RIMS, and 1 RIM less than 24 hours.  In each case, one RIM is used       to transfer and clear the buffer.  This RTS data format allows torus       data to be obtained during the tape (cruise) playback periods.  In       record mode the full UVS 1008 bps resolution is maintained on the       tape.         The order in which mini-scan wavelengths were sampled changed       between Phase 1 and Phase 2.  In Phase 1 mini-scan mode, each       mini-scan mode was performed for one spectrum and if a second, third       or fourth different position was commanded then the next mode was       performed in the next spectrum.  The next spectrum would contain the       third and the next spectrum the fourth.  This 1-2-3-4 pattern would       then repeat with the down wavelength pattern of 4-3-2-1.  A two       position mini-scan would repeat 1-2-2-1.  In Phase 2, pairs of       spectra always repeat in the up wavelength pattern.  The two       position mini-scan becomes 1-2-1-2.  There are no third and fourth       wavelengths in Phase 2.  This enables the CDS to sum consecutive       pairs of UVS spectra in the Summation Buffer.  Phase 2 operations       allow the second mini-scan to be executed with a different       detector.         In all cases, the detector and wavelength motion and direction are       sensed within the UVS housekeeping data in the instrument 'fiducial'       at the start of each spectrum.  The last byte of the microprocessor       program contains the software version number (times 10).

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:gp.asi,ATMOSPHERIC STRUCTURE INSTRUMENT for GP,ATMOSPHERIC STRUCTURE INSTRUMENT,"     Instrument Overview   ===================     From [SEIFF&KNIGHT1992]:       The ASI experiment will operate over an altitude range of about     870 km in two measurement modes, one to accommodate conditions of     high-speed entry at low ambient density; the other, the very     different conditions of parachute descent.  The entry mode begins     at a nominal ambient density threshold of 10^-11 kg m^-3     (presently believed to be about 750 km altitude above the 1 bar     level) where the Probe deceleration is expected to be about 15     micro g.  From measurements of Probe deceleration under the     action of atmospheric drag, atmospheric densities will be     derived.  The density profile is integrated above a given     altitude to define the pressure at that level, and the     temperature profile is then obtained through the equation of     state, given the variation of atmospheric mean molecular weight     with altitude.  This mode of operation is continued until the     Probe deploys its parachute, nominally at the 100 mb level (47 km     above the 1 bar level).       Then, during the subsequent parachute descent of the Probe to the     nominal end-of-mission depth at 16 bars, the thermal structure of     the atmosphere is defined by measurements of temperature,     pressure, and acceleration in descent mode.  Current estimates     are that the mission could extend to below 20 bars, perhaps as     deep as 25 bars.       At entry, the Probe is effectively a 48 km s^-1 meteor, enveloped     by a bow-shock wave and a thin shock layer of ionized,     luminescent gases at extreme temperature (~15000 K at peak).     Under these conditions, measurements of the ambient atmosphere by     means of conventional low-density sensors are clearly infeasible;     it is futile to extend sensors into the shock layer or through     the bow-shock wave, because they quickly burn away and, outside     the probe bow wave, develop shock layers of their own.     Measurements of atmospheric density by way of Probe     decelerations, however, provides a direct means of sensing the     atmosphere.       After the parachute is deployed, the heat shield is jettisoned     and temperature and pressure sensors are exposed to the ambient     atmosphere.  Acceleration measurements are continued, but at much     less frequent intervals, and in the absence of large vertical     winds, continue to define atmospheric density.  From the three     measured state variables, temperature, pressure, and density, the     atmospheric mean molecular weight may be determined.  Other     instruments on the Probe, including the mass spectrometer and the     helium abundance detector, will probably determine the molecular     weight more accurately, however.  In these circumstances, the     accelerometer data may be used to define the magnitude of large     vertical winds in waves or gusts.       Altitudes relative to any convenient reference level (e.g., the 1     bar level) are defined by the temperature and pressure data     integrated in the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium.  These     data will be used to establish the altitudes of measurement for     use by all Probe experiments.  They also define the rate of     descent, which is necessary to the analysis of Doppler wind     experiment.  In addition, atmospheric turbulence, radius to the     center of the planet, and Probe angle of attack are sensed or     derived.       The nominal end of mission, at 16 bars, is at an altitude of     about -120 km below the 1 bar level.  The vertical measurement     range of about 870 km will be covered in a little over one hour -     the initial 700 km in less than 4 min.  The time in descent on     the parachute at velocities from the order of 100 to 30 m s^-1     could be up to 75 min.       The instrument electronics perform a number of essential     functions.  They receive and execute commands from the Probe     systems and thereby set the experiment mode (calibrate, entry, or     descent), control the measurement sequences, select sensor     ranges, collect data from the three sensor sets, amplify signals,     perform A/D conversions, do some onboard data processing, and     condition instrument power.  The microprocessor controlled     electronics were designed and built by Martin Marietta Aerospace,     in Denver, Colorado.       This is a fourth generation entry probe atmosphere structure     instrument.  Its predecessors were used on the four probes of the     Pioneer Venus Mission, on the Viking Mission to Mars, and on the     Planetary Atmosphere Experiments Test (PAET) entry probe into the     Earth's atmosphere.  Best features of earlier instruments were     retained and some new capabilities have been added.       Scientific Objectives   =====================     (1)  To accurately define the state properties as a function of          altitude below the 100 mb level to ~20 bars. (They have never          been measured below the 1 bar level.)       (2)  To define the currently highly uncertain state properties of          the upper atmosphere.       (3)  To measure the stability of the atmosphere, and identify          convective layers and stable layers, where they exist.       (4)  To detect cloud levels from changes in lapse rate at their          boundaries.       (5)  To define state properties within the clouds, and thus provide          supplementary information on cloud composition.       (6)  To search for and characterize wave structures in the          atmosphere.       (7)  To search for and measure intensity and scale of turbulence in          the atmosphere.       (8)  To measure vertical flow velocities above a threshold of about          0.3 m s^-1.       (9)  To establish an altitude scale for use in correlating all          Probe experiment data.       (10) To define the probe vertical velocity, necessary to the          analysis of the Doppler wind experiment.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:gp.dwe,DOPPLER WIND EXPERIMENT for GP,DOPPLER WIND EXPERIMENT,"     Instrument Overview   ===================     Both the probe and orbiter were equipped with ultrastable     oscillators (USOs) for the purpose of generating/measuring a very     stable telemetry signal from the probe to orbiter.  The orbiter     measured the probe radio signal frequency every 2/3 seconds and     stored the frequency data on the tape recorder.  Half-resolution     data (4/3 second) were also stored in solid state memory.       Scientific Objectives   =====================     The Doppler Wind Experiment was designed to extract the zonal     (east-west) motion of the Galileo entry probe during its descent     into the atmosphere of Jupiter on December 7, 1995.       Calibration   ===========     During cruise, the probe USO was powered-on and frequency     stability measurements were made three times.  The in-flight     tests were the SFT (System Functional Test) and the MST (Mission     Sequence Test).  Although these tests had different goals and     performed under different protocol, for the purposes of the DWE,     the tests were essentially identical.       The measured drift rates of the probe USO were (all fractional     frequency drifts for 30 minutes following a warmup of 5.5 to 6     hours)       Project (pre-launch): 4.3e-10     1989 SFT: 1.09e-9     1990 SFT: 1.49e-9     1992 MST: 1.2e-9       From our analysis the best estimate of the fractional frequency     drift at the time of the probe mission is 1.73e-9 (30 minutes)     with an uncertainty of +/-.93e-10.       The magnitude of the orbiter USO drift was at least one or two     orders of magnitude less than the probe USO, so the     characteristics of the orbiter USO are almost completely     irrelevant for purposes of the analysis.       High Temperature effects:       Following the probe mission of 7 December 1995 it was discovered     that the probe interior reached temperatures well in excess of     the qualification and acceptance level limits, and pre-launch     calibration testing levels.  Therefore, in late 1996 at NASA     Ames, high temperature tests of the USO stabilities were     performed on the flight spare oscillators at temperatures and     temperature rates experienced by the probe during the Jupiter     descent mission.       After the post-flight high temperature testing of the flight     spare USOs was completed, two simple thermal models of the probe     response to the changing temperatures were made.  These two     different models 'best fit' the temperature-time curve in     different ways.  In the first (moderate thermal corrections) the     temperature-time curve for the USO thermal test was matched to     the actual measured probe USO data for the period 20 minutes     after entry to about 50 minutes after entry.  However, for this     model, the temperature peak was reached too early.  For the     second model (maximum thermal correction) the time of the     temperature peak was more consistent with the time of loss of     probe signal, but was several degrees below measured probe     temperatures from 20 minutes to 50 minutes after entry.  For this     model (maximum thermal correction) the temperature peak was     reached about 2.25 minutes earlier than the moderate thermal     correction model.       Under the assumption that it must behave like the flight spare     unit, the high temperature calibrations below were applied to the     actual probe data.       timee is time after probe entry (seconds) and delf_f is the 30     minute fractional frequency drift.       Maximum thermal corrections - drift model peaks at 59 min after     entry.                   if(timee(i).gt.2394.)delf_f=-.161e-8                 if(timee(i).gt.2503.)delf_f=-.593e-8                 if(timee(i).gt.2599.)delf_f=-.966e-8                 if(timee(i).gt.2703.)delf_f=-.122e-7                 if(timee(i).gt.2799.)delf_f=-.123e-7                 if(timee(i).gt.2900.)delf_f=-.994e-8                 if(timee(i).gt.2999.)delf_f=-.619e-8                 if(timee(i).gt.3099.)delf_f=-.427e-8                 if(timee(i).gt.3199.)delf_f=-.983e-8                 if(timee(i).gt.3299.)delf_f=-.308e-7                 if(timee(i).gt.3399.)delf_f=-.769e-7                 if(timee(i).gt.3499.)delf_f=-.157e-6                 if(timee(i).gt.3599.)delf_f=-.278e-6       Moderate thermal corrections - drift model peaks at 61.5 min     after entry.                   if(timee(i).gt.2398.)delf_f=-.565e-9                 if(timee(i).gt.2497.)delf_f=-.211e-8                 if(timee(i).gt.2593.)delf_f=-.538e-8                 if(timee(i).gt.2698.)delf_f=-.880e-8                 if(timee(i).gt.2794.)delf_f=-.108e-7                 if(timee(i).gt.2894.)delf_f=-.110e-7                 if(timee(i).gt.2994.)delf_f=-.911e-8                 if(timee(i).gt.3094.)delf_f=-.601e-8                 if(timee(i).gt.3194.)delf_f=-.425e-8                 if(timee(i).gt.3294.)delf_f=-.831e-8                 if(timee(i).gt.3394.)delf_f=-.246e-7                 if(timee(i).gt.3494.)delf_f=-.613e-7                 if(timee(i).gt.3594.)delf_f=-.127e-6                 if(timee(i).gt.3694.)delf_f=-.228e-6                 if(timee(i).gt.3816.)delf_f=-.400e-6                 if(timee(i).gt.3901.)delf_f=-.543e-6       At times earlier than 2390 seconds the USO drift rate is assumed     to be the nominal 30 minute fractional frequency drift rate of     delf_f = +1.73e-9.  The total drift in Hz (offset) is then found     from       ddt=timee(i+1)-timee(i)     offset=offset+delf_f*ddt*f0/1800.0       Note on 30 minute drift rate: To make meaningful comparisons of     the probe performance under different operating conditions, it is     useful to have a common baseline.  All of the probe pre-flight     tests and calibrations are quantified in terms of 30 minute drift     rates, and this is the reference definition.  Therefore, at any     instant of time, we define the 'instantaneous' 30 minute drift     rate to make references to the probe USO specs and predictions     easier.  Under severe operating conditions and a rapidly changing     environment, the 30 minute drift rate may well change minute to     minute.       Operational Considerations   ==========================     High temperature effects - see above.       The probe radio signal frequency was measured on board the     orbiter every 2/3 seconds.  The data were stored in a buffer in     the Relay Receiver Hardware (RRH) prior to delivery to the     orbiter.  Due to a slight timing mismatch between the RRH and     orbiter clocks, occasionally the orbiter would request a     frequency from the RRH just prior to a frequency measurement.  In     these cases the orbiter would measure a frequency of zero and     results in a discontinuity in the frequency-time profile of about     7 Hz.  To correct for this timing mismatch and the corresponding     null frequency measurements it is necessary to average through     the discontinuities.  This process, described in more detail     below, results in a frequency measurement period that is slightly     longer than 0.666 seconds.  For example, suppose N frequency     measurements (f_1,f_2,f_3,...f_N) are made at the N times     (t_1,t_2,t_3,...  t_N) where t_x - t_(x-1) = 0.666 seconds.  If,     due to a timing mismatch between the RRH and orbiter, frequency     f_k is discovered to be zero, then the remaining N-1 frequency     measurements are assumed to be uniformly distributed in time over     the time period t_1 to t_N.  In this case the times of the     remaining N-1 frequencies f_1, f_2, f_3 ...  f_N (with f_k     removed) are t_1, t_1+deltat, t_1+2*deltat, t_1+3*deltat, ...     where deltat = (t_N-t_1)/(N-2).       This is equivalent to averaging through the discontinuities.     Approximately 10 null measurements were experienced during the     reception of the probe data.       Additionally, there were several short periods when the tape     recorder data were not received.  Most of the gaps in the data     were filled in by the half-resolution data from solid state     memory.  In all, out of a total possible of 5173 frequency     measurements covering a period of 57 minutes, 28.66 seconds, 5015     frequency measurements were made.  The total missed data were 159     points (3.316%).  None of the missed points were consecutive.       Electronics   ===========     The frequency measured was the frequency of the RRH Numerically     controlled oscillator (NCO).  The NCO frequency is related to the     link frequency according to       f_link=57*f_uso + f_nco + 1024       where f_uso is the frequency of the orbiter USO (nominally     24.325553 MHz), and f_nco is the nco control word (frequency),     nominally 442455 Hz.       Due to the finite word length in the RRH buffer (24 bits), the     frequency measurement has an inherent digitization error.  This     finite word length leads to a digitization error of about .18124     Hz.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:gp.epi,ENERGETIC PARTICLES INVESTIGATION for GP,ENERGETIC PARTICLES INVESTIGATION,"     Instrument Overview   ===================     The Energetic Particles Investigation (EPI) instrument onboard     the Galileo Probe was part of the Lightning and Radio Emission     Detector (LRD).  The complete instrument consisted of four     sensors (RF antenna, 2 optical sensors, particle sensor) and a     central electronic box.  The EPI instrument was a two-element     telescope using totally depleted silicon surface barrier     detectors.  The instrument operated during the pre-entry phase of     the mission, when the Probe was in the configuration with the     heat shield still protecting the descent module.  Thus, the     measured particles had to have high enough energies to penetrate     the heat shield prior to their measurement by one of the 8     instrument channels.  The instrument was designed to handle     countrates up to 3 billion counts per second.  The data coverage     of the investigation consisted of three data samples acquired     near the equatorial region at 5, 4.1, and 3.2 Rj, and a     continuous series of measurements (12 data samples) from 2.3 to     1.25 Rj, which corresponded to a spatial resolution of about 0.02     Rj in the innermost region prior to Probe entry into the     atmosphere.       The EPI was manufactured in cooperation between the     Max-Planck-Institut fuer Aeronomie Katlenburg-Lindau, Technische     Universitaet Braunschweig, Bell Laboratories, University of     Arizona, University of Florida, NASA-Ames Research Center and     University of Kiel.  The weight of the EPI part was 0.5 kg, the     power consumption was 1 watt for 1 hour and the amount of bits     for data transmission was 7680 bits.       The EPI instrument was mounted on the descent module with its     viewing direction towards the thinner rear heat shield and its     telescope axis fixed with an inclination of 41 degrees with     respect to the probe's figure axis.       Scientific Objectives   =====================     The principal objective of this investigation was to study the     energetic particle populations in the innermost region of the     Jovian magnetosphere.  To achieve these scientific objectives the     EPI made omnidirectional measurements to get intensity profiles     with a spatial resolution of about 0.02 Rj.  In addition to the     omnidirectional measurement, sectored data were obtained for     certain channels.  For detailed description see Galileo Mission     Description.       Calibration   ===========     There has been a long series of detector calibration measurements     with radioactive sources over a period of 10 years to determine     the long-term stability of the detectors under normal and     thermal-vacuum conditions.  During the whole time from start to     end of the probe mission, the sensor box of the EPI flight spare     unit was kept under vacuum conditions to check the behavior of     the instrument.       For the higher energies, the instrument was calibrated with     protons at the Harvard Cyclotron (30-150 MeV), with electrons at     the Lawrence Livermore accelerator (20-30 MeV), and for heavier     particles (He, O, Si, Ar) at the Berkeley Bevatron (70-340     MeV/n).  The calibration measurements were performed in part with     a layer of the original heat shield material in front of the     aperture in order to determine the influence of the absorber on     the instrument's response functions.       Operational Considerations   ==========================     The EPI instrument was operated in the pre-entry phase of the     mission where it was difficult to get reliable information about     the magnetic field value from the LRD.  The data acquisition     scheme is based on the nominal probe spin frequency of 10.5 rpm,     which was achieved very precisely according to the Mission     Operations Final Report.       Detectors   =========     The EPI detectors were totally-depleted, circular silicon surface     barrier detectors with a thickness of 0.5 mm.  The detectors were     shielded by a tungsten aperture of 0.27 cm thickness forming an     opening angle of 73 degrees for detector A and of 44 degrees for     the coincidence of both detectors.  Having a sensitive area     diameter of 2.8 mm and a waver diameter of 7.2 mm, the edge     effect is of special interest for these detectors.  Evidence for     the influence of the edge effect was found in the energy loss     distributions recorded during calibration measurements     [FISCHERETAL1992].  Additional measurements with radioactive     sources were carried out to determine the detection efficiency of     the detector edges.  In parallel a mathematical model of the     detector assembly was developed for the investigation of the     physical details by means of a Monte Carlo method using the     computer code GEANT from CERN.  A model of the detection     efficiency was developed and validated by comparison with     calibration measurements [FISCHERETAL1992].  The investigation     revealed that the area of the detector edge was of the same order     of magnitude as the nominal sensitive area.  This is important to     know for a correct data evaluation.       Electronics   ===========     Detector telescope and analog electronics, for 2 separate     channels referring to detector A and B respectively, the detector     bias supply converter, and three housekeeping channels for     monitoring leakage currents in the two detectors and the ambient     temperature were contained in the sensor box.  The scaling, data     processing, and data formatting were executed together with the     Lightning and Radio Emission Detector (LRD) data in the central     electronics box.       The energy loss dE/dx in the detectors was used to set up the 8     channels as shown in the following table:            channel    dE/dx in detector A    dE/dx in detector B         ------------------------------------------------------            E1             >0.1 MeV                 N/A            E2             >0.1 MeV               >0.1 MeV            E3                N/A                 >0.1 MeV            P1             >0.6 MeV                 N/A            P2             >0.6 MeV               >0.6 MeV            P3             >0.6 MeV               >1.1 MeV            HE             >2.3 MeV               >2.3 MeV            HVY            >2.3 MeV               >24.5 MeV       Channels E1, E3 and P1 were single counter channels, all others     were coincidence channels.       For more details see [FISCHERETAL1980].       Operational Modes   =================     A total amount of 7680 bits was available for the EPI.  The     general approach was on the one hand to achieve for comparison     some measurements in regions of the Jovian magnetosphere where     already particle observations exist but on the other hand to     concentrate the main investigation to the innermost edge below 2     Rj.  The amount of bits was divided into 15 samples each with 64     words containing 8 bits, i.  e., 60 words for scientific data and     an additional 4 words for status information.  Starting the first     data sample at 5 Rj the subsequent samples were positioned at     4.1, 3.2 and 2.3 Rj.  At 2.3 Rj the continuous sampling started.     In case the phase locked loop circuit of the LRD was not able to     detect the magnetic field zero crossing, the data acquisition was     based on the nominal probe spin frequency of 10.5 rpm.  One Major     Frame Period (MFP) was 64 seconds.  There were two different     acquisition schemes for the first four samples down to 2.3 Rj and     the one following.  The two schemes are shown in the next two     tables.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:gp.gpms,GALILEO PROBE MASS SPECTROMETER for GP,GALILEO PROBE MASS SPECTROMETER,"     Instrument Overview   ===================     The Galileo Probe Mass spectrometer (GPMS) is an instrument     designed to measure the chemical and isotopic composition in the     atmosphere of Jupiter, including the vertical variations of the     constituents.  The measurements were performed by in-situ     sampling of the ambient atmosphere in the pressure range from     approximately 0.5 to 21 bars.  In addition, batch sampling was     performed for noble gas composition measurement and isotopic     ratio determination, and for sensitivity enhancement of     non-reactive trace gases.       The instrument consists of a gas sampling system that is     connected to a quadrupole mass analyzer for molecular weight     analysis.  In addition two sample enrichment cells and one noble     gas analysis cell are part of the sampling system.  The mass     range of the quadrupole analyzer is from 2 amu to 150 amu.  The     maximum dynamic range is 1.E8.  The detector threshold ranges     from 10 ppmv for H2O to 1 ppbv for Kr and Xe.  It is dependent on     the instrument background and ambient gas composition because of     spectral interference.  The threshold values are lowered through     sample enrichment by a factor of 100 to 500 for stable     hydrocarbons and by a factor of 10 for noble gases.  The gas     sampling system and mass analyzer were sealed and evacuated until     the measurement sequence was initiated when the Probe entered the     upper atmosphere of Jupiter.  The instrument weights 13.2 kg and     the average power consumption is 13 W.  Since the probe is not     pressurized the instrument is enclosed by a pressurized housing     made of titanium to save weight.  Pressurization (~1 atmosphere     of N2) prevents corona, condensation, and collapse of the     electronics package during the descent.       The instrument followed a pre-programmed sampling sequence of     8192 steps with a sampling rate of two steps per second.

Principal Investigator   ======================     The Principal Investigator for the GPMS instrument was Hasso B.     Niemann, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.       Scientific Objectives   =====================     The goal of the GPMS was the in-situ measurement of the chemical     composition of Jupiter's upper atmosphere down in altitude to     ambient pressures of 20 bar or more.  The instrument was designed     to detect gases but any solid or liquid that can be vaporized     will also be detected.  With in-situ measurements and sample     enrichment, the GPMS provides the measurements necessary to     address very fundamental questions of the origin and evolution of     the Jovian atmosphere.  It does this by measuring the abundance     and isotope ratios of 'major' (i.e.  mole fractions > 1.E-07)     constituents as a function of altitude with high accuracy.     Repeated species sampling during the descent permits the     determination of the altitude dependence of constituent abundance     and allows correlation with cloud layers, and the regions of     thermodynamic and photochemical activity.  The best precision is     achieved from the most abundant gases.  To search for trace     constituents at concentrations on the order of 1 ppbv, a sample     enrichment system has been added to the basic mass spectrometer,     and for noble gases a purification cell is included.       A mass spectrometer was chosen because of its impartiality.     Within its mass and sensitivity range it detects everything     admitted to it, and it is therefore ideal for an exploratory     mission like the Galileo Probe to Jupiter.       Calibration   ===========     The GPMS was calibrated before flight as described in     [NIEMANNETAL1992].  The procedure uses a high-pressure flow     system to provide gas mixtures to the inlet system entrance to     simulate flight conditions.  Temperature, pressure and gas     composition can be varied.       Operational Considerations   ==========================     In order for the electronics to provide the proper voltages for     successful operation the temperature must be within the operating     limits.       Electronics   ===========     Commands and timing events are accepted and processed by the     logic system.  The primary measurement is stored in an output     register for interrogation by the spacecraft telemetry system.       The instrument is under control of the programmer that is an     array of Read-Only-Memory (ROM) devices.  The programmer has an     8192-word, 16-bit look-up table and an output register to hold     the 16-bit word for the current data sample.  Each one half     second the ROM address is incremented and the instrument is     configured for the next measurement.  During each of the 8192 one     half second intervals, six instrument variables e.g.  mass     number, ionization energy, inlet system configuration, etc.  can     be configured to any allowable state.  The application of power     causes the instrument to begin executing a programmed 256 step     test sequence.  The instrument remains locked in this test mode     until the SEQUENCE START command is received from the probe.       Mass number selection in a quadrupole is a function of amplitude     and frequency of the RF (Radio Frequency) signal applied to the     rods.  Two frequencies are used to cover the mass range from 2 to     150 amu.  In each frequency range, the mass number is     proportional to RF amplitude.  The actual mass range is slightly     larger than this to allow scanning past the center of the peaks     in order to verify tuning and resolution.  A constant resolution     over the mass range from 2 to 150 amu is maintained by proper     choice of the DC and RF voltages.       The electron-beam ion source requires an electrode supply of     well-regulated voltages and a feedback controlled emission     regulator.  Three different ionization energies are programmer     selected and are accomplished by changing the appropriate ion     source potentials.  The ion source is provided with two redundant     filaments, powered by redundant emission regulators.  This     implementation simplifies the design and increases reliability.       A high voltage supply of nominal 3 KeV operates the     detector-multiplier.  Command capability to optimize the     secondary electron multiplier gain through the selection of one     of four values is provided.  The ion arrival rate of the detector     during each one half second of the descent constitutes the     primary measurement.  Pulse counting ranges from a rate of about     3E7 counts/sec down to rates as low as 0 or 1 count per half     second integration.  At ion arrival rates exceeding the upper     count limit the instrument will be desensitized automatically.  A     logarithmic (base 2) compressor is used with a 9-bit mantissa and     4-bit exponent.  This provides a full scale of 3.3E7 per range     and a resolution of one part in 512.       The electronics system was constructed of multi-layer printed     circuit board technology.  Weight and size constraints for the     Probe required that approximately 90% of the electronics     components be packaged in the form of multi-layer hybrid     circuits.  To meet structural requirements, the circuit boards     were mounted on a cross-web structure enclosing the quadrupole     analyzer and ion detector section.       Location   ========     The GPMS is centered in the Probe and the two gas inlets placed     near the apex of the Probe exterior shell.  The corresponding     exit ports are placed at a minimum pressure point inside the     Probe.       Operational Modes   =================     A detailed description of the GPMS pre-programmed data sampling     and processing has been described in [NIEMANNETAL1992].  Each     step is 0.5 seconds in length.  The full 8192 step sequence is     shown below.  Step 0 corresponds to GPMS internal time of 0     seconds.

The detailed final descent sequence is contained in the count     data file.       Subsystems   ==========     Several subsystems are part of the GPMS instrument:       A) Gas sample inlet and gas processing system     B) Pressure reduction system     C) Ion source     D) Quadrupole mass analyzer     E) Detector     F) Pumping System       A complete description can be found in [NIEMANNETAL1992].       A) Gas sample inlet and sample processing system       The inlet system consists of two fully self-contained units that     operate in time sequence as the probe descends through the     atmosphere.  Both units contain an ambient atmosphere flow system     whose gas inlet side is placed near the apex of the probe, and     whose exit ports are placed at the minimum pressure point inside     of the probe.  Ambient pressure at the exit port is assumed as a     worst case condition.  The pressure difference (approximately 6     millibar) between the stagnation point and the low pressure point     causes a flow past the pressure reducing leaks.  Inlet and outlet     ports are sealed by metal-ceramic tube and kept under vacuum     prior to entry.  They are opened in sequence after entry by     redundant pyrotechnic actuators.  The materials used for the     inlet system plumbing are primarily nickel and inconel.  A     silinizing process passivated the surfaces in contact with the     gas.  The solenoid-operated microvalves are manufactured by Aker     Industries of Oakland, California.  The inlet system also has     heaters to warm the gas and evaporate any condensates that might     clog the inlets.       The sample enrichment systems are an integral part of the ambient     atmosphere flow systems.  Atmospheric gas, after passing by the     direct flow capillary leaks, is also conducted to sample     enrichment cells.  The enrichment cells contain     zirconium-graphite getters for binding the reactive gases and a     porous carbon adsorbing material, Carbosieve (80-100 mesh,)     chosen to adsorb complex hydrocarbons.  The gas purification cell     is a small volume of gas, isolated by microvalves, and exposed to     a getter.  It removes the reactive gases, and allows a pure noble     gas analysis.  The hydrogen pressure in the volume is reduced by     approximately by five orders of magnitude and the remaining     partial pressure is determined by the equilibrium vapor pressure     of the hydrogen dissolved in the getter.  The gases absorbed by     Carbosieve Enrichment Cells are released by a programmed heating     cycle during the probe descent.  During these cycles the cells     are isolated from the flow system by the solenoid operated micro     valves and connected through separate capillary leaks to the     ionization region.  Two independent leak systems are employed for     sample enrichment.  The sample enrichment leaks for Direct Leak 1     can be isolated from the ion source by redundant ball closures to     prevent the ion source pressure from exceeding its optimum value,     and to permit repeated observation of system background pressure     after the initial sampling and enrichment sequences are     completed.  The second independent inlet system is opened to the     atmosphere after the first system has been isolated from the ion     source.  Prior to analysis the enrichment cells are heated to     approximately 200C for 5 minutes to desorb the gases.       B) Pressure reduction system       A small fraction of the gas flowing through the gas inlet system     is conducted through the pressure reducing leaks into the     ionization region.  The leaks, which are arrays of micron size     glass capillaries (typically seven capillaries per leak) with     inside diameters ranging from 1.5um to 6um, have a conductance     chosen so that the pressure in the ion source region does not     exceed 1.E-04 mb.  The Galileo Electro Optics Corp.  of     Sturbridge, Massachusetts fabricated the capillaries in a     proprietary process.  The gas flow path for Direct Leak 2 was     designed to minimize clogging of the capillary array by     condensable gases (e.g.  water droplets) through the use of a     droplet trap.  A similar feature was also designed for Direct     Leak 1.       C) Ion source       The importance of minimizing gas-surface interactions in the high     vacuum side of the sensor after the pressure reduction stage     requires that the ion source be very compact and an integral part     of the sample inlet system.  Electron impact ionization is used     in a miniature, dual filament ion source.  The second filament     provides redundancy and is turned on automatically should the     first filament break or burn out.  A collimated electron beam is     directed through the ionization region past the end of capillary     Direct Leak 2.  Sample distortion caused by gas-surface     interactions is minimized by directing the high-pressure flow     against the capillary leak and by locating the leaks in the ion     source so that the gas leaves the capillaries on the ion source     side directly through the ionizing electron beam.  The gas     emitted from the capillaries can now be ionized and analyzed     without experiencing previous surface collisions with the ion     source walls.  Direct Leak 1, the leak for the Enrichment Cell 1     and noble gas purification system are connected via short tubes     to the ionization region.  Chemical reactions on the surfaces of     the hot filament are minimized by isolation through narrow slits     and by separate pumping of the filament region.  The electron     beam energy is varied to permit species identification and     discrimination by observing spectra of fragmentation patterns at     several different electron energies.  Ions are focused into the     mass analyzer by a 3-element electrostatic ion lens system.       The pumping speeds in the flight system are limited by weight and     power restrictions that do not permit instant removal of the     gases from the ion source after they initially pass the     ionization region for Direct Leak 2.  A component of this     randomized gas contributes to the measurement.  The ratio of the     direct beaming to the randomized component strongly depends on     the system geometry.  A ratio of 5:1 was achieved with the ion     source design of the flight unit.  The most critical parameters     are the distance between the electron beam and the capillary     exit, and the cross section of the electron beam.  The     high-pressure operation of the mass spectrometer ion source is     limited by mean free path considerations leading to losses due to     ion molecule collisions.  A higher density in the ionization     section can be tolerated as a result of beaming because the     ionization volume in which this high density exists is extremely     small, having only a small effect on the ion path.       D) Quadrupole Mass Analyzer       The quadrupole analyzer filters the ion beam produced by the ion     source, transmitting ions of a chosen charge to mass ratio only.     The transmitted ions are focused onto a secondary electron     multiplier ion detector.  The radius of the quadrupole field is 5     mm and the field length is 150 mm.  Mass selection is     accomplished by application of radio frequency and static     potentials of varying magnitude to diagonal rod pairs.  The     selected mass value is determined by the relation m =     0.55xV/(fxf) where m is the mass in amu, V is the amplitude of     the applied radio-frequency voltage and f is the frequency in     MHz.  To allow voltage scanning over a sufficient amplitude     range, two separate radio frequencies were used, 2.83 MHz for 2     to 19 amu and 1.13 MHz for 20 to 150 amu.  The only dimensionally     critical element in the system is the precision rod assembly.     The rigid and compact design has been proven to be extremely     stable in previous flight experiments, and in vibration and     thermal testing.       E) Detector       A continuous dynode secondary electron multiplier detected ions     exiting the analyzer.  The multiplier was a rugged version of the     standard Model 4770 manufactured by Galileo Electro Optics of     Sturbridge, MA.  Charged pulses at the anode of the multiplier     were amplified and counted.  The background noise of the     multiplier was approximately one count per minute.  The upper     count rate of approximately 3E7 counts/sec was limited by the     multiplier anode pulse width.       F) Pumping system       The pumping system establishes a flow of sample gas though the     ion source at a particular pressure when a sampling device is     opened, and, after analysis and closure, removes the sample from     the ion source region.  Non-evaporable getter pumps and a sputter     ion pump are used.  The getter pumps are activated prior to     instrument delivery and required no further Probe power.  The     sputter ion pump requires only electrical power for operation and     has no moving parts.  Their use in the GPMS requires care,     because hydrogen and helium are the major gases in the atmosphere     of Jupiter.  Getter materials absorb hydrogen at a very high rate     but helium is absorbed very little, if any.  Sputter ion pumps     also pump hydrogen with high efficiency but hydrocarbons are     synthesized in the pump by reactions of hydrogen ions with carbon     trapped in the pump surfaces.  The effective pumping speed for     helium is usually small because of the low ionization cross     section of helium and the requirement that helium be buried     physically in the pump elements since it does not become     chemically bound or to go into solution like hydrogen.  This     requires sputtering of comparatively large amounts of cathode     material which tends to release larger quantities of gases     previously entrapped in the pump surfaces.  To eliminate the     synthesis of hydrocarbons in the sputter pump, a cascaded pump     system is used.  A high capacity baffled getter pump is operated     in cascade with a sputter ion pump.  The gas flow from the mass     spectrometer into the getter pump is conductance limited to     maintain a constant pumping speed during the measurement phase.     The getter pump absorbs hydrogen and other reactive gases before     they can reach the sputter pump.  Gases emitted by the pump must     pass back through the getter pump first before they can enter the     mass spectrometer.  Thus, their contribution to the gas in the     ion source gas is significantly reduced.  The preceding getter     chamber buffers small sputter pump instabilities.       The getter material used is sintered zirconium-graphite available     from SAES Getter of Milan, Italy (type ST171).  They are     activated by heating to approximately 900C for 45 minutes while     being connected to a laboratory pumping system.  The cathode     materials of the sputter ion pump are tantalum and titanium.  The     electrode geometry has been optimized to enhance the pumping     speed for helium.  Pumping speed is limited to about 2 liters/sec     at the flange.  The magnetic field of the sputter ion pump is 0.2     Tesla over an area of 35 square centimeters.  The yoke is     designed to minimize the stray field and magnetic shielding is     provided to the ion source housing to cancel the stray field of     the pump because of its location directly above the ion source.       Measured Parameters   ===================     The ion arrival rate from the mass analyzer into the detector     during each one half second of the descent constitutes the     primary measurement.  At ion arrival rates exceeding the upper     count limit of the discriminator/pulse-counter system the signal     is desensitized automatically.  The descent sequence also     contains steps where a desensitized mode has been pre-programmed.     The counting register value can be expressed either as     counts/sample-integration-period or counts/sec.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:gp.had,HELIUM ABUNDANCE DETECTOR for GP,HELIUM ABUNDANCE DETECTOR,"     Instrument Overview   ===================     The NASA Galileo mission to the planet Jupiter provides us with     the first opportunity to measure the He/H2 abundance ratio inside     a heavenly body and with high accuracy.  To this end, the Galileo     entry probe carries a miniaturized interferometer which is to     perform an accurate measurement of the refractive index of the     Jovian atmosphere, after removal of NH3, H2O, and CH4, in the     pressure range from 2.5 to 10 bar.  From these data the helium     mole fraction (about 0.10) can be calculated with an estimated     accuracy of +- 0.0015.  The instrument is called the Helium     Abundance Detector, or HAD for short.  It has a mass of 1.4 kg     and an electrical power consumption of less than 1 W.  Before it     can perform its measurements within the Jovian atmosphere, the     HAD instrument has to survive an in-space-storage period of more     than 6 years, a radiation dose of 75 krad and a deceleration     during entry into the Jovian atmosphere of approximately 300 g.       The Galileo Helium Abundance Detector uses a two-arm,     double-pathlength interferometer or Jamin-Mascart interferometer.     This type of interferometer allows for a particularly compact and     simple design.  The light source is a light emitting diode (LED)     operating at a wavelength of 900 nm.  An interference filter with     a 15 nm passband aids in producing near-monochromatic light.  A     Jamin plate produces two parallel and coherent light beams.  Four     cells, each of length l = 100 mm, house the Jovian gas and the     reference gas.  Additional optical elements are the collimator,     the inversion prism, and the objective.  The inversion prim is     very slightly tilted about an axis parallel to the incoming light     beams.  This feature, in combination with the objective produces     a well-defined interference pattern of consecutive equidistant     bright and dark fringes at a linear array of nine photodetectors.     This pattern does not change if both cells are filled with gas     mixtures having the same refractive index.  However, any     differences between the refractive indices of the Jovian and the     reference gas causes a continuous shifting of the pattern with     increasing pressure (that is, as the entry probe penetrates     deeper into the Jovian atmosphere).  The detector allows     measurement of the position and motion of the interference     fringes in multiples of 1/8 of the fringe separation.       The instrument carries a simple optical test device which allows     a measurement of the contrast of the interference fringes and a     verification of the operation of the fringe counter during     Earth-based tests and the interplanetary cruise of the Galileo     spacecraft.  It consists of a plane-parallel glass plate mounted     between the objective and the detector array.  By telemetry     command this plate can be slowly tilted up to about 30 degrees     about an axis parallel to the interference fringes at the     detector.  This causes a lateral shift of the interference     pattern across the detector array.       After entering the Instrument, the Jovian gas is passed through a     two-stage chemical absorber to be scrubbed first of traces of NH3     and H2O and then of CH4.  In addition, immediately before     entering the gas cells the Jovian and the reference gases are     each passed through heat exchangers made of stainless steel wool     to fully accommodate the gas temperatures to that of the     surrounding metal structure.       The reference gas consists of a mixture of argon and neon having     the same refractive index as a mixture of 11.1 percent He and     88.9 percent H2.  The reference gas is carried within the     instrument in a storage volume of about 20 cm^3 at a pressure of     25 bar.  During the descent into the Jovian atmosphere the     reference gas is released into its interferometer cells by means     of a membrane valve.  It keeps the differential pressure between     the Jovian gas cell and the reference gas cell near 75 mbar.  The     latter value is nearly independent of the total pressure because     opening of the valve is largely determined by the pressure     difference across the membrane (and the elastic constant of the     membrane).  This pressure difference is measured by a pressure     sensor within a few millibar to fully account for the influence     of this pressure differential on the observed fringe motion.       During launch and cruise of the Galileo spacecraft towards     Jupiter the entrance orifice of the instrument for Jovian gas is     closed by a thin metal diaphragm.  This diaphragm is designed to     burst upon reaching an outside pressure of 2.5 bar.     Subsequently, the ambient pressure actuates a needle device which     pinches a hole in a second diaphragm which previously had closed     off the reference gas in its storage volume.  Both gases are then     passed into the interferometer through capillaries which limit     the initial rate of pressure increase inside the interferometer     cells to 50 mbar s^-1.  Measurements are to continue until the     reference gas is expanded to the local ambient pressure which     should occur near 12 bar ambient pressure.  Recent calculations     of the descent profile of the entry probe predict that it will     take the entry probe about 28 min to descend from 2.5 to 12 bar     ambient pressure.  The fringe counter measures the motion of the     interference pattern starting from vacuum conditions through the     'in-rush' period near 2.5 bar ambient pressure and up to 12 bar.       The structure carrying the optical elements of the     interferometer, the gas flow elements, the storage volume for the     reference gas, 3 pressure sensors, and 4 temperature sensors is     machined from beryllium.  This material was chosen for its high     mechanical rigidity, low specific mass, and good thermal     conductivity.       To save energy, the LED is powered only for 0.5 ms at 64 Hz.     Also, the fringe position is measured 64 times per second which     allows the fringe counter to follow the fringe motions for     pressure surges of up to 750 mbar s^-1.  The average power     consumption of the HAD instrument is 0.9 W.       One telemetry data frame of the HAD instrument consists of 256     bits and is transmitted every 64 s.  It contains the content of     the fringe counter, the readings from 3 precision pressure     sensors, 4 precision temperature sensors, a number of     housekeeping channels and the analog signal of one of the     photodetectors.  The latter should enable us to obtain a     reasonable result from the HAD experiment even if the logic of     the fringe counter fails.

Scientific Objectives   =====================     The foremost scientific aim of the HAD experiment is to obtain an     accurate measurement of the He abundance in the Jovian     atmosphere.  This datum will more accurately define the small     difference between the helium mass fractions of Jupiter and the     Sun and the large differences in the He mass fractions among the     atmospheres of the giant planets.  Beyond that, the helium mass     fraction in the Jovian atmosphere represents an important lower     boundary for the helium abundance in the pre-solar nebula.  As     such, it also impacts on theories about the origin of the solar     system as a whole.       Calibration   ===========     The HAD instrument carries 4 precision thermistors TS, TR, TC,     and TF for temperature measurements in the range from -25 degrees     C to +40 degrees C.  With the help of the following electronics     the read-out from the sensors is made nearly linear between -10     degrees C and +15 degrees C, the range in which the telemetry     resolution is 0.2 degrees C (except for TF which measures the IR     filter temperature with a resolution of 0.8 degrees C).  The     absolute calibration of all four sensors is performed jointly to     an accuracy of +-0.5 degrees C.  During the first checkout of the     HAD instrument on its cruise towards Jupiter each of the TS, TR,     and TC sensors read a temperature within the range of +7.20     degrees C +-0.12 degrees C.  The spread of values is fully     accounted for by the telemetry resolution.       The sensors PS and PR measure the pressures in the gas cells in     the range from 0 to 20 bar, while the sensor PD has 400 mbar full     range.  The absolute sensitivity of each sensor was calibrated     against a rotating piston gage to within 0.1 percent of its     reading, as was the temperature dependence of these     sensitivities.  It turned out that the temperature dependencies     of the PS and PR sensors are negligible for our experiment.  The     temperature dependence of the PD sensor, however, needs to be     taken into account in deriving the helium mole fraction.  At an     indicated pressure of 100 mbar it amounts to change of about 3     mbar in the temperature range from -30 degrees C to +35 degrees     C.  Accounting for this temperature dependence, the     reproducibility of the pressure readings are within 1 mbar     throughout the expected operating range of the instrument.       The spectral intensity distribution of the LED/filter combination     was measured and the temperature shift of its centroid wavelength     determined.  The latter is            lambda (T) = (900.5 + 0.041 T) nm ,       with T in degrees C.  The temperature of the IR filter is     measured by the sensor TF, but its value is obviously not     critical.       A large number of absorber materials were tested but unexpectedly     could not find one which absorbed methane efficiently, but did     not absorb hydrogen.  The effect of hydrogen absorption is not     large, but measurable with the accuracy of our instrument.  This     effect was measured for many types of absorbers in a large number     of descent simulation tests.  These were performed with the HAD     instrument and covered the temperature range from -15 degrees C     to +25 degrees C.  1.3 g of silica gel was finally selected as     absorber for water and ammonia (absorber No.  1) and 1.15 g of     activated carbon as absorber for methane (absorber No. 2).     Additional tests using this absorber combination quantified the     required correction Delta aq_He of the measured helium mole     fraction for gas mixtures having q_He in the range between 0.008     and 0.014.  For a true He mole fraction q_He = 0.11 the     correction is            Delta aq_He = 4.0 x 10^-3 - 7.9 x 10^-5 T_a +- 5 x 10^-4  ,       with T_a being the absorber temperature, again measured in     degrees C.  The quoted uncertainty of this correction term is to     be taken independent of temperature and helium mole fraction in     the tested ranges of those parameters.       Verification of the value of 1q_He, the ratio of refractive index     differences, has been discussed in [VONZAHN&HUNTEN1992].  To this     end a great number of laboratory simulations of the descent of     the instrument into the Jovian atmosphere have been performed.     These consisted of mounting the HAD instrument in a high-pressure     chamber in which the chamber pressure, the temperature of the     mounting platform, and the temperature of the chamber gas could     be programmed to follow the values expected during the actual     Jovian descent.  Many of these tests were performed with all of     the burst diaphragms in place inside the HAD instrument, but in     the majority of the tests no burst diaphragms were installed.     For the development and calibration of HAD instruments, more than     500 such descent simulations were performed and evaluated.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:gp.lrd,LIGHTNING AND RADIO EMISSION DETECTOR for GP,LIGHTNING AND RADIO EMISSION DETECTOR,"     Instrument Overview   ===================     The Lightning and Radio Emission Detector (LRD) instrument will     be carried by the Galileo Probe into Jupiter's atmosphere.  The     LRD will verify the existence of lightning in the atmosphere and     will determine the details of many of its basic characteristics.     The instrument, operated in its magnetospheric mode at distances     of about 5, 4, 3, and 2 planetary radii from Jupiter's center,     will also measure the radio frequency (RF) noise spectrum in     Jupiter's magnetosphere.  The LRD instrument is composed of a     ferrite-core radio frequency antenna (~100 Hz to ~100 kHz) and     two photodiodes mounted behind individual fisheye lenses.  The     output of the RF antenna is analyzed both separately and in     coincidence with the optical signals from the photodiodes.  The     RF antenna provides data both in the frequency domain (with three     narrow-band channels, primarily for deducing the physical     properties of distant lightning) and in the time domain with a     priority scheme (primarily for determining from individual RF     waveforms the physical properties of closeby-lightning).       The LRD instrument has been designed to take into account large     uncertainties in the nature of possible Jovian lightning.  For     example, since Jupiter has no well-defined surface close to the     cloud system, there will be no cloud-to-ground discharges, which     are the best understood type of lightning on Earth.  Lightning in     general, and cloud discharges specifically, are very complex     physical phenomena and can generate a large variety of RF pulse     types and trains: unipolar pulses, bipolar pulses, asymmetric     pulses, groups and bursts of pulses.  The LRD instrument is     designed as a compact and versatile instrument which allows a     characterization of these signals with maximum sensitivity and     maximum dynamic range.  During the design phase, prototype     instruments have been intensively tested with Earth lightning     during several measuring campaigns.  The final instrument     characteristics have been set with acceptable margins for the     unknown conditions to Jupiter.       Modelling of the propagation of RF signals in the frequency range     of the LRD instrument in Jupiter's atmosphere shows that direct     propagation of signals will occur to distances of order 10^4 km     (Rinnert et al., 1979).  Hence, it is likely that Jovian     atmospheric discharges with the energy of a typical     cloud-to-ground discharge on Earth (order 10^8 J) will be     detected at 10^4 km or more distance within the atmosphere with     the LRD instrument.  As noted below, the LRD instrument also     includes a 'superbolt' channel, in order to count extremely large     events.       Hence, in light of all the above, the flown lightning detector     instrument must be designed to be as sensitive as possible,     limited only by spacecraft noise.  The instrument must also cover     as large a dynamic range as possible.       Principal Investigator   ======================     The Principal Investigator for the LRD instrument was Louis     Lanzerotti.       Scientific Objectives   =====================     Radio frequency measurements are made in a reduced mode of     operation at altitudes of ~5, 4, 3, 2 planetary radii from the     center of Jupiter.  These data are stored in the Probe memory and     then read out during the atmospheric descent phase of the     mission.  During the atmospheric descent, the full complement of     LRD data are acquired until the loss of the Probe signal by the     over-flying Orbiter and/or the demise of the Probe due to     atmospheric pressure and heat.       The RF data obtained in the magnetosphere will be analyzed also     jointly with the Probe Energetic Particle Instrument (EPI) data     to gain understanding of magnetospheric particle dynamics.  In     the magnetosphere, statistics on the characteristics of     individual waveforms measured during a sampling interval will be     accumulated at the four different altitudes.  In addition, noise     levels at three different spectral frequencies (3, 5, 90 kHz)     will be determined during the measurement intervals.       In the atmosphere mode, in addition to statistics on the     waveforms and the spectral noise levels at the three     narrow-banded frequencies, individual waveforms will be detected,     saved, and transmitted to Earth.  Such waveforms will provide     powerful additional diagnostic capabilities for Jovian RF     signals.       The LRD instrument, as noted above, has been designed to be as     sensitive as possible, limited only by the spacecraft noise, and     to be as versatile as possible, limited only by the imposed     limitations on power, bit rate, and reliability considerations.     It is within these constraints that the scientific objectives     will attempt to be achieved.  Extensive measurements with Earth     lightning have been made and these will be continued in order to     gain the maximum understanding of the operational characteristics     of the instrument, and therefore the maximum science from the     Probe descent through Jupiter's atmosphere.       In both the magnetosphere and atmosphere modes the component of     the Jovian magnetic field perpendicular to the Probe spin axis     will be determined.  These data will be used for analyses of EPI     data and for determining the spatial distribution of the sources     of some of the detected lightning signals.  Further, these data     will give engineering data on the Probe spin rate.       Calibration   ===========     Because of severe constraints as to weight and power for Probe     subsystems, the LRD instrument is very compact.  Further,     extensive on-board compression of the data is necessary because     of the limited available data rate.       All sensors and instrument characteristics, of course, have been     extensively tested and calibrated.  For example, radiation tests     were carried out on the sensor electronics and pressure tests     were made of the vented electronics box.  These latter tests     caused a stiffening piece to be added to the microprocessor chip.     The calibrations could be verified over long periods because of     the delays of the launch of the Galileo spacecraft.  A further     verification of the instrument parameters is provided by the     on-board implemented test generator (ITG).       Operational Considerations   ==========================     Magnetosphere mode.  The LRD instrument will operate in the     pre-entry phase at distances from the planet's center of about 5,     4, 3, and 2 Rj.  The instrument is switched on by the Probe timer     at these locations.  In this 'magnetosphere mode' the EPI is also     in operation.  As the Probe is still encapsulated within the heat     shield, the MS is less sensitive and the optical sensors are     covered.  The outputs of the LRD instrument are as noted in the     previous section, but without the waveform snapshots.  The     magnetosphere mode data set at each of the four locations     consists of a 64 byte data frame with statistics and the 3 kHz     spectral channel subdivided into parallel and perpendicular (to     the magnetic field) channels.  The data are stored in the Probe     memory for transmission during the atmospheric descent phase of     the mission.       Atmosphere mode.  When the LRD instrument is switched on at     descent the instrument begins with a test cycle (IFT) and the     first data set contains the test pulse data.  After that, the     instrument runs continuously until the end of the mission and     outputs a complete data set every four major frame periods, 256     s.  These data sets contain spectral data (the 15 kHz channel     being sectored), waveform statistics data, a 1 ms time interval     with a selected waveform, optical data and miscellaneous data     such as magnetic field component, spin period, and engineering     data.  The number of complete data sets achieved during descent     depends upon the length of time that the Probe survives and/or     the length of time that the Probe relay signal is successfully     acquired by the over-flying Orbiter.  For example, if the total     atmosphere data time is ~48 min, then 10 data sets would be sent     back (the 11th would be acquired but there would be no time for     transmittal).  The 10 data sets would contain one test data set     and 9 science data sets.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:gp.nep,GALILEO PROBE NEPHELOMETER for GP,GALILEO PROBE NEPHELOMETER,"   From [RAGENTETAL1992]:     Instrument Overview   ===================     The Nephelometer is designed to achieve the desired objectives by     comparing simultaneous measurements of the light scattered at     five angles from a well-defined volume of atmosphere in the     vicinity of the Probe with theoretical models of light scattering     from particulate matter.  A similar approach was successfully     used by Marov et al.  (1980), for measurements made from the     Venera Probes in the Venus atmosphere.       A cloud or haze is characterized by the way in which it scatters     light.  In particular, each unit of volume illuminated by a beam     of light will scatter the light at a given angle, theta, in     proportion to the product of the particle number density, n, and     the probability of the particles in that volume to scatter light     into a unit solid angle at that angle, the differential     scattering cross section, [d sigma/d Omega]_theta.  The     Nephelometer measured this quantity, at five angles.     Measurements are then compared with calculations of the same     quantities for model aerosols to obtain the best agreement with     the experimental data.  Results of such comparisons yield mean     particle sizes, particle number densities, and indications of     non-sphericity of the particles and/or absorption in the     particles.  The accuracy with which these quantities can be     determined depends on the accuracy of the experimental data and,     to a small extent, on the availability of subsidiary information,     for example hints or particle composition from other experiments     on the Probe.  A description of one method of performing such     comparisons to obtain the best fit to the data is given by Marov     et al. (1980).       The instrument contains the following components: (1) pulsed     solid state laser light sources, (2) solid state scattered light     detectors, (3) collimating, defining, collecting optics,     including a deployable axicon (axially-symmetric conical) mirror     system, and spectral filters, (4) optical alignment, surface     condensation and source output monitors, (5) other housekeeping     measurement systems to monitor instrument operation and     performance, and (6) analog and digital electronics circuitry and     power supplies.  The mechanical structure, deployment system, and     thermal design assure that the instrument will survive the severe     launch, cruise phase.  atmospheric entry, and descent     environments.       A number of complicating factors must be considered in the design     of the instrument.  For example, the required high sensitivity to     small scattered light signals and the relatively large background     light levels (up to 10^6 times as large as the minimum signal     levels), as well as the large dynamic range of expected signals     (of the order of 10^5 to 10^6), necessitate very careful signal     processing.  An irradiating light beam collimated highly enough     for the measurement of small angle scattering in the forward     direction, yet powerful enough to provide sufficient scattered     light for measurement of the relatively small scattering at wide     angles is required.  This requirement is further complicated by     the need to reduce instrumentally scattered light, the severely     limited space, and the need for reliable source operation after     an extended multiple-year cruise phase.  In addition, large     zero-signal baseline effects may be caused by electrical signals     induced by the operation of high power pulsed sources near very     sensitive detector circuitry.  There is a need to survive not     only the severe launch, cruise phase, and atmospheric entry     environments, but also the intense high-energy radiation in     passing through the Jovian radiation belts.  The effects of this     radiation on the reliability and stability of electronic     components and circuitry need to be carefully considered in the     instrument design.  Finally, there are the requirements of     relatively low allowable weight, space, power, and data rate.       Physically, the instrument is constructed in three parts, a     vented sensor head containing the forward scatter unit, a vented     sensor head containing the backward scatter configuration, and a     pressure-tight electronics unit containing the bulk of the     electronics.  A photograph is shown in Figure 1.  The scaled unit     is capable of withstanding pressures of greater than 20 bars with     negligible leakage.  The vented sensor heads, containing     components also capable of withstanding pressures greater than 20     bars, are connected to the electronics unit with cables     terminating in pressure-tight connectors sealed into the wall of     the electronics unit.  Both units are mounted onto the aft side     of the instrument shelf of the Probe.  The faces of the sensor     units are flush with the Probe skin, and the                                   TABLE I       Instrument characteristics.  The dynamic range for all channels     is approximately 10^6, and the mean source wavelength for both     forward and backscatter sources is approximately 904 nm.  The     effective sampling volume decreases for strong signals as the     number of sampled pulses is reduced.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Performance   Scatter channels       5          16         40         70         180                                                                   (Bkwd) Sensitivity, m^-1 sr^-1 cnt^-1  9.3x10^-7  5.1x10^-7  1.3x10^-7  1.5x10^-7  1.1x10^-8     Mean scattering    angle,  degrees     5.82       16.01      40.01      70.00      178.1     Angular resolution,    FWHM, degrees       0.64        1.08       1.72       1.76        4.0     Effective sampling    volume, 1           1.25        0.63       0.65       0.40       16.4   Physical description   Mechanical   Weight, kg       Sensor assembly                1.4     Electronics                    3.0     Total                          4.4   Dimensions, cm   Sensor assembly                  50.8 x  8.9 x 12.7   Electronics                      18.8 dia x 16.5   Electrical   Power, W     Instrument                     4.8     Heater                         6.5     Total                         11.33 average   Data rate                       10 bps   Data storage on Probe           800 bits   Data output                     a digital, 2 bilevel   Timing signals                  minor frame   Commands                        3 stored, 4 real time ----------------------------------------------------------------------       instrument is oriented on the Probe so that sampled volumes     extend out of the Probe essentially radially.  A 'closeout'     structure is used to seal the edges of the sensor faces to the     Probe skin.  A deployable arm containing the axicon mirror     segments, as well as the pyrotechnic pin puller that activates     the deployment mechanism, extends from the upper corner of the     top of the sensor unit out through the Probe skin.  This assembly     allows forward scattering sample volumes to be situated in     relatively undisturbed air, outboard of flow regimes near the     skin of the Probe in which aerodynamic effects may severely     modify the particle size distributions with respect to the true     ambient free-stream distributions.  Calculation of these effects     for the present case have been performed using modified methods     similar to those described by Chow (1979).  The detector external     windows and the axicon mirror assembly are electrically heated     continuously during Probe descent to prevent condensation of     atmospheric vapors.  During transit to Jupiter and the period of     high heating on entry into the Jovian atmosphere, the Probe is     immersed in the heat shield with the axicon mirror arm stowed in     its undeployed position.  Targets are mounted on the inner     surface of the heat shield, scattering fixed amounts of light     from the forward and backward irradiating sources.  This     scattered light is measured by the instrument, permitting checks     of calibration stability during the long test and cruise phases     of the mission, and shortly before entry into the Jovian     atmosphere.  Initiation of the Nephelometer experiment begins     after entry and deployment of the Probe parachute, removal of the     Probe from the heat shield, and deployment of the axicon mirror     arm.       Scientific Objectives   =====================     The objective of the Nephelometer Experiment aboard the Probe of     the Galileo mission is to explore the vertical structure and     microphysical properties of the clouds and hazes in the     atmosphere of Jupiter along the descent trajectory of the Probe     (nominally from 0.1 to > 10 bars).  The measurements, to be     obtained at least every kilometer of the Probe descent, will     provide the bases for inferences of mean particle sizes, particle     number densities (and hence, opacities, mass densities, and     columnar mass loading) and, for non-highly absorbing particles,     for distinguishing between solid and liquid particles.  These     quantities, especially the location of the cloud bases, together     with other quantities derived from this and other experiments     aboard the Probe, will not only yield strong evidence for the     composition of the particles, but, using thermochemical models,     for species abundances as well.  The measurements in the upper     troposphere will provide 'ground truth' data for correlation with     remote sensing instruments aboard the Galileo Orbiter vehicle.     The instrument is carefully designed and calibrated to measure     the light scattering properties of the particulate clouds and     hazes at scattering angles of 5.8, 16, 40, 70, and 178 degrees.     The measurement sensitivity and accuracy is such that useful     estimates of mean particle radii in the range from about 0.2 to     20 microns can be inferred.  The instrument will detect the     presence of typical cloud particles with radii of about 1.0     microns, or larger, at concentrations of less than 1 cm^3.       Calibration   ===========     Two methods were used to calibrate the Nephelometer.  The first     is similar to the method described by Pritchard and Elliott     (1960), as modified for application to the present case.  This     technique involves recording the response of each of the     scattering channels to the scattered light produced by a     diffusely scattering target positioned perpendicular to the     source beam optical axis, as the target is stepped along the     source beam until the sensitive volume for each channel has been     traversed.  For the forward-scattering channels a carefully     documented diffusely transmitting screen mounted into the end of     a set of telescoping tubes is used.  The transmitting screen     transmittance is carefully measured using a standard integrating     sphere and the screen's angular response and polarization     characteristics are documented with a specially constructed     goniometer.  Similar procedures are used to verify the     characteristics of a large specially constructed Lambertian     reflector that was used to calibrate the backward scattering     channel.  Calibrated neutral density attenuating filters are used     in front of the collecting optics for the detectors in each     channel to maintain the signals within the dynamic range of the     instrument.  The manner of relating the readings obtained using     this scanning method to the calibration constants to be used in     measuring actual aerosols is described below.       The Nephelometer instrument produces counts, C, in proportion to     the product of particle differential scattering cross section, at     angle theta, [dsigma/dOmega]_theta (with units of m^2 sr^-1), and     particle number density, n (with units of m^-3) with combined     units for this product, n[dsigma/dOmega]_theta of m^-1 sr^-1.     The proportionality constant is the product of source intensity     I_s, effective sampling volume V_eff, and     detector/electronics/optics gain constant K.  The instrument     count output C can be written as follows:        C = (KI_sV_eff)n[dsigma/dOmega]_theta = (1/E)n[dsigma/dOmega]_theta       and, the desired measured value,        n[dsigma/dOmega]_theta = CE = C/(KI_sV_eff) .       In response to a diffuse calibration target normal to the source     beam at position x, filling an effective area A_eff(x), and     having reflectivity (or transmission) at angle of T cos theta,     the instrument count output will be given by        C(x) = t(x) = [KI_sA_eff(x)] (T cos theta)/pi .       Because the normal calibration target is so bright, it is     necessary to reduce the amount of scattered radiation reaching     the detector with an attenuator of attenuation factor F.  By     moving this calibration target along the beam over all x at which     response is obtained, and integrating the response over all x, we     obtain       integral [C(x) dx] =       integral [t(x) dx] =       K(I_s/piF)(T cos theta) integral [A_eff(x) dx] =       K(I_s/piF)(T cos theta)V_eff    .       Thus, the proportionality constant E, in units of m^-1 sr^-1     count^-1, can then be evaluated from       E = (KI_sV_eff)^-1 =       T cos theta{(piF)(integral[t(x) dx])}^-1  .       In practice it is also necessary to make small corrections to     account for the deviation of the reflection or transmission     screens from true diffuse behavior, and polarization     characteristics of the sources, screens, and detection system.     The accuracy of this calibration procedure is a function of the     accuracy of our knowledge of the reflection (or transmission) of     the screen used to calibrate the Nephelometer and its simulation     of diffuse reflection (or transmission), the accuracy of the     measurement of the attenuation factor of the attenuator, the     accuracy of the data taken at each target position, and the     accuracy of the integration yielding the calibration factor.     Estimates of the overall accuracy range from less than +- 5     percent for the 5, 15, and 180 degree channels to less than +- 10     percent for the 40 and 70 degree channels.       The second type of calibration method involves obtaining the     response of the instrument to a well-documented 'standard'     aerosol environment.  These tests were performed in a large test     chamber at Particle Measuring Systems, Inc.  (PMS) of Boulder,     Colorado.  An aerosol with a very narrowly dispersed size     distribution was produced by atomizing a suspension of spherical     polystyrene or polyvinyl toluene particles into a large spherical     chamber.  The particle sizes were measured using standard     electron microscope sizing techniques developed for aerosol     research at Ames Research Center.  The density of particles and     the proportion of single particles to 'doublets','triplets',     etc., in the actual aerosol was documented using standard     particle sizing instrumentation manufactured and calibrated by     PMS.  Nephelometer responses were recorded for a variety of     particle sizes, particle densities and particle composition.  The     calibration for each of the scatter channels was then determined,     using Mie-scattering cross sections calculated for the     PMS-documented aerosol distributions.  In general, the results     obtained were within 30 to 50 percent (often within 10 percent)     of those measured using the first method.  However, the     variations in the results of repeated experiments in the particle     chamber indicated that the results were less reliable than those     of the target scanning technique.  Closer investigation indicated     a number of variables in the test conditions that were apparently     difficult to control.  For example, small persistent air currents     in the test chamber were present, produced during aerosol     injection, by thermal gradients, by the sampling of the PMS     instrumentation, or by other causes.  These currents introduced     inhomogeneities and differences in the particle densities as     measured by the test instrumentation and the Nephelometer.  In     addition, it proved to be difficult to produce an aerosol with a     low enough content of aggregate particles, such that these larger     particles did not appreciably affect the measured scattering     cross sections.  It was suspected that some of the particles     might also have been electrically charged and that electrical     effects, for example, at the chamber walls, may have produced     differences between the aerosol sampled by the PMS instruments     and the Nephelometer.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:gp.nfr,NET FLUX RADIOMETER for GP,NET FLUX RADIOMETER,"     Instrument Overview   ===================     The Galileo Probe Net Flux Radiometer (NFR) measured net and     upward radiation fluxes in Jupiter's atmosphere between about     0.44 bars and 14 bars, using five spectral channels to separate     solar and thermal components.  The instrument used an optical     head extending through the probe wall to obtain views of the     Jovian atmosphere.  It sampled upward and downward radiation     fluxes with a single 40 degree (full angle) conical field of view     chopped between directions +/- 45 degrees from horizontal.       The NFR consists of two major sub-assemblies: the electronics     module (EM), and optical head (OH).  The electronics module is     about 13 cm x 19.5 cm x 16 cm high, while the optical head is     about 8.5 cm x 8 cm high x 10.5 cm long.  The total weight of the     NFR is 3.134 kg, of which the optical head is 0.672 kg.  The     electronics module has four feet which are bolted to the Probe     instrument shelf.  The optical head, supported only by its     attachment to the electronics module, extends out of the Probe     through the Probe thermal blanket and aeroshell to allow the NFR     sensors to view atmospheric radiation.       The instrument was built by Martin Marietta Astronautics Group.     The principal investigator is Dr.  Lawrence Sromovsky of the     University of Wisconsin Space Science and Engineering Center.       Scientific Objectives   =====================     On December 7, 1995 the Galileo Probe Net Flux Radiometer made     the first in-situ measurements of radiative fluxes within     Jupiter's atmosphere.  The instrument's first targets were the     primary drives for atmospheric motions: absorbed solar radiation     and the flux of energy from the planet's interior.  Because solar     radiation absorption and planetary emission occur at different     places and altitudes, net radiative heating and cooling result in     buoyancy differences that force atmospheric motions.  An     understanding of Jovian circulation thus requires knowledge of     the vertical profile of radiative heating and cooling and its     horizontal distribution as well.       The NFR contributed to this understanding by measuring the     difference between upward and downward radiation fluxes, the net     flux, as a function of altitude during probe descent.  Because     the radiative power per unit area absorbed by an atmospheric     layer is equal to the difference in net fluxes at the boundaries     of the layer, the vertical derivative of the net flux defines the     radiative energy absorbed per unit volume, and thus defines the     radiative heating (or cooling) of the atmosphere.       However, because the Galileo probe provided only one sample     profile of Jovian atmospheric conditions at one location and     time, it is especially important to understand why the measured     radiative energy deposition occurs: we might then have some idea     of how to apply the results to other atmospheric regions which     were not samples.  The NFR experiment contributes to     understanding horizontal variations by making spectral     measurements which illuminate the mechanisms by which radiation     interacts with the atmosphere.  Five broad spectral bands were     used to separate the vertical distribution of radiative heating     by sunlight and radiative cooling and heating by exchanges of     thermal infrared radiation.  The profiles of radiation flux also     contain signatures of the substances that absorb and emit     radiation - gases and particulates, and thus provide independent     constraints on models of atmospheric composition and cloud     structure.  when these are interpreted with other probe     measurements and linked with orbiter observations they provide a     basis for using orbiter observations to extend radiative heating     determinations to other locations on the planet.       A full treatment of scientific objectives and results can be     found in [SROMOVSKYETAL1998].  Preliminary scientific results     were documented in [SROMOVSKYETAL1996].       Calibration   ===========     Calibration of the instrument was carried out at the University     of Wisconsin.  Details of calibration have been documented in     [SROMOVSKYETAL1992] and [SROMOVSKY&FRY1994].  The calibration     constants and algorithms used for the flight instrument can be     found in [SROMOVSKYETAL1998].       Operational Considerations   ==========================     Several special factors affected the quality of data acquired     during descent into Jupiter's atmosphere.  Among them were     temperatures outside the range of instrument calibration, and     thermal perturbations which we were unable to duplicate in the     laboratory.  Details of our treatment of these factors can be     found in [SROMOVSKYETAL1998].       Optical Head   ============     The optical head contains a rotating optics assembly, support     structure, apertures, reference blackbody sources and a position     control system.  The rotating assembly includes detectors,     field-of-view shaping optics, and heated diamond window, all of     which rotate as a unit between three different pairs of four     distinct angular orientations.  Because the rotating optics could     not structurally support a high pressure differential, the     interior of the rotating optics is designed to admit ambient     external gas during descent.       To inhibit possible condensation on interior optical surfaces, as     flow into the rotor is controlled by vents within the electronics     module and at the base of the rotor.  These vents take advantage     of the dynamic pressure distribution around the Galileo descent     probe to constrain gas flow.  Gas enters the probe through a     large vent at the back (aft) of the probe.  some of this gas     enters the electronics module through a molecular sieve filter at     the top of the electronics.  The filtered gas, also warmed (in     upper descent) or cooled (in lower descent) by the electronics     module, enters the rear of the optical head through a vent at the     base of the electronics module.  From this point the gas flows     partly into the rotor through the rotor base vent (near the rear     bearing) and partly through the motor and rotor bearings into the     forward part of the optical head and then through the apertures     into the external atmosphere.  The differential pressure driving     this flow is approximately 1 mb and at 1 atmosphere the total     flow rate through the optical head will be approximately 100     cc/sec.       When the optical system is not viewing external radiation, it     views one of two internal radiation sources: an ambient blackbody     source which is thermally coupled to the wall of the front     housing, and a heated blackbody source which is servo-controlled     to a temperature of approximately 107 deg C (the servo point is     attained in air or vacuum, but generally is not attained in He or     H2 atmospheres where high gas conductivity limits the blackbody     temperature to a maximum differential above the ambient     atmospheric temperature).       Detector Package   ================     All NFR spectral channels use LiTaO3 pyroelectric thermal     detectors to convert absorbed radiation power to electrical     signals.  The NFR detector package contains an array of six     detectors mounted in close proximity on a single circuit board.     Spectral filters are mounted in a filter frame which is     hermetically sealed to the detector circuit board, trapping xenon     gas in the volume between the detectors and the filter frame.     (All channels experience additional spectral filtering by the 0.2     mm thick diamond window at the entrance to the rotating optics,     the spectral reflectivity of the mirrors, and the spectral     response of the detectors.) The backfill of the very heavy xenon     gas is used to buffer the small amount of hydrogen gas which will     diffuse into the detector package during descent.  The buffering     effect maintains low thermal conductivity inside the detector     package and thereby eliminates significant thermal crosstalk     which otherwise would occur via gas conduction between detector     elements.  There are two filter frames: an upper frame containing     only a CaF2 long-wave blocker for channel C, and a lower filter     frame containing five spectral filters and one opaque blocker for     the blind channel.  Each pyroelectric detector element consists     of a crystal approximately 1 mm x 2 mm x 25 microns thick mounted     on 0.015 inch high mesas made of a vibration dampening material     called Visilox.  Black paint (3M velvet) is applied to the top     surface so as to cover the active (electroded) area but not the     entire detector.  The typical paint thickness is 20-25 microns.       Detectors have a primary thermal time constant of approximately     110 ms, an electrical capacitance of about 40 pF, and a     responsivity of approximately 1400 V/W.  In the laboratory the     dominant noise source is Johnson noise associated with the     detector load resistor.       Spectral Response   =================     The NFR made measurements in five parallel spectral channels.     Two solar channels provided complete integration of all solar     wavelengths from 0.3-3.5 microns (B) and a red-weighted subset     from 0.6-3.5 microns (E) in which methane absorption is most     significant.  A broadband thermal channel (A) from 3-200 microns     measured sources and sinks of Jupiter's thermal radiation as a     whole.  Channel C (3.5-5.8 microns) sampled the narrow band     5-micron window in Jupiter's atmosphere where gaseous absorption     is relatively low.  Channel D (14-150 microns) sampled the     hydrogen-dominated longwave region of the thermal spectrum.     Channel F is a blind channel that measured non-radiative detector     perturbations, needed to correct for similar perturbations in the     other channels.  None of the spectral channels has a flat     responsivity, and thus energy deposition profiles and heating and     cooling rates are somewhat model dependent.  To compute a heating     rate due to thermal radiation exchange requires a uniform     weighting of the entire thermal spectrum.  But since the spectrum     isn't measured, we must integrate the spectral flux density of a     model spectrum that leads to the same simulated NFR measurement.       Electronics   ===========     The NFR electronics consist of: digital circuits, analog circuits     (detector pre-amplifiers, post-amplifiers, demodulators and     integrators), gain select amplifier, analog to digital converter,     housekeeping monitors, motor driver, and optics position sensors.       Digital Circuits   ================     The microprocessor system consists of the 1802 CPU (Central     Processing Unit), 256 words of RAM (Random Access Memory), 6144     8-bit words of PROM (Programmable Read-Only Memory), nine I/O     (Input/Output) ports and a power-up reset circuit.  The RAM is     used to provide 256 bytes of temporary storage for data values     during data accumulation and manipulation.  The six 1-Kbyte PROMs     contain the program necessary to operate the instrument.  At any     given time only one of the PROMs is turned on and for only 1     microsecond of the 8 microsecond machine cycle, providing a     factor of 48 reduction of power consumption by the PROMs.  Six     8-bit wide output ports are used to control the non-digital NFR     subsystem.  Three input ports are used to read data from the NFR     subsystems.  The 2048 Hz spacecraft clock is divided down to a     4-Hz signal which is used to interrupt the microprocessor.  The     Minor Frame signal from the spacecraft is used to synchronize the     4-Hz timer and also to synchronize the software with spacecraft     timing.  The software does not begin cycling in its normal mode     until the microprocessor detects a Minor Frame interrupt.       The PROM software controls the sequence, timing, and duration of     motor control pulses.  After each cycle of the optical rotor,     position sensor phototransistors are read to determine if the     optics are at the correct position.  If any one of the 22 half     cycles of one instrument cycle results in an incorrect optics     position, the microprocessor notes this in the data stream by     setting the motor position error bit to one for that IC.       Analog Circuits   ===============     There are six channels of analog processors, one for each     detector.  Each channel includes a detector signal pre-amplifier,     a post-amplifier, a demodulator and an integrator.  This six     pre-amplifiers are housed in a hybrid package placed adjacent to     the detectors on the rotating optics.  The rest of the analog     circuits reside on two circuits boards within the electronics     module.       Pre-Amplifiers   ==============     Each pre-amplifier is a DC differential amplifier with a gain of     6.67, using U423 dual JFET inputs.  The effective input load     resistance of 0.909E+10 ohm (1E+10 ohm in parallel with 1E+11     ohm) in combination with the typical detector capacitance of 40     pF leads to a detector electrical droop time constant of 0.36 s.     with this droop a typical detector will generate an electrical     offset of 0.055 V per deg C per minute of thermal ramp.  Because     the load resistance is so much less than 1E+13 ohm detector     resistance, detector noise is dominated by the Johnson noise of     the load resistors (modified by the detector shunt capacitance,     of course).       Post-Amplifiers   ===============     The six parallel post-amplifiers each consists of three     non-inverting amplifiers in series (except for channels B and E     which have one inversion to compensate for an inversion built     into the detector package).  Single pole RC filters are used to     block the DC component from the hybrid and to tailor the     frequency response of the circuit.  The filter components are     chosen to give a maximum response at 16 Hz.  This may seem     strange in view of our fundamental 2-Hz detector signal.     However, this filter function acts somewhat like a     differentiator, which, in combination with the following     integrator, results in a very small sensitivity to the details of     signal transitions and a high sensitivity only to the final     values attained after each flip of the rotor.  This effect     minimizes asymmetry errors.       FET (Field Effect Transistor) switches at the input of each post-     amplifier allow the inputs to be grounded through a 100 ohm     resistor, providing a zero reading to be integrated as the Analog     Zero (AZ) data.  The AZ value is intended to be a measure of     offset in the integration circuitry.       The gain of the post amplifiers is tailored to the dynamic range     expected from each channel.  To extend the dynamic range of     channels A, C, and D, which receive much stronger signals from     the internal heated blackbody than they do from Jupiter's     atmosphere (at least in laboratory situations), the third     amplifiers of the circuits for those channels (and also for     channel F) have two possible gains selectable with a FET switch.     The gain is switched to 8 for analog zero, up flux, and net flux     measurements, and switched to unity for the blackbody calibrate     measurement.  The solar channels, B and E, receive relatively     weak signals from the on-board calibration source and thus do not     need gain reduction capabilities.       Demodulator and Integrator   ==========================     Each demodulator is a gain unity, reversible polarity amplifier,     the polarity of which is controlled by two FET switches,     synchronized to the 2-Hz NFR decommutation signal.       The integrator consists of an inverting amplifier with a 0.82     microfarad capacitor in the feedback loop and a 1 megohm resistor     connected between the output of the demodulator and the input to     the integrating amplifier.  A FET switch is placed in parallel     with the capacitor to short out the charge after a measurement     has been taken.  Two other switches control input to the     integrator.  In one configuration the output of the demodulator     is connected to the integrator (enabling integration); in the     other configuration the demodulator output is disconnected and     the integrator input is grounded (holding the integrated value     for readout by the A/D converter).       Gain Select Amplifier (GSA)   ===========================     All six integrator outputs and all housekeeping monitor outputs     are routed by a 22-channel multiplexer to the gain selection     circuits which properly scale those analog signals for input to     the Analog to Digital Converter (ADC)described below.  A     3-channel gain select multiplexer selects either the output of     the 22-channel multiplexer or the output of one of two cascaded     amplifiers, each with a gain of eight.  The three multiplexed     channels view the output of the 22-channel multiplexer at gains     of 1, 8, and 64.       Analog to Digital Converter (ADC)   =================================     The ADC is a 12-bit, +10 to -10 V, successive approximation type     converter, used over a +5 to -5 V 11-bit range only.  The most     significant bit (bit 11) indicates polarity of the signal, and     the second most significant bit indicates a positive or negative     overrange.  Data reported to the Probe telemetry include the     sign, two bits indicating the gain setting of the GSA, and nine     bits of data from the ADC (bits 1 through 9 - bit zero is     unused).       The microprocessor changes the gain of the GSA as required to     obtain an on-scale reading for the ADC.  The GSA is first set to     its maximum gain of 64.  If the processor detects that the ADC is     in an overrange condition (input greater than +5 or less than -5     V), it sets the GSA to a gain of 8.  If this also leads to an     overrange condition, the GSA is set to a gain of one.       Housekeeping Monitors   =====================     The following is a list of housekeeping data that the NFR reports     in the probe telemetry stream:             HB - Hot Blackbody Temp           A1 - Ambient Wall Warm Temp           A2 - Ambient Wall Cold Temp           DT - Detector Temperature           WT - Window Temperature           ET - Electronics Temperature           V1 - +10 Volt ADC Reference           V2 - +7 Volt Supply           BI - Hot BB Current           WI - Window Heater Current           G1 - GSA Cal for gain=1           G2 - GSA Zero for gain=1           G3 - GSA Cal for gain=8           G4 - GSA Zero for gain=8           G5 - GSA Cal for gain=64           G6 - GSA Zero for gain=64       The diode voltage drop change with temperature of a 1N4148 serves     as the temperature sensor for the DT and ET temperature monitors.     The HB, A1, A2 and WT temperature sensors are Fenwal GB38SM43     thermistors.  The HB sensor is located on the back of the hot     blackbody printed circuit resistor.  The A1 and A2 thermistors     are located in an aluminum mount on the ambient wall.  The WT     sensor is located in the window housing structure on the rotating     optics.  The DT sensing diode is mounted directly to the detector     board on the rotating optics.       Motor Driver   ============     The motor driver is basically a pair of 28-V H-bridge circuits     capable of driving up to 250 mA of reversible current through     each of the two motor coils.  The microprocessor controls the     motor driver by writing a one into the appropriate latch bit to     turn on one of two coils in one of two polarities.  In addition     to these four latch bits, there is one additional bit reserved     for controlling eddy current damping by shorting one of the two     coils.  The exact time and duration of each motor coil pulse is     controlled by the PROM software, and is tuned, prior to burning     PROMs, to obtain stable symmetric optical head rotation     characteristics.       To obtain stable rotor motion characteristics under varying     temperature conditions, the motor drive currents are stabilized     by a current regulator circuit.       Optics Position Sensors   =======================     The rotor gear on the rotating optics has four slots cut into it     so that four LED-photo transistor pairs mounted around the gear     can determine if the rotor is at 0, 90, 180, or 270 degrees (+/-     5 deg).  Only one photo- transistor will be turned on indicating     the position of the rotor.  If the correct transistor is not     illuminated, this condition is reported in the data stream by     setting the position error flag.       Operating Modes   ===============     The detectors, field-of-view shaping optics, and heated diamond     window all rotate as a unit between three different pairs of four     distinct angular orientations.  Besides the upward and downward     viewing positions, there are two horizontal positions, one     providing a view of an ambient blackbody, and the other providing     a view of a heated blackbody reference, both blackbodies being     located in opposite instrument walls.  In the Net Flux (NF) Mode,     the rotating optics chops between upward and downward views.  In     the Blackbody Calibrate (BC) Mode the FOV is chopped between the     ambient and heated blackbody references.  In Upflux Mode (UF),     the FOV is chopped between the downward viewing direction and the     ambient blackbody reference.  Time-integrated measurements are     returned every six seconds for all channels in parallel.  During     each 2-minute Data Cycle (DC) there are 20 Integration Cycles     (IC) during which decommutated, filtered, and integrated signals     are computed.  Among these there are 17 cycles of net flux     measurements, one upflux measurement, one blackbody calibration     measurement, and one analog zero measurement.  All chopping is at     a 2-Hz rate, and the decommutated signal integration generally     extends for 5.5 seconds (the first 11 of 12 cycles for each six     seconds).  The two net flux measurements following AZ and UF mode     measurements (as well as AZ mode measurements themselves) are     'short-cycled', meaning that only the last five cycles are     integrated, because of large DC level shifts after changing     operating modes.       Measured Parameters   ===================     The Net Flux Radiometer actually measures net radiance rather     that net flux.  This net radiance measurement is convoluted by     the instrument field-of-view and the non-flat spectral response.     A discussion of the relationship between measured net radiance     and true net flux can be found in [SROMOVSKYETAL1998] and     [SROMOVSKYETAL1992].       Timing   ======     NFR data can be related to data from other probe instruments via     the time after Minor Frame Zero.  This parameter is included in     all descent measurement files, for each data point.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:grail-a.lgrs-a,LUNAR GRAVITY RANGING SYSTEM A for GRAIL-A,LUNAR GRAVITY RANGING SYSTEM A,"       Instrument Overview     ===================         Radio science investigations utilize instrumentation with       elements both on a spacecraft and at ground stations -- in this       case, at the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN). The spacecraft part       of the radio science instrument is described immediately below;       that is followed by a description of the DSN (ground) part of the       instrument.         Instrument Specifications - Spacecraft     ======================================         Instrument Id                  : LGRS-A       Instrument Host Id             : GRAIL-A       PI PDS User Id                 : UNK       Instrument Name                : LUNAR GRAVITY RANGING SYSTEM A       Instrument Type                : RADIO SCIENCE       Build Date                     : UNK       Instrument Mass                : UNK       Instrument Length              : UNK       Instrument Width               : UNK       Instrument Height              : UNK       Instrument Manufacturer Name   : UNK         Instrument Overview - Spacecraft     ================================       The Lunar Gravity Ranging System (LGRS) instruments on board the       twin GRAIL spacecraft generate radio signals at Ka-band, X-band,       and S-band. The time and frequency of each signal is referenced       to its respective Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO).  The Ka-band       and S-band signals are captured by the other spacecraft, and       precise measurements of signal properties are recorded for later       transmission to Earth.  The X-band link is received by stations       of the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN). Operations are continuous       and simultaneous on both spacecraft except that the X-Band       downlink to Earth is only used when a DSN station is available.         The sinusoidal Ka-band link is used to determine distance       (range) between the two spacecraft from the phase of the       received signal. The modulated S-band signal is for exchange of       Timing and Time Synchronization (TTS). The X-band link is a       one-way transmission to the DSN via the Radio Science Beacon       (RSB).         Except for mounting differences, LGRS-A and LGRS-B (on GRAIL-A       and GRAIL-B, respectively) are identical.  Each is responsible       for working with its twin to send and receive the signals needed       to accurately and precisely measure the changes in range between       the two orbiters. Each LGRS consists of an Ultra-Stable       Oscillator (USO), Microwave Assembly (MWA), a Time-Transfer       Assembly (TTA), and the Gravity Recovery Processor Assembly       (GPA).         The USO provides a steady reference signal that is used by all       of the instrument subsystems. Within the LGRS, the USO provides       the reference frequency for the MWA and the TTA. The MWA       converts the USO reference signal to the Ka-band frequency,       which is transmitted to the other orbiter.         The function of the TTA is to provide a two-way time-transfer       link between the spacecraft both to synchronize and to measure       the clock offset between the two LGRS clocks. The TTA generates       an S-band signal from the USO reference frequency and sends a       GPS-like ranging code to the other spacecraft. The GPA combines       all the inputs received from the MWA and TTA to produce the       radiometric data that are downlinked to the ground.         Finally, each Radio Science Beacon (RSB) transmits an X-Band       signal to the ground based on its USO; the drift of the USO is       derived from the one-way Doppler data.           Science Objectives       ==================       The inter-spacecraft radio links and the X-band radio link to       Earth are used to generate a high resolution gravitational field       of the Moon.           Operational Considerations - Spacecraft       =======================================       GRAIL Primary Mission (PM) & Extended Mission (XM) operational       considerations         The GRAIL PM started on March 01, 2012 and ended on May 29,       2012.  The GRAIL XM started on August 29, 2012, and ended on       December 12, 2012, followed by decommissioning from December 12,       2012, to December 18, 2012. Spacecraft events for these phases       (for example, propulsive maneuvers, Ka boresight calibration       attitude maneuvers, telecommunication configuration changes and       the science Lunar Gravity Ranging System (LGRS) events) are       described below including their impact on science processing.         1)Propulsive Maneuvers         During PM, there were propulsive maneuvers for GRAIL-B but not       for GRAIL-A.         During the XM, weekly Eccentricity Correction Maneuvers (ECM)       were needed on both GRAIL spacecraft to correct rapid orbit       eccentricity changes due to large gravity variations at low       altitudes. The ECMs were between 5 and 15 m/sec and required       near radial thrusting which meant that the science measurements       were interrupted for about 15 minutes while the spacecraft       executed the ECMs. In the day following the ECMs a cleanup Orbit       Trim Maneuver (OTM) maneuver was executed if needed. The OTMs in       general were at the cm/sec level and science measurements were       not interrupted during an OTM.         The mass change history for both spacecraft can be found in the       MAS1A/B Level-1 products, and the thruster on-times are       available in the THR1A/B level-1 products. LGRS measurements are       taken during the propulsive maneuvers but it is recommended to       break science data arcs at the propulsive maneuver event times,       since the velocity changes imparted on the spacecraft are not       known with sufficient accuracy for science processing.

The angular momentum wheels apply torques on       the spacecraft by spinning up or down to maintain attitude. The       angular momentum wheels are only allowed to operate within a       specified wheel speed range. If the wheel speeds exceed the       specified range then attitude control thrusters (desaturation       maneuver) are used to apply a torque on the spacecraft to slow       or speed up the wheels, such that the resulting wheel speed is       within the specified range. In general the wheel speeds are       predictable, the desaturation maneuvers are planned in       advance, and the burns occur over the lunar poles. Since the       attitude control thrusters are not perfectly balanced, a       velocity is imparted on the spacecraft for every maneuver. The       velocity changes in general are small (< 5 mm/sec). LGRS       measurements are taken during the desaturation maneuvers but it       is recommended to break science data arcs at the desaturation       maneuver event times, since the velocity changes imparted on the       spacecraft are not known with sufficient accuracy for science       processing. A table for all desaturation events is shown below       for each spacecraft. The time reported in the table is the       average for all thruster activations associated with one       desaturation event. For detailed thruster on time histories see       level-1 product THR1A/B. The spacecraft mass change is very       small at the level of a few grams per event. For the December       2012 and June 2013 deliveries, the spacecraft mass change is not       accounted for in the MAS1A/B products, but it will be in future       higher version of the level-1 products.

After a GPA reboot the LGRS clock is synched with the LGRS clock       on the non-rebooting spacecraft using the TTS system. GPA       reboots will cause a gap in the inter-satellite range data       products (KBR1B, SBR1B) of about 2 minutes. In the tables below       all GPA reboots are listed.

The complete       history for the antenna change are listed in the VGS1B product       (S-band) and VGX1B product (X-band).         6) Ka boresight vector calibrations         During the primary and extended missions, the GRAIL spacecraft       were in nominal science attitude called orbiter point attitude       mode. For this mode the solar arrays of the spacecraft are       parallel to the orbital plane and the Ka boresight vectors (2.1       degrees off the -Z axis in the YZ spacecraft frame) are pointed       in the direction of line of sight toward the other spacecraft.       The GRAIL spacecraft remained in orbit point attitude mode       except during Ka boresight vector calibration maneuvers when the       spacecraft performed two orthogonal slews of 3 deg about the       line of sight vector between the two spacecraft. The tables       below are showing all the Ka boresight calibration maneuvers for       each spacecraft. LGRS measurements are taken during the       maneuvers but should not be used in the science processing       because the measured range change is the sum of orbit geometry,       lunar gravity, and range change induced by spacecraft attitude       variation. Ka boresight vector data contain range corrections       for the phase center to center of mass offset during the       maneuvers but these corrections are not reliable and should not       be used.

During the Prime Mission, other error sources dominated the       gravity field determination, but with the inclusion of the       Extended Mission, the temperature-correlated science       measurements will be applied.           Platform Mounting Descriptions - Spacecraft       ===========================================       Platform mounting is part of the instrument design. The       following antennas are mounted to each spacecraft:         - 2 S-band transponder antennas to communicate with Earth       (LGA1 & LGA2)       - 2 X-band beacon antennas for Doppler ranging measurements from       Earth of the Moon's near side (RSB1 & RSB2)       - S-band time-transfer system (TTS) antenna, which sends a       time-synchronization code back and forth between the spacecraft       - Ka-band ranging antenna for precision distance measurement       between the spacecraft         The spacecraft frame is defined such that the -Y axis of GRAIL-A       and the +Y axis of GRAIL-B point to nadir. The solar panels are       on the -X side of each spacecraft. The +/-Z axes of the       spacecraft are along the direction of flight.         The two S-Band transponder antennas are on opposite faces of the       spacecraft to provide full sky coverage. The LGA1 boresight is       along the -X axis of the spacecraft, facing in the direction of       the solar panels. LGA2 is on the opposite side, facing the +X       direction.         The two RSB antennas are oriented similarly, with RSB1 on the -X       side and RSB2 on the +X side. During the mission, transmissions       switch between the two in sync with the S-Band transponder       antennas.         The Ka-Band Antenna Assembly and the TTS are oriented along the       -Z axis of the spacecraft. Since these antennas point at each       other to form a communications link, one is always pointed in       the direction of flight while the other is pointed away. During       the prime mission, the direction of flight is along GRAIL-A's -Z       axis and GRAIL-B's +Z axis. During extended mission, they are       reversed. In addition, the antennae on each spacecraft are       rotated 45 degrees around their boresight, so that in the flight       configuration they form mirror images of each other. This allows       orthogonal polarizations to separate the transmit and receive       channels in the antenna.

Instrument Overview - DSN     =========================       Three Deep Space Communications Complexes (DSCCs) (near Barstow,       CA; Canberra, Australia; and Madrid, Spain) comprise the DSN       tracking network.  Each complex is equipped with several       antennas [including at least one each 70-m, 34-m High Efficiency       (HEF), and 34-m Beam WaveGuide (BWG)], associated electronics,       and operational systems.  Primary activity at each complex is       radiation of commands to and reception of telemetry data from       active spacecraft.  Transmission and reception is possible in       several radio-frequency bands, the most common being S-band       (nominally a frequency of 2100-2300 MHz or a wavelength of       14.2-13.0 cm) and X-band (7100-8500 MHz or 4.2-3.5 cm).       Transmitter output powers of up to 400 kW are available.         Ground stations have the ability to transmit coded and uncoded       waveforms which can be echoed by distant spacecraft.  Analysis       of the received coding allows navigators to determine the       distance to the spacecraft; analysis of Doppler shift on the       carrier signal allows estimation of the line-of-sight spacecraft       velocity.  Range and Doppler measurements are used to calculate       the spacecraft trajectory and to infer gravity fields of objects       near the spacecraft.         Ground stations can record spacecraft signals that have       propagated through or been scattered from target media.       Measurements of signal parameters after wave interactions with       surfaces, atmospheres, rings, and plasmas are used to infer       physical and electrical properties of the target.         Principal investigators vary from experiment to experiment. See       the corresponding section of the spacecraft instrument       description or the data set description for specifics.         The Deep Space Network is managed by the Jet Propulsion       Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology for the       U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

For design specifications on DSN subsystems       see [DSN810-5].         Subsystems - DSN     ================       The Deep Space Communications Complexes (DSCCs) are an integral       part of Radio Science instrumentation, along with the spacecraft       Radio Frequency Subsystem.  Their system performance directly       determines the degree of success of Radio Science       investigations, and their system calibration determines the       degree of accuracy in the results of the experiments.  The       following paragraphs describe the functions performed by the       individual subsystems of a DSCC.  This material has been       adapted from [ASMARETAL1995] and [JPLD-14027]; for additional       information, consult [DSN810-5].         Each DSCC includes a set of antennas, a Signal Processing       Center (SPC), and communication links to the Jet Propulsion       Laboratory (JPL).  The general configuration is illustrated       below; antennas (Deep Space Stations, or DSS -- a term carried       over from earlier times when antennas were individually       instrumented) are listed in the table.             --------   --------   --------   --------   --------          | DSS 25 | | DSS 27 | | DSS 14 | | DSS 15 | | DSS 16 |          |34-m BWG| |34-m HSB| |  70-m  | |34-m HEF| |  26-m  |           --------   --------   --------   --------   --------               |            |     |             |          |               |            v     v             |          v               |           ---------            |     ---------                --------->|GOLDSTONE|<----------     |EARTH/ORB|                          | SPC  10 |<-------------->|   LINK  |                           ---------                  ---------                          |   SPC   |<-------------->|   26-M  |                          |  COMM   |         ------>|   COMM  |                           ---------         |        ---------                               |             |            |                               v             |            v              ------       ---------         |        ---------             | NOCC |<--->|   JPL   |<-------        |         |              ------      | CENTRAL |                |   GSFC  |              ------      |   COMM  |                | NASCOMM |             | MCCC |<--->| TERMINAL|<-------------->|         |              ------       ---------                  ---------                                                       ^     ^                                                       |     |                    CANBERRA (SPC 40) <----------------      |                                                             |                      MADRID (SPC 60) <----------------------                             GOLDSTONE     CANBERRA      MADRID              Antenna        SPC 10       SPC 40       SPC 60             --------      ---------     --------     --------             26-m            DSS 16       DSS 46       DSS 66             34-m HEF        DSS 15       DSS 45       DSS 65             34-m BWG        DSS 24       DSS 34       DSS 54                             DSS 25                             DSS 26             34-m HSB        DSS 27                             DSS 28             70-m            DSS 14       DSS 43       DSS 63             Developmental   DSS 13           Subsystem interconnections at each DSCC are shown in the diagram       below, and they are described in the sections that follow.

The DMC is the center of activity at a DSCC.  The         DMC receives and archives most of the information from the         NOCC needed by the various DSCC subsystems during their         operation.  Control of most of the DSCC subsystems, as well         as the handling and displaying of any responses to control         directives and configuration and status information received         from each of the subsystems, is done through the DMC.  The         effect of this is to centralize the control, display, and         archiving functions necessary to operate a DSCC. Communication         among the various subsystems is done using a Local Area         Network (LAN) hooked up to each subsystem via a network         interface unit (NIU).           DSCC Antenna Mechanical Subsystem       ---------------------------------         Multi-mission Radio Science activities require support from         the 70-m, 34-m HEF, and 34-m BWG antenna subnets.  The         antennas at each DSCC function as large-aperture collectors         which, by double reflection, cause the incoming radio         frequency (RF) energy to enter the feed horns.  The large         collecting surface of the antenna focuses the incoming energy         onto a subreflector, which is adjustable in both axial and         angular position.  These adjustments are made to correct for         gravitational deformation of the antenna as it moves between         zenith and the horizon; the deformation can be as large as         5 cm.  The subreflector adjustments optimize the channeling         of energy from the primary reflector to the subreflector         and then to the feed horns.  The 70-m and 34-m HEF antennas         have 'shaped' primary and secondary reflectors, with forms         that are modified paraboloids.  This customization allows         more uniform illumination of one reflector by another.  The         BWG reflector shape is ellipsoidal.           On the 70-m antennas, the subreflector directs received energy         from the antenna onto a dichroic plate, a device which         reflects S-band energy to the S-band feed horn and passes         X-band energy through to the X-band feed horn.  In the 34-m         HEF, there is one 'common aperture feed,' which accepts both         frequencies without requiring a dichroic plate. In the 34-m         BWG, a series of small mirrors (approximately 2.5 meters in         diameter) directs microwave energy from the subreflector         region to a collection area at the base of the antenna --         typically in a pedestal room.  A retractable dichroic         reflector separates S- and X-band on some BWG antennas or X-         and Ka-band on others.  RF energy to be transmitted into space         by the horns is focused by the reflectors into narrow         cylindrical beams, pointed with high precision (either to the         dichroic plate or directly to the subreflector) by a series of         drive motors and gear trains that can rotate the movable         components and their support structures.           The different antennas can be pointed by several means.  Two         pointing modes commonly used during tracking passes are         CONSCAN and 'blind pointing.' With CONSCAN enabled and a         closed loop receiver locked to a spacecraft signal, the         system tracks the radio source by conically scanning around         its position in the sky.  Pointing angle adjustments are         computed from signal strength information (feedback) supplied         by the receiver.  In this mode the Antenna Pointing Assembly         (APA) generates a circular scan pattern which is sent to the         Antenna Control System (ACS).  The ACS adds the scan pattern         to the corrected pointing angle predicts.  Software in the         receiver-exciter controller computes the received signal         level and sends it to the APA.  The correlation of scan         position with the received signal level variations allows the         APA to compute offset changes which are sent to the ACS.         Thus, within the capability of the closed-loop control         system, the scan center is pointed precisely at the apparent         direction of the spacecraft signal source.  An additional         function of the APA is to provide antenna position angles and         residuals, antenna control mode/status information, and         predict-correction parameters to the Area Routing Assembly         (ARA) via the LAN, which then sends this information to JPL         via the Ground Communications Facility (GCF) for antenna         status monitoring.           During periods when excessive signal level dynamics or low         received signal levels are expected (e.g., during an         occultation experiment), CONSCAN should not be used.  Under         these conditions, blind pointing (CONSCAN OFF) is used, and         pointing angle adjustments are based on a predetermined         Systematic Error Correction (SEC) model.           Independent of CONSCAN state, subreflector motion in at least         the z-axis may introduce phase variations into the re",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The spacecraft part       of the radio science instrument is described immediately below;       that is followed by a description of the DSN (ground) part of the       instrument.

The time and frequency of each signal is referenced       to its respective Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO).  The Ka-band       and S-band signals are captured by the other spacecraft, and       precise measurements of signal properties are recorded for later       transmission to Earth.  The X-band link is received by stations       of the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN). Operations are continuous       and simultaneous on both spacecraft except that the X-Band       downlink to Earth is only used when a DSN station is available.         The sinusoidal Ka-band link is used to determine distance       (range) between the two spacecraft from the phase of the       received signal. The modulated S-band signal is for exchange of       Timing and Time Synchronization (TTS). The X-band link is a       one-way transmission to the DSN via the Radio Science Beacon       (RSB).         Except for mounting differences, LGRS-A and LGRS-B (on GRAIL-A       and GRAIL-B, respectively) are identical.  Each is responsible       for working with its twin to send and receive the signals needed       to accurately and precisely measure the changes in range between       the two orbiters. Each LGRS consists of an Ultra-Stable       Oscillator (USO), Microwave Assembly (MWA), a Time-Transfer       Assembly (TTA), and the Gravity Recovery Processor Assembly       (GPA).         The USO provides a steady reference signal that is used by all       of the instrument subsystems. Within the LGRS, the USO provides       the reference frequency for the MWA and the TTA. The MWA       converts the USO reference signal to the Ka-band frequency,       which is transmitted to the other orbiter.         The function of the TTA is to provide a two-way time-transfer       link between the spacecraft both to synchronize and to measure       the clock offset between the two LGRS clocks. The TTA generates       an S-band signal from the USO reference frequency and sends a       GPS-like ranging code to the other spacecraft. The GPA combines       all the inputs received from the MWA and TTA to produce the       radiometric data that are downlinked to the ground.         Finally, each Radio Science Beacon (RSB) transmits an X-Band       signal to the ground based on its USO; the drift of the USO is       derived from the one-way Doppler data.           Science Objectives       ==================       The inter-spacecraft radio links and the X-band radio link to       Earth are used to generate a high resolution gravitational field       of the Moon.           Operational Considerations - Spacecraft       =======================================       GRAIL Primary Mission (PM) & Extended Mission (XM) operational       considerations         The GRAIL PM started on March 01, 2012 and ended on May 29,       2012.  The GRAIL XM started on August 29, 2012, and ended on       December 12, 2012, followed by decommissioning from December 12,       2012, to December 18, 2012. Spacecraft events for these phases       (for example, propulsive maneuvers, Ka boresight calibration       attitude maneuvers, telecommunication configuration changes and       the science Lunar Gravity Ranging System (LGRS) events) are       described below including their impact on science processing.         1)Propulsive Maneuvers         During PM, there were propulsive maneuvers for GRAIL-B but not       for GRAIL-A.         During the XM, weekly Eccentricity Correction Maneuvers (ECM)       were needed on both GRAIL spacecraft to correct rapid orbit       eccentricity changes due to large gravity variations at low       altitudes. The ECMs were between 5 and 15 m/sec and required       near radial thrusting which meant that the science measurements       were interrupted for about 15 minutes while the spacecraft       executed the ECMs. In the day following the ECMs a cleanup Orbit       Trim Maneuver (OTM) maneuver was executed if needed. The OTMs in       general were at the cm/sec level and science measurements were       not interrupted during an OTM.         The mass change history for both spacecraft can be found in the       MAS1A/B Level-1 products and the thruster on-times are available       in the THR1A/B level-1 products. LGRS measurements are taken       during the propulsive maneuvers but it is recommended to break       science data arcs at the propulsive maneuver event times, since       the velocity changes imparted on the spacecraft are not known       with sufficient accuracy for science processing.

The angular momentum wheels apply torques on       the spacecraft by spinning up or down to maintain attitude. The       angular momentum wheels are only allowed to operate within a       specified wheel speed range. If the wheel speeds exceed the       specified range then attitude control thrusters (desaturation       maneuver) are used to apply a torque on the spacecraft to slow       or speed up the wheels, such that the resulting wheel speed is       within the specified range. In general the wheel speeds are       predictable, the desaturation maneuvers are planned in       advance, and the burns occur over the lunar poles. Since the       attitude control thrusters are not perfectly balanced, a       velocity is imparted on the spacecraft for every maneuver. The       velocity changes in general are small (< 5 mm/sec). LGRS       measurements are taken during the desaturation maneuvers but it       is recommended to break science data arcs at the desaturation       maneuver event times, since the velocity changes imparted on the       spacecraft are not known with sufficient accuracy for science       processing. A table for all desaturation events is shown below       for each spacecraft. The time reported in the table is the       average for all thruster activations associated with one       desaturation event. For detailed thruster on time histories see       level-1 product THR1A/B. The spacecraft mass change is very       small at the level of a few grams per event. For the December       2012 and June 2013 deliveries, the spacecraft mass change is not       accounted for in the MAS1A/B products, but it will be in future       higher version of the level-1 products.

After a GPA reboot the LGRS clock is synched with the LGRS clock       on the non-rebooting spacecraft using the TTS system. GPA       reboots will cause a gap in the inter-satellite range data       products (KBR1B, SBR1B) of about 2 minutes. In the tables below       all GPA reboots are listed. The reboot times are approximate and       can be off as much as 30 seconds.

The TTS ranging measurement       is not affected, but the relative LGRS clock reconstruction       analysis needs to be restarted at a phase reset. In the table       below all S-band phase resets during PM are listed. There were       no S-band phase resets in XM.

The complete       history for the antenna change are listed in the VGS1B product       (S-band) and VGX1B product (X-band).         6) Ka boresight vector calibrations         During the primary and extended missions, the GRAIL spacecraft       were in nominal science attitude called orbiter point attitude       mode. For this mode the solar arrays of the spacecraft are       parallel to the orbital plane and the Ka boresight vectors (2.1       degrees off the -Z axis in the YZ spacecraft frame) are pointed       in the direction of line of sight toward the other spacecraft.       The GRAIL spacecraft remained in orbit point attitude mode       except during Ka boresight vector calibration maneuvers when the       spacecraft performed two orthogonal slews of 3 deg about the       line of sight vector between the two spacecraft. The tables       below are showing all the Ka boresight calibration maneuvers for       each spacecraft. LGRS measurements are taken during the       maneuvers but should not be used in the science processing       because the measured range change is the sum of orbit geometry,       lunar gravity, and range change induced by spacecraft attitude       variation. Ka boresight vector data contain range corrections       for the phase center to center of mass offset during the       maneuvers but these corrections are not reliable and should not       be used.

During the Prime Mission, other error sources dominated the       gravity field determination, but with the inclusion of the       Extended Mission, the temperature-correlated science       measurements will be applied.           Platform Mounting Descriptions - Spacecraft       ===========================================       Platform mounting is part of the instrument design. The       following antennas are mounted to each spacecraft:         - 2 S-band transponder antennas to communicate with Earth       (LGA1 & LGA2)       - 2 X-band beacon antennas for Doppler ranging measurements from       Earth of the Moon's near side (RSB1 & RSB2)       - S-band time-transfer system (TTS) antenna, which sends a       time-synchronization code back and forth between the spacecraft       - Ka-band ranging antenna for precision distance measurement       between the spacecraft         The spacecraft frame is defined such that the -Y axis of GRAIL-A       and the +Y axis of GRAIL-B point to nadir. The solar panels are       on the -X side of each spacecraft. The +/-Z axes of the       spacecraft are along the direction of flight.         The two S-Band transponder antennas are on opposite faces of the       spacecraft to provide full sky coverage. The LGA1 boresight is       along the -X axis of the spacecraft, facing in the direction of       the solar panels. LGA2 is on the opposite side, facing the +X       direction.         The two RSB antennas are oriented similarly, with RSB1 on the -X       side and RSB2 on the +X side. During the mission, transmissions       switch between the two in sync with the S-Band transponder       antennas.         The Ka-Band Antenna Assembly and the TTS are oriented along the       -Z axis of the spacecraft. Since these antennas point at each       other to form a communications link, one is always pointed in       the direction of flight while the other is pointed away. During       the prime mission, the direction of flight is along GRAIL-A's -Z       axis and GRAIL-B's +Z axis. During extended mission, they are       reversed. In addition, the antennae on each spacecraft are       rotated 45 degrees around their boresight, so that in the flight       configuration they form mirror images of each other. This allows       orthogonal polarizations to separate the transmit and receive       channels in the antenna.         For more specific information, see       lib_10_grail_coord_trans_rev1.pdf in the document directory.         Instrument Overview - DSN     =========================       Three Deep Space Communications Complexes (DSCCs) (near Barstow,       CA; Canberra, Australia; and Madrid, Spain) comprise the DSN       tracking network.  Each complex is equipped with several       antennas [including at least one each 70-m, 34-m High Efficiency       (HEF), and 34-m Beam WaveGuide (BWG)], associated electronics,       and operational systems.  Primary activity at each complex is       radiation of commands to and reception of telemetry data from       active spacecraft.  Transmission and reception is possible in       several radio-frequency bands, the most common being S-band       (nominally a frequency of 2100-2300 MHz or a wavelength of       14.2-13.0 cm) and X-band (7100-8500 MHz or 4.2-3.5 cm).       Transmitter output powers of up to 400 kW are available.         Ground stations have the ability to transmit coded and uncoded       waveforms which can be echoed by distant spacecraft.  Analysis       of the received coding allows navigators to determine the       distance to the spacecraft; analysis of Doppler shift on the       carrier signal allows estimation of the line-of-sight spacecraft       velocity.  Range and Doppler measurements are used to calculate       the spacecraft trajectory and to infer gravity fields of objects       near the spacecraft.         Ground stations can record spacecraft signals that have       propagated through or been scattered from target media.       Measurements of signal parameters after wave interactions with       surfaces, atmospheres, rings, and plasmas are used to infer       physical and electrical properties of the target.         Principal investigators vary from experiment to experiment. See       the corresponding section of the spacecraft instrument       description or the data set description for specifics.         The Deep Space Network is managed by the Jet Propulsion       Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology for the       U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

For design specifications on DSN subsystems       see [DSN810-5].         Subsystems - DSN     ================       The Deep Space Communications Complexes (DSCCs) are an integral       part of Radio Science instrumentation, along with the spacecraft       Radio Frequency Subsystem.  Their system performance directly       determines the degree of success of Radio Science       investigations, and their system calibration determines the       degree of accuracy in the results of the experiments.  The       following paragraphs describe the functions performed by the       individual subsystems of a DSCC.  This material has been       adapted from [ASMARETAL1995] and [JPLD-14027]; for additional       information, consult [DSN810-5].         Each DSCC includes a set of antennas, a Signal Processing       Center (SPC), and communication links to the Jet Propulsion       Laboratory (JPL).  The general configuration is illustrated       below; antennas (Deep Space Stations, or DSS -- a term carried       over from earlier times when antennas were individually       instrumented) are listed in the table.             --------   --------   --------   --------   --------          | DSS 25 | | DSS 27 | | DSS 14 | | DSS 15 | | DSS 16 |          |34-m BWG| |34-m HSB| |  70-m  | |34-m HEF| |  26-m  |           --------   --------   --------   --------   --------               |            |     |             |          |               |            v     v             |          v               |           ---------            |     ---------                --------->|GOLDSTONE|<----------     |EARTH/ORB|                          | SPC  10 |<-------------->|   LINK  |                           ---------                  ---------                          |   SPC   |<-------------->|   26-M  |                          |  COMM   |         ------>|   COMM  |                           ---------         |        ---------                               |             |            |                               v             |            v              ------       ---------         |        ---------             | NOCC |<--->|   JPL   |<-------        |         |              ------      | CENTRAL |                |   GSFC  |              ------      |   COMM  |                | NASCOMM |             | MCCC |<--->| TERMINAL|<-------------->|         |              ------       ---------                  ---------                                                       ^     ^                                                       |     |                    CANBERRA (SPC 40) <----------------      |                                                             |                      MADRID (SPC 60) <----------------------                             GOLDSTONE     CANBERRA      MADRID              Antenna        SPC 10       SPC 40       SPC 60             --------      ---------     --------     --------             26-m            DSS 16       DSS 46       DSS 66             34-m HEF        DSS 15       DSS 45       DSS 65             34-m BWG        DSS 24       DSS 34       DSS 54                             DSS 25                             DSS 26             34-m HSB        DSS 27                             DSS 28             70-m            DSS 14       DSS 43       DSS 63             Developmental   DSS 13           Subsystem interconnections at each DSCC are shown in the diagram       below, and they are described in the sections that follow.

The DMC is the center of activity at a DSCC.  The         DMC receives and archives most of the information from the         NOCC needed by the various DSCC subsystems during their         operation.  Control of most of the DSCC subsystems, as well         as the handling and displaying of any responses to control         directives and configuration and status information received         from each of the subsystems, is done through the DMC.  The         effect of this is to centralize the control, display, and         archiving functions necessary to operate a DSCC. Communication         among the various subsystems is done using a Local Area         Network (LAN) hooked up to each subsystem via a network         interface unit (NIU).           DSCC Antenna Mechanical Subsystem       ---------------------------------         Multi-mission Radio Science activities require support from         the 70-m, 34-m HEF, and 34-m BWG antenna subnets.  The         antennas at each DSCC function as large-aperture collectors         which, by double reflection, cause the incoming radio         frequency (RF) energy to enter the feed horns.  The large         collecting surface of the antenna focuses the incoming energy         onto a subreflector, which is adjustable in both axial and         angular position.  These adjustments are made to correct for         gravitational deformation of the antenna as it moves between         zenith and the horizon; the deformation can be as large as         5 cm.  The subreflector adjustments optimize the channeling         of energy from the primary reflector to the subreflector         and then to the feed horns.  The 70-m and 34-m HEF antennas         have 'shaped' primary and secondary reflectors, with forms         that are modified paraboloids.  This customization allows         more uniform illumination of one reflector by another.  The         BWG reflector shape is ellipsoidal.           On the 70-m antennas, the subreflector directs received energy         from the antenna onto a dichroic plate, a device which         reflects S-band energy to the S-band feed horn and passes         X-band energy through to the X-band feed horn.  In the 34-m         HEF, there is one 'common aperture feed,' which accepts both         frequencies without requiring a dichroic plate. In the 34-m         BWG, a series of small mirrors (approximately 2.5 meters in         diameter) directs microwave energy from the subreflector         region to a collection area at the base of the antenna --         typically in a pedestal room.  A retractable dichroic         reflector separates S- and X-band on some BWG antennas or X-         and Ka-band on others.  RF energy to be transmitted into space         by the horns is focused by the reflectors into narrow         cylindrical beams, pointed with high precision (either to the         dichroic plate or directly to the subreflector) by a series of         drive motors and gear trains that can rotate the movable         components and their support structures.           The different antennas can be pointed by several means.  Two         pointing modes commonly used during tracking passes are         CONSCAN and 'blind pointing.' With CONSCAN enabled and a         closed loop receiver locked to a spacecraft signal, the         system tracks the radio source by conically scanning around         its position in the sky.  Pointing angle adjustments are         computed from signal strength information (feedback) supplied         by the receiver.  In this mode the Antenna Pointing Assembly         (APA) generates a circular scan pattern which is sent to the         Antenna Control System (ACS).  The ACS adds the scan pattern         to the corrected pointing angle predicts.  Software in the         receiver-exciter controller computes the received signal         level and sends it to the APA.  The correlation of scan         position with the received signal level variations allows the         APA to compute offset changes which are sent to the ACS.         Thus, within the capability of the closed-loop control         system, the scan center is pointed precisely at the apparent         direction of the spacecraft signal source.  An additional         function of the APA is to provide antenna position angles and         residuals, antenna control mode/status informatio",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:grs.mess,Gamma Ray Spectrometer for MESSENGER,Gamma Ray Spectrometer,"The Gamma Ray Spectrometer (GRS) instrument formed part of the geochemistry investigation of the MESSENGER mission and yielded information about the elemental composition of the planet's surface. GRS detected gamma-ray emissions in the 0.1 - 10 MeV range, allowing the identification of certain elements and their abundances to be determined. Gamma ray measurements were used to infer the composition of Mercury's surface over localized regions using established techniques, such as used recently on the Lunar Prospector and Mars Odyssey missions. The GRS detector was a coaxial germanium crystal 50 mm in diameter and 50 mm in length, chosen for its superior energy resolution and the ability to anneal the detector to remove accumulated radiation damage. The detector was rigidly clamped in a hermetically sealed Al capsule pressurized with clean, dry nitrogen. The capsule was cooled to an operating temperature in the 80-95 K range by a mechanical cryocooler. A plastic scintillator anti-coincidence shield surrounded the germanium detector in its sides and back, for rejection of cosmic-ray background. Galactic cosmic rays continuously bombard the surface of Mercury, and through interactions with the surface, gamma rays of discrete energies that are characteristic of specific elements are created. A fraction of these gamma rays, as well as those from the decay of radiogenic elements escape from the surface, where they can be detected by the orbiting GRS. Gamma-ray fluxes are measurable at altitudes up to 1000 km and for gamma rays up to about 10 MeV that emanate from depths of up to tens of centimeter beneath the surface. Detected fluxes are generally low and require numerous orbital passes over a specific region to obtain a statistically well-defined energy spectrum. The measurements of elements such as Fe, Si, Mg, Na, Al, Ca, Ti, K and Th by GRS provided insight into distinguishing between different formation models for Mercury as well as other planetary evolution issues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MRO, successfully launched in August 2005, arrived at Mars in March 2006.  Following orbit insertion the spacecraft went into an aerobraking period to achieve a 250 x 315 kilometer near-polar orbit suitable for the Primary Science Phase (PSP) mapping that started in November 2006.  Since the start of PSP HiRISE has been continuously operating acquiring 5-20 observations per day. The HiRISE camera is a pushbroom imaging system featuring a 0.5 m aperture telescope with a 12 m focal effective length and 14 CCD detectors capable of generating images of up to 20,000 cross-scan observation pixels (exclusive of overlap pixels) and 65,000 unbinned scan lines. The HiRISE instrument capabilities include the acquisition of: (1) observations of the Mars surface from orbit with a ground sampling dimension between 25 and 32 cm/pixel, depending on the orbital altitude, along with an intrinsic point spread function of 1.4 pixels (full width at half maximum assuming no spacecraft jitter) and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), (2) high-resolution topographic data from stereo observations with a vertical precision of ~0.2 m over areas of ~5x5 pixels (~1.5 m), and (3) observations in 3 colors with high radiometric fidelity. A key instrument design feature includes Charge Couple Device (CCD) detectors with up to 128 lines of Time Delay and Integration (TDI) to create high (>100:1) SNR in the Red filter bandpass anywhere on Mars.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:hst.hstacs,ADVANCE CAMERA FOR SURVEYS for HST,ADVANCE CAMERA FOR SURVEYS,"       Instrument Overview   ===================       The information in this document is taken from Gonzaga et al.     (2005).  The Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS), a     third-generation instrument, was installed in the Hubble Space     Telescope on March 7, 2002.  Its primary purpose is to increase     HST imaging discovery efficiency by about a factor of 10, with a     combination of detector area and quantum efficiency that     surpasses previous instruments.  In addition, coronagraphic,     polarimetric, and grism capabilities make this a versatile and     powerful instrument.       ACS is a versatile instrument that can be applied to a broad     range of scientific programs. The three prime capabilities of ACS     are:       - Deep, wide-field imaging from visible to near-IR wavelengths.       - High spatial resolution imaging from near-UV to near-IR         wavelengths.       - Solar blind UV imaging.       ACS has three independent cameras that provide wide-field, high     resolution, and ultraviolet imaging capabilities espectively,     using a broad assortment of filters designed to address a large     range of scientific goals.  The three channels are each optimized     for a specific goal:       - Wide Field Channel (WFC): 202 x 202 arcsecond field of view         from 3500 A to 11,000 A, and peak efficiency of 48%         (including the Optical Telescope Assembly (OTA)).  The plate         scale of ~0.05 arcseconds/pixel provides critical sampling at         11,600 A.       - High Resolution Channel (HRC): 29 x 26 arcsecond field of         view from 1700 A to 11,000 A, and peak efficiency of 29%.         The plate scale of ~0.027 arcseconds/pixel provides critical         sampling at 6300 A.       - Solar Blind Channel (SBC): 35 x 31 arcsecond field of view         from 1150 A to 1700 A, plate scale of ~0.032         arcseconds/pixel, and peak efficiency of 7.5%.

The 15 x 15 um pixels provide ~0.05        arcseconds/pixel spatial resolution, with critical sampling at        11,600 A, resulting in a nominal 202 x 202 arcsecond field of        view (FOV).  The spectral sensitivity of the WFC ranges from        3500 A to 11,000 A, with a peak efficiency of 48% at ~7000 A        (including OTA).        - The HRC detector is a 1024 x 1024 SITe CCD, with 21 x 21        micron pixels that provide ~0.028 x 0.025 arcsecond/pixel        spatial resolution with critical sampling at 6300 A.  This        gives the HRC a nominal 29 x 26 arcsecond field of view.  The        spectral response of the HRC ranges from ~1700 A to 11,000 A,        and it has a peak efficiency of 29% at ~6500 A (including OTA).        - The SBC detector is a solar-blind CsI microchannel plate (MCP)        with Multi-Anode Microchannel Array (MAMA) readout.  It has        1024 x 1024 pixels, each 25 x 25 micron in size. This provides        a spatial resolution of ~0.034 x 0.030 arcseconds/pixels,        producing a nominal FOV of 35 x 31 arcseconds.  The SBC UV        spectral response ranges from 1150 A to 1700 A with a peak        efficiency of 7.5% at 1250 A.     Filters   =======       ACS has three filter wheels: two shared by the WFC and HRC, and a     separate wheel dedicated to the SBC.  The WFC/HRC filter wheels     contain the major filter sets.  Each wheel also contains one clear     WFC aperture and one clear HRC aperture (see Chapter 5 of Gonzaga     et al. 2005 for more on filters).  Parallel WFC and HRC     observations are possible for some filter combinations, unless     the user disables this option, or if adding the parallel     observations cannot be done due to timing considerations.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:hst.wfpc2,WIDE FIELD PLANETARY CAMERA 2 for HST,WIDE FIELD PLANETARY CAMERA 2,"       Instrument Overview   ===================     The information in this document is taken from [BURROWS1994].       The original Wide Field and Planetary Camera (WF/PC-1) was a two-     dimensional spectrophotometer with rudimentary polarimetric and     transmission-grating capabilities. WF/PC-1 was launched aboard the     HST in April 1990 and was central to the discovery and     characterization of the spherical aberration in HST. It was     replaced in December 1993 by a second Wide Field and Planetary     Camera (WFPC2) which is described in detail in this document.  The     original Wide Field and Planetary Camera (WF/PC-1) imaged the     center of the field of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST).  The     instrument was designed to operate from 1150 A to 11000 A with a     resolution of 0.1 arcseconds per pixel (Wide Field camera, F/12.9)     or 0.043 arcseconds per pixel (Planetary Camera, F/30), each     camera mode using an array of four 800 x 800 CCD detectors.  The     development and construction of the WF/PC-1 was led by Prof. J. A.     Westphal, Principal Investigator (PI), of the California Institute     of Technology.  The Investigation Definition Team (IDT) also     included J.E. Gunn (deputy PI), W.A. Baum, A.D. Code, D.G. Currie,     G.E. Danielson, T.F. Kelsall, J.A. Kristian, C.R. Lynds, P.K.     Seidelmann, and B.A. Smith. The instrument was built at the Jet     Propulsion Laboratory, Caltech (JPL).       NASA decided to build a second Wide Field and Planetary Camera     (WFPC2) at JPL as a backup clone of the WF/PC-1 because of its     important role in the overall HST mission.  This second version of     the WF/PC was in the early stages of construction at JPL at the     time of HST launch.  A modification of the internal WF/PC optics     could correct for the spherical aberration and restore most of the     originally expected performance.  As a result, it was decided to     incorporate the correction within WFPC2 and to accelerate its     development. The original Wide Field/Planetary Camera (WF/PC1) was     replaced by WFPC2 on the STS-61 shuttle mission in December 1993.

Trauger of     JPL.  The IDT members are C.J. Burrows, J. Clarke, D. Crisp,     J. Gallagher, R.E. Griffiths, J.J. Hester, J. Hoessel, J.     Holtzman, J. Mould, and J.A. Westphal.       Scientific Objectives   =====================     The scientific objectives of the WFPC2 are to provide     photometrically and geometrically accurate, multi-band images     of astronomical objects over a relatively wide field-of-view     (FOV), with high angular resolution across a broad range of     wavelengths.  WFPC2 meets or exceeds the photometric     performance of WF/PC-1 in most areas.  Nominally, the     requirement is 1% photometric accuracy in all filters, which is     essentially a requirement that the relative response in all     800x800 pixels per CCD be known to a precision of 1% in     flat-field images taken through each of the 48 science filters.     Success in this area is dependent on the stability of all     elements in the optical train particularly the CCDs, filters     and calibration channel.  The recovery of the point spread     function is essential to all science programs being conducted     with the WFPC2, because it allows one to both go deeper than     ground based imagery and to resolve smaller scale structure     with higher reliability and dynamic range.       Calibration   ===========     Standard calibration observations are obtained and maintained     in the HST archive at the STScI, and can be obtained by     external users using StarView.  This includes those flat field,     dark and bias frames needed to operate the Post Observation     Data Processing System (PODPS; usually just called the     'pipeline'), a photometric calibration derived from standard     star observations and the measured filter profiles, and derived     determinations of the plate scale, distortion, and so on.  The     first set of these calibrations were provided to the STScI by     the WFPC2 IDT from the Servicing Mission Observatory     Verification (SMOV) and System Level Thermal Vacuum (SLTV)     testing periods, and will be maintained and updated thereafter     by the STScI with initial assistance from the IDT as part of     the long term calibration program.       Operational Considerations   ==========================     The WFPC2 field of view is divided and distributed into four     cameras by a fixed four-faceted pyramid mirror near the HST     focal plane.  Three of these are F/12.9 Wide Field cameras     (WFC), and the remaining one is an F/28.3 Planetary camera     (PC).  There are thus four sets of relay optics and CCD sensors     in WFPC2, rather than the eight in WF/PC-1, which had two     independent field formats.  The pyramid rotation mechanism has     been eliminated, and all four cameras are now in the locations     that were occupied in WF/PC-1 by the wide field camera relays.     These positions are denoted PC1, WF2, WF3, and WF4.       Detectors   =========     The WFPC2 CCDs are thick, front-side illuminated devices made     by Loral.  They support multi-pinned phase (MPP) operation     which eliminates quantum efficiency hysteresis.  They have a     Lumogen phosphor coating to give UV sensitivity.  WF/PC-1 CCDs     were thinned, backside illuminated devices with a coronene     phosphor.  The resulting differences may be summarized as     follows:       Read noise: WFPC2 CCDs have lower read noise (about 5e- rms)                 than WF/PC-1 CCDs (13 e- rms) which improves their                 faint object and UV imaging capabilities.       Dark noise: Inverted phase operation yields lower dark noise for                 WFPC2 CCDs. They are presently being operated at                 -77C and yet the median dark current is about 0.016                 electrons/pixel/sec. This is 10C warmer than the                 WF/PC-1 devices and helps in reducing the build-up                 of contaminants on the CCD windows. If they end up                 being operated colder the dark current reduces by a                 factor of 3 for every 10C temperature drop.       Flat field: WFPC2 CCDs have a more uniform pixel to pixel                 response (<2% pixel to pixel non-uniformity) which                 will improve the photometric calibration.        Pre-Flash: Charge traps are present at the current operating                 temperature. However, by cooling the devices                 further, it is expected that they will become                 negligible for WFPC2 CCDs. Pre-flash exposures will                 then not be required. This would avoid the increase                 in background noise, and decrease in operational                 efficiency that results from a preflash.      Gain switch: Two CCD gains are available with WFPC2, a 7e-/DN                 channel which saturates at about 27000e- (4096 DN                 with a bias of about 300 DN) and a 14e-/DN channel                 which saturates at about 53000e-. The Loral devices                 have a large full well capacity (of 80-100,000                 electrons) and are linear up to the saturation level                 in both channels.              DQE: The Loral devices have intrinsically lower QE above                 4800A (and up to about 6500A) than thinned, backside                 illuminated wafers which have no attenuation by                 frontside electrode structures. On the other hand,                 the improved phosphorescent coating leads to higher                 DQE below 4800A. The peak DQE in the optical is 40%                 at 7000A while in the UV (1100-4000A) the DQE is                 10-15%.      Image Purge: The residual image resulting from a 100x (or more)                 full-well over-exposure is well below the read noise                 within 30 minutes, removing the need for CCD image                 purging after observations of particularly bright                 objects. The Loral devices bleed almost exclusively                 along the columns.     Quantization: The systematic Analog to Digital converter errors                 that were present in the low order bits on WF/PC-1                 have been largely eliminated, contributing to a                 lower effective read noise.              QEH: Quantum Efficiency Hysteresis (QEH) is not a                 significant problem in the Loral CCDs because they                 are frontside illuminated and use MPP operation. The                 absence of any significant QEH means that the                 devices do not need to be UV-flooded and so the                 chips can be warmed for decontamination purposes                 without needing to maintain the UV-flood.     Detector MTF: The Loral devices do suffer from low detector MTF                 perhaps caused by scattering in the frontside                 electrode structure. The effect is to blur images                 and decrease the limiting magnitude by about 0.5                 magnitudes.       Electronics   ===========     The CCD camera electronics system is essentially the same     design as that flown on WF/PC-1 with the exception of changes     made to implement the different clock pattern for MPP inverted     phase operation.  Changes in circuit timing have also been made     to correct the problem of ADC conversion errors.       Filters   =======     A set of 48 filters are included in WFPC2, with the following     features:         1. It approximately replicates the WF/PC-1 'UBVRI' photometry          series.       2. The broad-band filter series is extended into the far UV.       3. There is a new Stromgren series.       4. A Wood's filter is included for far-UV imaging without a red          leak.       5. There is a 1% bandpass linear ramp filter series covering          3700-9800A.       6. The narrow-band series is more uniformly specified and better          calibrated.       The filters are mounted in the Selectable Optical Filter     Assembly (SOFA) between the shutter and the reflecting pyramid.     The SOFA contains 12 filter wheels, each of which has 4 filters     and a clear 'home' position.  Wheel number 1 is located closest     to the shutter.  The categories of simple filters (F) are     long-pass (LP), wide (W), medium (M), and narrow (N).  Most of     these filters are either flat single substrates or sandwiches.       The filter complement includes two solar blind Wood's filters     F160AW and F160BW.  F160BW will be used in all science     observations because the other filter has some large pinholes     that lead to significant red leak.       In addition to the above complement of broad and narrow band     filters WFPC2 features a set of three specialized quadrant     (quad or Q) filters in which each quadrant corresponds to a     facet of the pyramid, and therefore to a distinct camera relay.     There is one quad containing four narrow-band, redshifted [OII]     filters with central wavelengths from 3763-3986A, one quad with     four polarizing elements (POL) with polarization angles, 0, 45,     90 and 135 degrees, and one quad with four methane (CH4) band     filters with central wavelengths from 5433-8929A.  The     polarizer quad filter, can be crossed with any other filter     over the wavelength range from 2800A to 8000A, with the     exception of the Methane Quad and Redshifted [OII] Quad which     share the same wheel.       Optics   ======     The central portion of the OTA F/24 beam is intercepted by a     steerable pick-off mirror attached to the WFPC2 and is diverted     through an open entry port into the instrument.  The entry port     is not sealed with an afocal MgF2 window as it was in WF/PC-1.     The beam then passes through a shutter and filters.  A total of     48 spectral elements and polarizers are contained in an     assembly of 12 filter wheels.  Then the light falls onto a     shallow-angle, four-faceted pyramid located at the aberrated     OTA focus, each face of the pyramid being a concave spherical     surface.  The pyramid divides the OTA image of the sky into     four parts.  After leaving the pyramid, each quarter of the     full field-of-view is relayed by an optical flat to a     cassegrain relay that forms a second field image on a     charge-coupled device (CCD) of 800x800 pixels.  Each detector     is housed in a cell that is sealed by a MgF2 window.  This     window is figured to serve as a field flattener.       The aberrated HST wavefront is corrected by introducing an     equal but opposite error in each of the four cassegrain relays.     An image of the HST primary mirror is formed on the secondary     mirrors in the cassegrain relays.  The previously flat fold     mirror in the PC channel has a small curvature to ensure this,     and this is why the magnification is changed from F/30 to     F/28.3 in the PC.  The spherical aberration from the     telescope's primary mirror is corrected on these secondary     mirrors, which are extremely aspheric.  The point spread     function is then close to that originally expected for WF/PC-1.       Operational Modes   =================     The CCDs and their associated signal chains have read-out noise     levels (in the absence of signal shot noise or interference) of     approximately 5 e-.  The WF/PC-1 CCD read noise was effectively     15-20 e-, since there were additional contributions above the     nominal 13 e- resulting from 'missing codes' in the ADC and the     preflash exposure.       The conversion factors from detected electrons (QE * number of     incident photons) to data numbers (DN) are tabulated below, as     are read noise and linearity.  Note that all calculations of     sensitivity in this manual assume gains of 7 and 14 for two     gain channels, choices very close to the measured gains.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:ice.epas,ENERGETIC PARTICLE ANISOTROPY SPECTROMETER for ICE,ENERGETIC PARTICLE ANISOTROPY SPECTROMETER,"       Instrument Host Overview     ========================       Energetic protons and heavy nucleons are detected       by three identical charged- particle telescopes       aligned at different angles (30deg, 60deg and       135deg) to the spin axis which is perpendicular to       the ecliptic plane..  Each telescope consists of a       1 cm**2 solid-state detector of 30 micron thickness       immediately followed by a 2 cm**2 detector of 150       micron thickness in anticoincidence.  Pulse-height       analysis resolves the particle total kinetic       energies into eight channels between 35 keV and 1.6       MeV for protons.  (These ranges are slightly       mass-dependent for heavy ions because of detector       dead-layer effects.) The count rate from each       telescope and each channel is resolved into eight       sectors in the equatorial plane to measure the       anisotropy of the particles.  A mechanical       collimator defines a 16 degree half-width viewing       cone and a geometrical factor of 0.05 cm2 sr for       each telescope.  A magnetic broom prevents < 400       keV electrons from entering the telescope while       higher energy electrons trigger the second detector       and so are not counted.  To sample the three       telescopes, eight energies and eight sectors       requires 32 s at 1024 bit/s.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:ice.ici,ION COMPOSITION INSTRUMENT for ICE,ION COMPOSITION INSTRUMENT,"   Instrument Overview ===================  The Ion Composition Instrument is a novel spectrometer for measuring  the ionic composition of the solar wind from the ICE (ISEE-C, ISEE3)  spacecraft.  The resolution and dynamic range of the instrument are  sufficient to be able to resolve up to twelve individual ions or groups  of ions.  This will permit the solution of a number of fundamental  problems related to solar abundances and the formation of the solar  wind.  The spectrometer is composed of a stigmatic Wien filter and  hemispherical electrostatic energy analyzer.  The use of curved  electric field plates in the filter results in a substantial saving of  weight with respect to a conventional filter of the same resolution and  angular acceptance.    The spectrometer is controlled by a microprocessor based on a special  purpose computer which has three modes of operations: full and partial  survey modes and a search mode.  In the search mode, the instrument  locks on to the solar wind.  This allows four times the time resolution  of the full survey mode and yields a full mass spectrum every 12.6 min.   SCIENTIFIC OVERVIEW ===================    ION COMPOSITION studies in the solar wind are essential for  understanding the dynamics and energetics of the solar wind  acceleration region, and are an important source of solar abundance  information.  The ion composition of the solar wind is, however, poorly  known because of the technical difficulties associated with the  separation of the different ions over the wide dynamic range involved.    With electrostatic energy analyzers, the He+2 /H+ abundance ratio has  been studied extensively in the solar wind, and large variations found.  During quiet low-temperature conditions, ions other than H+ and 4He+2  have been separated with this technique and the presence of heavy ions  has been demonstrated.  In addition, some information about abundances  and charge state distributions has been obtained.    The foil collection technique has been used to determine the abundances  of the isotopes of He, Ne, and Ar in the solar wind. Although this  method has yielded precise abundance data, its time resolution is  limited.    The ICE spacecraft will be continuously in the solar wind and thus  affords an opportunity for a comprehensive uninterrupted composition  study.  With a continuous record of such a large number of ions,  fundamental problems concerning the origin of the solar wind and solar  composition can be investigated. Some of these are discussed below.    1) A number of momentum transfer mechanisms for the acceleration of  heavy ions into the solar wind have been proposed.  Under the inferred  conditions in the solar wind source region, coulomb collisions would be  sufficient to transfer momentum from protons to heavy ions with high  Z**2/M ratios.  Momentum transfer by waves has also been proposed as an  efficient mechanism.    To assess the relative importance of the various mechanisms,  measurements of solar wind ions over a large range of M and Z under  varying conditions in the corona and solar wind are necessary.    2) Bame et al. (1978) have recently proposed that the He/H ratio of  0.04-0.05 typically found in fast solar wind streamers be equated with  the He/H ratio in the outer convective zone of the sun.  This is a  factor of two lower than the generally accepted value and, if  correct, would reduce the calculated boron neutrino flux.  A  comprehensive investigation of the ion abundance variations should lead  to a better understanding of ion fractionation processes in the solar  corona, and in turn should yield accurate estimates of the He/H ratio.    3) A correlation between the He/H ratio and solar wind speed has been  observed but the mechanism is unknown. By extending correlation studies  to other ions it may be possible to uncover the mechanism.    4) Local temperatures and temperature gradients in the corona can be  estimated from measurement of the charge distribution of Fe ions and  the charge states of 0 and Si. To test the validity of the various  solar wind expansion models, the experimentally derived temperatures  and gradients can be compared to those derived from the models.    5) An average 4He/3He ratio of 2350 +- 120 has been derived from the  five Apollo solar wind foil experiments , however, the ratio appears to  be highly variable.  In one instance, a ratio of 500 was observed over  a two-day period With the mass spectrometer on ICE (ISEE-C), 3He will  be continuously monitored, permitting an accurate determination of the  solar surface abundance of this cosmologically important nucleus. The  relation between anomalous 3He abundances in the solar wind and the  small 4 He/3He ratios in some solar flares can also be studied.     Calibration ===========  The sensor was calibrated at the test facility of the Physikalisches  Institut of the University of Bern.  This facility consists of a  vacuum chamber in which a homogeneous monoenergetic mass separated  beam of ions can be produced and directed at the sensor mounted on a  test platform which can be rotated about two axes perpendicular to the  direction of the ion beam.  Sweep circuits were used to synchronously  change the voltages on the plates of the filter and analyzer while the  outputs of each of the three CEM's strobed a multi-channel analyzer  operating in the pulse-height-analysis mode. Calibrations were  performed with H2+ and He+ at nominal velocities of 300, 400, 500, and  600 km/s.  The orientation of the sensor with respect to the incident  ion beam was changed in small increments over a range of +- 8 degree in  the horizontal plane and +- 14 degree in the vertical plane.  Angular  acceptances derived from these functions are in good agreement with  theory, whereas the experimental resolution always exceeds that  predicted. The absolute values of the transmission determined at normal  incidence for H2+ and 4He+ at the four different values of ion velocity  are in excellent agreement with theory.  The ability of the instrument  to reject stray ions which create ghost peaks by scattering from the  outside plates of the analyzer and contribute to the background was  measured.  In all cases, the ratio of ghost peak counts to counts in  the main peak was less than 10**-4  with the ghost peaks always  appearing at energy values 7 percent less than those of the  corresponding main peaks. Because of the large difference in M/Z  between 4He and 3He, interference of 4He+2 at the position of the 3He+2  peak is less than 10**-5 of the 4He signal.     Operational Considerations ==========================  The input voltages to the power supplies which provide the potential to  the electric field plates of the Wien filter and energy analyzer are  obtained from 12-bit digital-to-analog converters.  The digital  inputs to the converters come from the microcomputer-based processor.  The full parameter range covered by the experiment is 300-600 km/s in  velocity, 840- 11720 eV/Z in energy per charge, and 1.5-5.6 in mass per  charge.  The velocity range is divided into n steps and the energy  per charge range into m steps, with both being logarithmically  related.        V(1s), (n, m) = R1**(m-1)*R2**(n-1)*V1(1,1),    energy analyzer           V(2s),(n) = R2** (n -1)*V2 (1),  Wien filter    1 < n < 24, 1 <m <-40 (15)    where V1s, and V2s, are the digital values of the voltages applied to  the inputs of the power supplies, V1(1, 1) and V2(1) are the voltages  for the velocity step n = 1 and the mass step m = 1, and R1 and R2 are  constants.    There are three modes of operation which are selectable by ground  command.  In mode 1, m is varied from 1 to 40.  For each value of m, n  is varied over its complete range.  This mode is useful for surveying  the solar wind.  In mode 2, minimum and maximum values of m and n are  chosen, so that only a part of the fuli parameter range is scanned;  this mode will be for particular MIZ ratio determinations.  Mode 3 is a  search mode.  The value of n corresponding to the velocity of the solar  wind is determined by varying n from I to 24 while holding m constant  at the value corresponding to that for 4 He until the value of n  corresponding to the maximum counting rate is found.  A scan is then  made from n = n (solar wind) - 3 to n = n (solar wind) + 3 varying m  between specified minimum and maximum values.  This mode is intended  for normal operations, as it yields the most data per unit time.  In  general, after each spin of the spacecraft a step is taken, but  provisions have been made for holding a step for s = 2, 4, or 8  rotations of the spacecraft.    The telemetry contains details of the mode, specified by the values of  VI(l, 1), V2(l), mmin, mmax, nmin, nmax, s, R1, R2, and the counts from  each of the detectors (separately logarithmically compressed above  127) for the corresponding values of m and n. At the minimum time  resolution, a spectrum is obtained every 24 X 40 X 3 s (spin period = 3  s), or 48 min. Use of the search mode reduces this to approximately 12  X 3 + 6 X 40 X 3 s = 12 min, 36 s.     Detectors =========  The basic requirements of the instrument were that it be capable of  measuring ionic abundances over the M/Z range of 1.5-5.6 (3He+2 -  56Fe+10) at velocities from 300 to 600 km/s. To keep the dynamic range  near 1x10**4 , H+ is not measured. The geometric factor g of the  instrument is related to the ion flux F and count rate N by               g = N/F                                       (1)  In order that N be at least one count per second for the least abundant  ion species under consideration, g must be of order 10**-3 cm2. The  dimensions of the apertures and angular acceptances in the plane of  the spacecraft rotation and perpendicular to it determine g. The  combination of a Wien filter and an electrostatic energy analyzer is a  well-known means for determining the velocity and the energy per charge  and, hence, the mass per charge of ions.  Low resolution mass  spectrometers of this type have been flown in the solar wind  and in  the inner magnetosphere.    The spherical electrostatic energy analyzer is of conventional design.  Care was taken to insure that the height and spacing of the plates were  sufficient to accommodate the maximum angular divergence of entering  ions; the analyzer constant is 5.86 eV/V, and its energy resolution is  50.  With this design, the energy analyzer will transmit virtually all  ions at the tuned energy independent of the angle with which they leave  the Wien filter and enter the analyzer.  It was thus assumed that the  transmission function for the tuned analyzer is unity.     Filters =======  It has been shown that the Wien filter can be made to focus along the  direction of the magnetic field as well; as perpendicular to it by  using cylindrical electrical plates. When this is done, the focusing  length will be longer than for the parallel plate filter by a factor of  2**-1/2 however, the height of the filter can be reduced by up to a  factor of 2. The result is a filter with volume and approximate  weight 2**-1/2 that of a conventional filter of comparable resolution  and geometric factor.  Three important parameters are 1) Ion Optics; 2)  Transmission Properties; 3) Velocity Resolution; and 4) Angular  Acceptance.     Measured Parameters ===================    The table below details a description of the Wien filter and energy  analyzer parameters.  An approximation to the geometric factor is       g = s * h * T * (delta alpha) (1/2)/180        (14)    where s and h are the width and height of the Wien filter entrance  aperture, (delta alpha) (1/2) is the acceptance angle in the x-z plane,  and T is the transmission.  Using the data from Coplan et al. (1978)  Table II at a speed of 450 km/s, g is typically 1.7 x 10**-3 CM**2 for  3He and 4x 10**-4 CM**2  for the Fe ions, results which are close to  the design goal.  To achieve the theoretical resolution, the magnetic  field in the working gap of the Wien filter was made homogeneous to  better than +-l percent by the use of shaped pole pieces.  The magnets  used are sintered samarium cobalt, and a contoured yoke of vanadium  pennendur provides a flux path for the internal magnetic field and  serves as the principal structural element of the filter.  To reduce  the joint area (which contributes to flux leakage), the yoke was fabri-  cated with only one open end.  A shield of high permeability material  further attenuates the external magnetic field to acceptable levels.  The electric field in the Wien filter is produced by plates of gold  plated aluminum with shims on top and bottom of each to correct for  fringing fields.  The plates of the electrostatic analyzer were  roughened and plated with copper sulfide black in order to reduce ion  scattering and UV reflectivity.  A grounded high-transmission grid  covers the exit aperture to reduce field distortion inside the  analyzer.    Ions leaving the exit aperture of the analyzer are detected by  three identical channeltron electron multipliers (CEM's)  mounted on ceramic circuit boards which also contain pre-  amplifiers and discriminators.  The multipliers are operated in  the saturated pulse mode and the discriminators are set at a  level corresponding to approximately 10**-13 C of charge per  pulse.    A grid, maintained at the potential of the CEM input, is placed  directly in front of the detectors to increase counting efficiency by  ensuring that all secondary electrons are collected.  The relative  count rates in each of the detectors depend on the angular  distribution of the ions entering the filter and can be used to obtain  the direction of the bulk motion of each species and some temperature  information.  Counts are only registered during 12 percent of the spin  period of 3 s, giving a total background count rate of 0.02 per spin  period. By comparison, the count rate for each of the Fe charge states  (flux, 3 X 10**3 CM**-2 S**-1  ; geometric factor, 4 X 10**-4 CM**2) i  s estimated to be 4 counts per spin period.

The instrument automatically chooses       one of eight ranges in which to operate, the four       lowest full-scale ranges being +/-4, +/- 14, +/-42,       and +/- 146 nT.  The precision of measurement is       1/256 of the full-scale field values (0.016, 0.055       nT, etc.).

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:ice.uleca,ULTRA LOW ENERGY CHARGE ANALYZER for ICE,ULTRA LOW ENERGY CHARGE ANALYZER,"   Instrument Overview ===================  The ISEE-1 and ISEE-C instruments have been designed to measure the  elemental abundances, charge state composition, energy spectra, and  angular distributions of energetic ions in the energy range 2  keV/charge to 80 MeV/nucleon and of electrons between 75 and 1300 keV.  By covering the energy range between solar wind and low-energy cosmic  rays the instrument will fill a gap in the knowledge especially of the  nuclear and ionic composition of solar, interplanetary, and magneto-  spheric accelerated and trapped particles.  The instrument consists of  three different sensor systems: ULECA is an electrostatic deflection  analyzer system with rectangular solid-state detectors as energy deter-  mining devices, its energy range is -3 to 560 keV/charge; the ULEWAT is  a double dE/dX versus E thin-window flow-through proportional  counter/solid-state detector telescope covering the energy range from  0.2 to 80 MeV/nucleon (Fe); the ULEZEQ sensor consists of a com-  bination of an electrostatic deflection analyzer and a thin-window  dE/dX versus E system with a thin-window proportional counter and a  position-sensitive solid-state detector.  The energy range is 0.4  MeV/nucleon to 6 MeV/nucleon.    While the ULECA and the ULEWAT sensors  are designed mainly for interplanetary and outer magnetospheric  studies, the ULEZEQ sensor will also obtain composition data in the  trapped radiation zone. 65 rates and pulse-height data can be  obtained with sectoring in up to 16 sectors.      Scientific Objectives  =====================  The low-energy portion of interplanetary and magnetospheric particles  (energies 1 keV/nucleon to several hundred keV/nucleon) has been  virtually unexplored to date.  Measure. ments in this region, however,  are expected to provide sensitive probes of solar, interplanetary, and  magnetospheric phenomena.    A. SolarandlnterplanetaryPhenomena    1) Solar Flare Acceleration Mechanism: The mechanism by which ions are  accelerated in flares is not presently known. Important information on  this mechanism, however, is avafl. able from studies of the energy  spectra of the particles which the mechanism produces.  This is  particularly true in the case of heavier ions at low energies.  These  particles are not expected to be fully stripped of their electrons.  Thus in the same energy range different ions cover different rigidity  in ter-vals.  By examining, then, the energy spectra of many ions at  low energies, and also electrons, we will place stringent constraints  on the rigidity dependence of the flare acceleration process.    2) The Location of the Flare Acceleration Region: Low-energy ions also  provide in their charge states infon-nation on the region in the corona  where they are accelerated.  The charge of solar particles is frozen-in  as the particles leave the corona; the plasma density in interplanetary  space is too low to cause additional ionization or recombination.  Thus  the charge composition, particularly of very low energy ions, can  reflect the temperature of coronal electrons in the region where the  particles are accelerated, propagate, or are stored, For example, if  the ions are accelerated in the flare site itself, we should expect a  high degree of ionization, appropriate to the high temperature in the  flare.  In contrast, if the particles are accelerated in the  surrounding corona by, e.g., plasma disturbances emitted from the  flare, we should expect a charge composition more similar to that of  the solar wind.    3) Coronal Propagation and Storage: Low-energy ions also provide some  of the most detailed information on coronal propagation mechanisms, and  coronal storage.  Measurements in the broad rigidity range covered by  partially stripped ions at low energies, and also by low-energy  electrons, will provide stringent tests of the current idea that  coronal propagation is rigidity-independent.  Further, ionization  loss which is a consequence of extended coronal storage is most evident  at low energies, where it should produce in the differential energy  spectra a systematic flattening which depends on the charge squared to  mass ratio.  From the flattening observed in the spectra of different  ions, it should be possible to determine the time during which the  particles are stored and/or the coronal density and thus the location  of the region where the storage occurs.    4) Compositional Variations in Solar Flares: The composition of  energetic flare particles is known to vary widely from flare to flare,  particularly at low energies.  The cause of this variability is not  presently known.  It may result from the fact that heavier ions, which  may not be fully stripped of their electrons, can exhibit different  rigidities in different flares, and thus will respond differently to  the flare acceleration process.  It may be also that the variations  reflect compositional anomalies in the coronal material from which  the particles are accelerated.  Our investigation, which can deter-  mine the charge states of low-energy ions, will probe the former  explanation in detail.  From these charge-state measurements, which  can indicate the coronal conditions where the particles are  accelerated, and from our general ability to observe flares in  considerable detail, we will also provide information on the latter  possibility.    Of particular interest in the study of compositional variations in  solar events are the so-called  3He-rich event, in which the 3He/4He  ratio can exceed unity. These flares are one of the more dramatic  examples of compositional anomalies since the coronal abundance is  3He/4He <  10**-3 . These flares also have the peculiarity that there  is no accompanying increase in deuterium and tritium, which are equal  byproducts of 3He in spallation reactions, and there is a general  enhancement in heavier elements, particularly in iron.  Our  investigation will extend the measurements of 3 He and heavier ions in  these flares to much lower energies than has been possible to date.    5) Interplanetary Propagation: The current theory for energetic  particle interactions with the magnetic field in the solar wind is  inadequate in that it predicts more pitch-angle scattering than is  observed.  These differences are most pronounced, and thus most easily  studied at low energies (< 1 MeV/nucleon). We will make a detailed  study of propagation at low energies by observing the anisotropies of  protons and helium throughout our energy range, as well as the time  profiles of different ion species and electrons.  The former  measurement is a sensitive indicator of the extent of the scattering;  both measurements provide information on its rigidity dependence.    6) Interplanetary Acceleration: It appears from studies in recent years  that the majority of co-rotating particle streams are the result of  interplanetary acceleration, as opposed to of direct solar origin.  The  origin of the particles, however, is not presently known.  It may be  that the particles are accelerated out of the solar wind.  It is  possible also that the particles enter the solar wind as energetic  solar particles and receive here an additional acceleration.  Our  measurements of the spectra, anisotropies, and charge states of ions,  over an essentially continuous energy range from the solar wind to  high-energy particles, should provide stringent tests of these pos-  sible origins.   If these particles are accelerated out of the solar  wind, their charge states should be those of solar wind ions, and their  spectra a continuous extension of the solar wind distribution.  Particles which originate as more energetic solar particles, in  contrast, may be more highly ionized and may exhibit a behavior at  higher energies which is uncorrelated with that closer to solar wind  energies.    7) The Anomalous Cosmic-Ray Component: From 1972 on, a component with  the anomalous composition of only helium, nitrogen, oxygen, and neon  has been observed in the cosmic-ray flux at energies 1-30 MeV/nucleon.  The origin of this component is presently being debated, although there  is mounting evidence that it results from interstellar neutral  particles which are swept into the heliosphere and ionized and  accelerated in the solar wind.  This component appears to be a feature  of solar minimum conditions.  Our observations over the next few years  will record the behavior of this component as solar activity increases  with the onset of the new solar cycle.    8) Correlated Studies with Deep-Space Missions: Our investigation  will also provide measurements at earth for correlated studies of  galactic cosmic-ray modulation and solar flare propagation with deep-  space missions such as Pioneer and Voyager.     Detectors =========  The ULECA (Utra Low Energy Charge Analyzer) sensor incorporates  techniques of electrostatic deflection and a total energy measurement  to provide the charge composition of ions in the energy range 2 to  560 keV/charge.  ULECA is a design of the University of Maryland ECA  (Energy Charge Analyzer) instrument flown on IMP 7 and 8 satellites .  Low-energy ions pass through a multisht focusing collimator and enter  one of three deflection regions designed by L, M, and MP.  Seven  rectangular surface-barrier (Au-Si) solid-state detectors are placed at  fixed positions at the exit of the deflection regions, each defining  a given energy per charge window.  The output of each of these  detectors is pulse-height analyzed provided the solid-state  anticoincidence detectors are not triggered.  A residual background  (due to cosmic-ray produced secondaries) and the geometrical factor of  the collimator determine the minimum flux which can be measured by each  detector (see table below).  The majority of penetrating particles is  eliminated from analysis by the solid-state anticoincidence detectors.

The major effect not included is the secondary electron background in  the solid-state detector.  This effect is caused by the interaction of  high-energy particles in the spacecraft. Our experience with similar  detector systems on IMP's 7 and 8 indicate that this will not be an  important effect for magnetospheric events.    In the L deflection region, a variable power supply steps the  deflection voltage in 32 logarithmic increments from 600 to 1550 V,  stepping once every 5 spin periods (16 s).  The voltage range may be  changed up or down by 50 percent via ground con-unand.  Two low-noise  (1 5-keV energy threshold) rectangular solid-state detectors Ll and L2  measure the energy and record the counting rate of deflected ions for  each voltage step.  The relative energy per charge windows delta E/E  are 0.07 and 0.15 (FWHM), and the energy ranges over which measurements  are made are 1.8 to 9.5 and 5.1 to 30.5 keV/charge for L1 and L2,  respectively.    In the M and MP deflection region, two high-voltage supplies are used  to provide deflection fields of 1.5 and 6.7 kV/cm, respectively.  At  the exit of the M section 3 rectangular solid-state detectors, Ml, M2,  and M3 measure the fluxes and anisotropies of protons, alpha's and Q >  4 ions in the energy range 25 to 140 keV/charge.  These detectors are  also pulse-height-analyzed for more detailed charge spectra. In  the MP section, a single position-sensitive rectangular Si detector is  used to determine the charge spectrum of ions (H to Fe) from 105 to 560  keV/charge.     Measured Parameters ===================  Each detector is monitored by one or more threshold discriminators  whose outputs are passed through a system of coincidence-  anticoincidence logic which generates 65 different counting rates  corresponding to a variety of detector combinations, particle energy  windows, etc.  The number of accumulated counts for any particular rate  is stored in one 24-bit register in a 256 register memory. (There are  two such memories, identical in all respects, for redundancy. For the  most part only one memory is used with the second remaining as a  backup, with data storage able to be switched between the memories by  command.) Individual rates are read out at predetermined intervals and  logarithmically compressed to either 10 or 12 bits and inserted into  the telemetry stream.  Some rates are accumulated continuously over all  directions during the spacecraft spin (omnidirectional rates), others  are sorted into 8 directional angular sectors so as to measure flux  anisotropies (sectored rates).  Of these rates, the BASIC rates are of  special importance.  Their logic requirements are identical to the  ones required to trigger individual pulse-height analyzed (PHA) events.  Absolute fluxes can therefore, be computed from PHA events.  Due to the  large number of rate channels generated, the telemetry of individual  rates involves a rather complicated submultiplexing scheme, which  cannot be described here.

Atmospheric entry occurred at a nominal height of 128 km above the Mars surface at a nominal atmospheric relative velocity of 5400 m/s.  The frictional drag of the atmosphere upon the entry vehicle results in a reduction in the speed of the entry vehicle. This deceleration is measured by the accelerometers within the IMU, while the orientation of the entry vehicle is provided by the gyroscope measurements. The FOGs also provided relative orientation information for both the backshell and the lander after parachute deployment, which occurred approximately 240 seconds after entry at an altitude approximately 8.5 kilometers above the surface.  The lander separated from the backshell and descended on a tether approximately 30 seconds after parachute deployment.  Subsequent simultaneous backshell and lander (rover) IMU measurements in this tethered condition allow for the 'swing' of the lander on the tether to be determined.  This enabled removal of this motion from the accelerometer measurements, permitting a determination of the net motion of the lander toward the surface.  This allows for atmospheric profile reconstruction while the lander is still attached to the parachute.  These measurements (as well as the descent imaging) also served as part of the guidance for the horizontal motion reduction system which was included to minimize lander horizontal motion upon initial impact with the surface. The bridle connecting the lander to the backshell was severed approximately three seconds prior to surface impact.  The backshell IMU measurements ceased upon the severing of this connection.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:inms.co,ION AND NEUTRAL MASS SPECTROMETER for CO,ION AND NEUTRAL MASS SPECTROMETER,"       ABSTRACT   ========       The Cassini Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer (INMS) investigation     will determine the mass composition and number densities of     neutral species and low-energy ions in key regions of the Saturn     system.  The primary focus of the INMS investigation is on the     composition and structure of titan's upper atmosphere and its     interaction with Saturn's magnetospheric plasma. Of particular     interest is the high-altitude region, between 900 and 1000 km,     where the methane and nitrogen photochemistry is initiated that     leads to the creation of complex hydrocarbons and nitriles that     may eventually precipitate onto the moon's surface to form     hydrocarbon-nitrile lakes or oceans.  The investigation is also     focused on the neutral and plasma environments of Saturn's ring     system and icy moons and on the identification of positive ions     and neutral species in Saturn's inner magnetosphere.  Measurement     of material sputtered from the satellites and the rings by     magnetospheric charged particle and micrometeorite bombardment is     expected to provide information about the formation of the giant     neutral cloud of water molecules and water products that surrounds     Saturn out to a distance of ~12 planetary radii and about the     genesis and evolution of the rings.       The text of this instrument description has been abstracted from     the instrument paper [WAITEETAL2004].       Waite, Jr J.H, W. S. Lewis, W. T. Kasprzak, V. G. Anicich,     B. P. Block, T. E. Cravens, G. G. Fletcher, W.-H. Ip,     J. G. Luhmann, R. L. Mcnutt, H. B. Niemann, J. K. Parejko,     R. L. Thorpe, E. M. Walter, R. V. Yelle, The Cassini Ion and     Neutral Mass Spectrometer (INMS) Investigation, Space Sci. Rev.,     in press, 2004.       INSTRUMENT OVERVIEW   ===========================       The INMS instrument [KASPRZAKETAL1996] consists of a closed ion     source and an open ion source; various focusing lenses; an     electrostatic quadrupole switching lens; a radio frequency     quadrupole mass analyzer; two secondary electron multiplier     detectors; and the associated supporting electronics and power     supply systems.       The INMS will be operated in three different modes: a closed     source neutral mode, for the measurement of non-reactive neutrals     such as N2 and CH4; an open source neutral mode, for reactive     neutrals such as atomic nitrogen; and an open source ion mode, for     positive ions with energies less than 100 eV. Instrument     sensitivity is greatest in the first mode, because the ram     pressure of the inflowing gas can be used to enhance the density     of the sampled non-reactive neutrals in the closed source     ante-chamber. In this mode, neutral species with concentrations on     greater than approximately 1.0E04 per cubic centimeter will be     detected (compared with approximately 1.0E05 per cubic centimeter     in the open source neutral mode). For ions the detection threshold     is on the order of 1.0E-02 per cubic centimeter at Titan relative     velocity of (6 kps). The INMS instrument has a mass range of 1 to     99 Daltons and a mass resolution M/(deltaM) of 100 at 10% of the     mass peak height, which will allow detection of heavier     hydrocarbon species and of possible cyclic hydrocarbons such as     C6H6.       SCIENTIFIC OBJECTIVES   =====================       The primary objectives of the Cassini Ion and Neutral Mass     Spectrometer investigation are to study composition and structure     of Titan's upper atmosphere and the neutral and plasma     environments of Saturn's ring system, icy moons and inner     magnetosphere.       -Objectives concerning the upper atmosphere of Titan include:         Determine the thermal structure of Titan's upper atmosphere.         Determine the bulk composition of Titan's upper atmosphere and       the key chemical processes which determine it.         Investigate the interaction between Titan's and Saturn's       magnetosphere and between Titan and the solar wind.         Determine if Titan's ionosphere is magnetized and the source of       the magnetization.         Investigate the interactions at the upper ionosphere boundary.         Determine the relative contributions of various loss processes.         Determine the contribution of neutrals and ions to Saturn's       magnetosphere by Titan       -Objectives concerning Saturn's inner magnetosphere, rings and icy       satellites include:         Determine the composition and density of the ring system neutral       atmosphere and ionosphere.         Investigate the interactions between the icy satellites and the       magnetospheric plasma.       CALIBRATION   ===========       The characterization of the INMS flight unit was performed at     Goddard Space Flight Center using a high-vacuum test station with     both thermal neutral and ion sources.  A neutral beam system was     not available at the time of the INMS testing. Thus the ion beam     was also used to characterize instrument performance in the open     source neutral mode; for these tests, however, the INMS entrance     lens (OL4) potential was set at D5 V, as required for the     neutral beaming mode.  The test station was designed so that all     the INMS operational modes could be characterized without breaking     the vacuum and thus necessitating re-baking the sensor. Neutral     gases and ions used for characterization testing were introduced     into the main vacuum chamber, to which the INMS was attached by a     flexible bellows with two degrees of rotational freedom for angles     up to about 5 degrees.  The instrument could be translated to     allow appropriate positioning of the source being tested (i. e.,     of the open source with respect to the ion beam).  Pressures     inside the main vacuum chamber were kept below ~10^-6 hPa in order     to prevent possible damage to the secondary electron multipliers.     Thus the operation of the instrument at higher pressures, i. e, up     to mid-10^-5 hPa, the estimated ram pressure at Titan closest     approach, was not tested.  Laboratory support electronics were     used for early testing; flight electronics were used for the final     characterization.  Characterization of INMS performance will     continue during the post-launch period with testing of the     engineering unit.       OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS   ===========================       [to be supplied]     DETECTORS   =========       The INMS instrument [KASPRZAKETAL1996] is a modification of the     Neutral Gas and Ion Mass Spectrometer instrument designed for the     Comet Rendezvous Asteroid Flyby Mission.  The Cassini instrument     consists of two separate ion sources for sampling ambient neutrals     and ions, an ion deflector/trap, four hot-filament electron guns,     an electrostatic quadrupole switching lens that selects between     the sources, various focusing lenses, a quadrupole mass analyzer,     and two secondary electron multiplier (SEM) detectors. Instrument     control is provided by the Flight Computer, according to the     values entered in various software tables.       The gas densities at Titan and other INMS targets are nearly     optimal for direct sampling without ambient pressure reduction.     Two separate ion sources -- a closed source and an open     source -- rather than a single combined quasi-open ion source are     used in the INMS instrument in order to optimize interpretation of     the neutral species.  In the closed source mode, the ram pressure     of the inflowing gas creates a density enhancement in the source     antechamber, allowing the sampled species to be measured with     relatively high precision and sensitivity.  This mode will be used     to measure species, such as N2 and CH4, which do not react with     the antechamber surfaces. The open source has the advantage that     it can measure reactive neutral radicals, such as atomic nitrogen,     and ions.  In this mode, the ambient neutral gas density is     sampled directly with no stagnation enhancement and no collisions     with the surfaces of the instrument.  For open source ion     measurements, the INMS angular response can be increased beyond     the geometric view cone (8.6 deg. cone half angle) by adjusting the     voltages on the plates in the ion deflector/trap and the exit     aperture lens (top plate lens).  For neutral sampling in the open     source mode, the ion trap removes incoming ions and electrons,     which could cause spurious ionization of neutral species, and     allows only neutrals to pass into the ionization region.  In both     the closed and open source modes, impacting electrons emitted from     the hot- filament electron guns ionize the sampled neutrals.       Electrostatic lenses are used to focus the ambient ions and those     created from ambient neutrals by electron impact into the     quadrupole switching lens [MAHAFFY&LAI1990], an electrostatic     device that steers ions from either the closed or open source     through a system of focusing lenses into a dual radio frequency     (RF) quadrupole mass analyzer.  The mass analyzer selectively     filters the ions according to their mass-to-charge ratio.  Two     secondary electron multipliers operating in pulse-counting mode     cover the dynamic range required.  The INMS mass range was     increased from its initial value of 1-66 to 1-99 Daltons (atomic     mass units) to allow detection of heavier hydrocarbon species and     possible pre-biotic cyclic hydrocarbons such as C6H6.  Using two     different radio frequencies and scanning the mass to charge ratios     from 1 to 8 and then from 12 to 99 Daltons accomplish this.       The INMS instrument is mounted on the Cassini's Fields and     Particles Pallet (FPP).  The out-ward normal to both the open and     closed source INMS apertures lies in the spacecraft X     direction.  The open source geometric field of view is about 8.6 deg.     cone half angle.  This limits the angular response for neutral and     ions measured in the open source mode, although, as noted above,     the angular response for the measurement of ambient ions can be     improved by adjusting the voltage applied to the open source ion     deflectors.  In contrast, the closed source has a much wider     geometric field of view of approximately 2^1 steradians.  The     open source is vented to lower the ion source and analyzer     pressures (increasing the ion mean free path) during a Titan pass     when the spacecraft ram is approximately along the X     direction.  Venting occurs at right angles to the X axis.       ELECTRONICS   ===========       The INMS electronics system is based on designs used for the     Huygen's Probe GCMS instrument.  A low-voltage (LV) power     supply converts spacecraft power to well-regulated DC voltages     that are supplied to the instrument electronics.  A     pulse-width-modulated converter allows efficient generation of     multiple secondary voltages while providing secondary-to-primary     isolation.  A large number of voltages are required to bias the     various focus electrodes as well as to supply DC voltages for the     secondary electron multipliers.  Analog modules are used for     regulating the emission of the electron guns, for providing fixed     and programmable voltages to set lens potentials, for supplying RF     and DC for the quadrupole mass analyzer, for supplying high     voltages for the detectors, and for the pulse-counting circuits.     The digital electronics includes a single micro-processor, a     spacecraft bus interface circuit, and an interface between the CPU     and the analog modules.  Major portions of the electronics are     packaged in hybrid circuits to save weight and space.       A radio frequency generator drives the quadrupole at two resonant     frequencies in order to reduce the need for large amplitude     potential for the required mass range (1-99 Daltons).  A     solid-state switched bandpass filter performs frequency selection.     The DC voltage is created by high-voltage operational amplifiers     and is superimposed on the RF amplitude.  Digital-to-analog     converters program both the RF and DC amplitudes.       Charge pulses at the anode of the electron multiplier are     converted by a pulse amplifier into voltage pulses that are     counted if they are above a pre-set threshold.  Analog measurement     of the multiplier current is used to determine the in-flight     multiplier gain.       The Flight Computer uses a 16-bit Marconi MA31750 microprocessor     running at 10 MHz, with 64 K primary RAM, 64 K ROM, and 32 K     extra RAM (used only for data storage, not for execution of     flight software).  The computer controls the INMS measurement     sequence, counts the detector pulses, provides analog-to-digital     conversion of the detector current, and monitors instrument     housekeeping parameters.  The computer is programmed in Ada as the     target language with some use of assembly language to handle     time-critical functions, input/output, and interrupts.  The     instrument ROM/RAM contains the default measurement and test     sequences without requiring memory upload.       OPERATIONAL MODES   ===========================       INMS measurement strategies and sampling methods are determined by     the investigation's science objectives and must take into account     the region and species being sampled.  The basic sampling sequence     is the 'scan' which is a series of 68 mass/charge measurements;     the mass numbers to be sampled in each scan are specified by a     particular 'Mass Table'.  Each measurement period or 'integration     period' (IP) lasts 34 ms (a 31-ms counting period plus ~3 ms for     set up and read out).  Each scan therefore requires 2.3 s (= 34 ms     per sample x 68 IPs or samples).  A scan or series of scans to be     repeated constitutes a 'cycle' The operation of the instrument for     each scan in a cycle is defined by a 'Cycle Table' which indicates     the mass table and other control tables to be used for a     particular scan.  One or more cycles make up a 'science sequence'.     A science sequence is initiated by receipt of a time-tagged     'trigger' command from the Orbiter. Trigger commands will be sent     from the ground to the Orbiter and stored in the Solid State     Recorder (SSR) for later execution; under some circumstances, it     may be possible to command an orbital sequence from the ground in     real time.  The cycles to be performed during the sequence are     identified in a 'Sequence Table', which also specifies a velocity     constant used to modify the quad lens voltages for velocity     compensation in the open source mode.  Several science sequences     were defined prior to SOI.  Additional sequences are expected to     be designed and uploaded to the INMS flight computer once     exploration of the Saturn system is under way.       Default Science Sequence     ------------------------         The 'Default Science - 1498bps' sequence is the basic sequence       executed by the INMS unless another orbital sequence has been       commanded.  This sequence comprises two cycles.  In Cycle 1, the       instrument performs two unitary survey scans from 1 to 8 and 12       to 70 Daltons (Mass Table 1 for CSN and 26 for OSI), the first       in the closed source mode and the second in the open source ion       mode.  Cycle 1 is performed in 4.6 s and repeated for ~30       minutes (389 scans in each mode). Cycle 2 consists of       alternating survey scans in the open source ion mode and in the       closed source mode.  Mass Tables 2-13 for CSN and 27-38 for OSI,       covering the mass ranges 0.5-8.5 and 11.5-99.5, are used for       both surveys in Cycle 2.  Cycle 2 takes 55.2 s to execute.  The       sequence is looped until a different sequence is commanded.         There are three other Default Science sequences, each tailored       to a specific data rate: 100, 50 and 6.2 bits per second (bps).       These rates are designed to make use of the co-adding function       of the INMS, while keeping a very similar measurement order and       timing to the full rate Default Science mode.       Titan Exploratory Sequence     --------------------------       The 'Titan Exploratory - TA' Sequence will be executed during       the Orbiter's first two flybys of Titan (Ta: Oct. 2004, Tb: Dec.       2004) and will occur at an altitude of approximately 1250 km.       The initial flybys will take place prior to the descent of the       Hugyens Probe (Tc: Jan. 2005).  Execution of this sequence will       initiate the INMS investigation of Titan's thermosphere and       ionosphere, which is the primary science objective of the INMS       experiment. In addition the INMS measurements of atmospheric       density made during the initial flybys will be operationally as       well as scientifically important because they will allow       assessment of atmospheric drag effects on the Orbiter during       subsequent flybys at lower altitudes.         The Titan Exploratory Sequence is composed of five cycles and is       designed to characterize the major neutral species in Titan's       upper atmosphere.  The INMS will execute Cycle 1 from an       altitude of ~10,000 km until ~180 seconds before Titan closest       approach.  Two scans will be performed in sequence, first in the       closed source mode (using mass tables 16 and 17) and then in the       open source neutral mode (using mass tables 54 and 55).  As       specified by these two tables, the INMS will alternate sampling       of masses 2, 16, 17, 28, and 29 with mass surveys in 1-Dalton       increments until the entire mass range of 1-99 Daltons       (excluding 9-11 Daltons) has been covered.  Repeated measurement       of masses 2, 16, 17, 28, and 29 during the two scans will       provide high-temporal-resolution data on the density profiles of       the principal neutral and ion species known or expected to be       present in Titan's atmosphere: H2 (2), CH4 (16), N2 (28), H2CN+       (28), CH5+ (17), and C2H5+ (29).  With these data, scale heights       can be calculated with a resolution of 3 km, thus allowing       the detailed structure of Titan's upper atmosphere to be       determined.  After ~1435 s, Cycle 2 will start, performing the       same mass scans as Cycle 1 but with a slightly different       velocity compensation value to reflect the changing       Titan-relative radial velocity of Cassini.  Cycle 3 will start       ~18 s before closest approach.  In Cycle 3 the INMS will perform       an alternating sequence of adaptive/unitary scans (Mass Tables       16 and 17 for CSN) and adaptive/fractional scans (Mass Tables       18/19 for CSN and 56/57 for OSNB).  Throughout all of these       scans, masses 2, 16, 17, 28, and 29 will be sampled at the same       rate, to keep a consistent measurement of the primary       constituents of Titan's atmosphere.  At ~18 seconds after       closest approach the INMS will perform Cycle 2 followed by Cycle       1 ~160 seconds later in an exact mirror of the beginning of the       sequence.       Titan High-Altitude Neutral Atmosphere and Ionosphere Sequence     --------------------------------------------------------------       The 'Titan High-Altitude Ionosphere Flyby' Sequence will be used       during Titan flybys at altitudes above 1500 km, i.e., above the       exobase (~1425 km).  This sequence consists of a single repeated       cycle identical to Cycle 1 in the 'Titan Exploratory - TA'       Sequence with OSI replacing OSNB mode.  It thus will provide       both the survey data needed to characterize the composition of       Titan's exosphere and ionosphere and the       high-temporal-resolution data on the expected major constituents       (masses 2, 16, 17, 28, and 29) needed to establish the structure       of the upper atmosphere.       Titan Low-Altitude Aeronomy Sequence     ------------------------------------       The 'Titan Low-Altitude 006TI_T5' Sequence is designed for       composition measurements at altitudes as low as is consistent       with Orbiter safety (this version is specifically tailored to the       5th Titan Pass).   Several such low-altitude passes, with       spacecraft orientation optimized to point the open source       aperture into the spacecraft ram direction, are required for       successful completion of the INMS science investigation.  A       minimum flyby altitude of 950 km has been selected for these       passes, based on densities predicted by theoretical models.       Flybys at this altitude will allow for data acquisition well       below the ionospheric peak and the homopause - both of which are       predicted to occur at ~1050 km [STROBELETAL1992] [FOX&YELLE1997]       [KELLERETAL1998] - and well into the region where the       photochemical production of complex hydrocarbons and nitriles is       initiated.  At this altitude, the INMS will be able to measure       with maximum sensitivity minor species, including short-lived       chemically active neutral and ion species that play an important       role in titan's photochemistry and ion-neutral chemistry.       Outer Magnetosphere Sequence     -----------------------------       There are two different versions of the Outer Magnetosphere       Sequence, one for purely neutral measurements (used during the       inbound leg of the orbit) and one for ion and neutral       measurements (used during the outbound leg of the orbit).  Each       of these measures the same mass values in the same order, but       uses OSNB or OSI mode, respectively, for the second set of       measurements.  Ve-locity compensation values were selected to       account for expected spacecraft-relative velocities of particles       in Keplarian, corotating or magnetic-field-aligned orbits.       There are also 4 different data rate modes currently available,       just as there are for Default Science: 1498, 100, 50, and 6.2       bps, with 1, 15, 30, and 240 co-added scans, respectively.         Because densities are expected to be low, long accumulation       periods will be used and the mass scans co-added to improve       counting statistics.  Mass Tables 25 (CSN) and 44 (OSNB) are       used for exclusively neutral measurements and 25 (CSN) and 63       (OSI) are used to sample ions; masses of particular interest are       14 (N, N+), 16 (O, O+), 17 (OH, OH+), 18 (H2O, H2O+), and 28       (N2/H2CN, N2+/H2CN+).       Inner Magnetosphere Sequence     ----------------------------       The organization of these sequences is very similar to that of the       'Outer Magnetosphere' sequences: a single mass range sampled       alternately in CSN and OSNB or CSN and OSI modes.  The choice of       neutral or ion and neutral is the same as used for the outer       magnetosphere: neutral for inbound and ion and neutral for       outbound. The four data rates are organized in the same way.       Neutral particles in Keplerian orbits closer to Saturn will move       faster, and the velocity compensation values were increased       accordingly. The Mass Tables used - 14 for CSN, 39       for OSI and 53 for OSNB - involve repeated       measurement of masses 12-19 interleaved with measurements of the       mass ranges 1-8, 20-27, 28-35, and 26-47 Daltons.  This provides       for the repeated sampling during each scan of the water group       neutrals O (16), OH (17), and H2O (18), and ions O+ (16), OH+       (17), H2O+ (18), and H3O+.  Although the densities of these       species are expected to be at a maximum near the predicted       source regions, they will still be at the lower end of the INMS       sensitivity.       Ring Overflight for SOI     -----------------------       The 'Ring Overflight for SOI' Sequence is designed to sample the       neutral and plasma environments of the rings and icy satellites       in Saturn's inner magnetosphere and will be executed during the       overflight of the rings following SOI.  A modified version of       this sequence could also be used during the planned flybys of       Iapatus, Enceladus, Dione, and Rhea.  Because the INMS team has       primary spacecraft axis control during a period after SOI, a       specific sequence was designed to cover this period.  The Mass       Tables used are the same as those used in the 'Inner       Magnetosphere' sequences, but the timing is different.  The       first ~700 s of the measurement period centers on       magnetic-field-aligned and corotating ions, while the next ~480       s will measure neutrals corotating and in Keplerian orbits.       Velocity compensation values were chosen to match the Cassini-       relative velocities of particles in each type of orbit at that       time period, based on estimated particle masses and energies.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:ipp.p10,IMAGING PHOTOPOLARIMETER for P10,IMAGING PHOTOPOLARIMETER,"         The Imaging Photopolarimeter (IPP) for Pioneer 10 operated in 3 modes, with their          main difference being in their sensitivity and instantaneous field of view.                  The most sensitive mode was not used at encounter. It was used during the          mission's interplanetary phase to measure the integrated starlight from the Galaxy,         the Zodiacal Light, and Gegenschein (also called counterglow).                  The photometric and polarimetric modes obtained data on Jupiter over a wide range          of phase angles and distances. These data provided new knowledge about the size,          shape, and refractive index of cloud particles, as well as the gas abundance          above the clouds.                   The photometric mode also produced data that were digitally processed into images          of Jupiter. The spin of the spacecraft swept a small telescope across the planet          in narrow 0.03 degree wide strips, viewing the planet in red and blue light.         A visual image of the planet was built up through the processing of these strips.           Adapted from FIMMELETAL chapter 4. See also Appendix 1.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:irtf-maunakea.3m2.spex,SpeX,SpeX,"Up-to-date as of October 12, 2023 from the IRTF/SpeX website  Introduction SpeX is a medium-resolution 0.7-5.3 micron spectrograph built at the Institute for Astronomy (IfA), for the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) on Mauna Kea. The instrument saw first light in May 2000 and was upgraded in 2014. The primary reason for the upgrade was to replace obsolete array control and instrument control electronics although the opportunity was taken to upgrade the arrays as well. The Raytheon Aladdin 3 1024x1024 InSb array in the spectrograph was replaced by a Teledyne 2048x2048 Hawaii-2RG array and the engineering grade Aladdin 2 512x512 InSb array in the IR slit viewer was replaced by the science grade Aladdin 3 array from the spectrograph (only a 512x512 quadrant is used). Astronomical Research Cameras, Inc. controllers run both arrays. Most of the warm electronic hardware was also replaced: motors, motor controllers, Hall effect sensor control, power supplies, computers and GUIs. For most observing programs guiding is done with the IR slit viewer on spillover flux from the object in the slit. However, for optically visible objects selectable IR transmitting and visible reflecting dichroics in SpeX feed the MORIS CCD camera attached to the side of SpeX to enable guiding in the visible. MORIS is also used as a scientific CCD imager and for simultaneous optical and IR observations in conjunction with SpeX.  The upgrade has resulted in increased simultaneous (one shot) wavelength coverage in all spectral modes and improved spectral sensitivity (0.25-0.5 mags). Due to the faster computers instrument control is more robust and there are fewer software problems.  SpeX was originally funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) in 1996 with additional funding from NASA for the detector arrays in 1998. The SpeX Upgrade was funded by NSF in 2008 but delays in procurement of a science grade H2RG array delayed completion until 2014.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:issna.co,IMAGING SCIENCE SUBSYSTEM - NARROW ANGLE for CO,IMAGING SCIENCE SUBSYSTEM - NARROW ANGLE,"               Introduction to the Cassini Imaging Science Subsystem:                             Narrow Angle Camera   Instrument Overview ===================   The Cassini ISS consists of two fixed focal length telescopes, a narrow angle camera (NAC) and a wide angle camera (WAC). The NAC is 95 cm long and 40 cm x 33 cm wide, and has a focal length of 2002.70 +/- 0.07 mm in the clear filter. The two cameras together have a mass of 57.83 kg, and sit on the Remote Sensing Palette (RSP), fixed to the body of the Cassini Orbiter, between the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) and the Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS), and above the Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (UVIS). The apertures and radiators of both telescopes are parallel to each other.   The NAC has its own set of optics, mechanical mountings, CCD, shutter, filter wheel assembly, temperature sensors, heaters, and electronics, the latter of which consists of two parts: the sensor head subassembly and the main electronics subassembly. The Sensor Head electronics supports the operation of the CCD detector and the preprocessing of the pixel data. The Main Electronics provide the power and perform all other ISS control functions, including generating and maintaining internal timing which is synchronized to the Command Data System (CDS) timing of 8 Hz, control of heaters, and the two hardware data compressors. The Cassini Engineering Flight Computer (EFC) is a radiation-hardened processor that controls the timing, internal sequencing, mechanism control, engineering and status data acquisition, and data packetization.   The NAC is an f/10.5 reflecting telescope with an image scale of ~6 microrad/pixel, a 0.35 deg x 0.35 deg field of view (FOV), and a spectral range from 200 nm - 1100 nm. Its filter wheel subassembly carries 24 spectral filters: 12 filters on each of two wheels. This allows for in-line combinations of filters for greater flexibility. Each wheel is designed to move independently, in either the forward or reverse direction, at a rate of 3 positions per second. A homing sensor on each wheel defines a home wheel position, and wheel positioning can be commanded absolutely or relatively.   Unlike the WAC, the NAC is thermally isolated from the RSP in order to minimize the effects of RSP thermal transients on the NAC image quality.   The temperature of the CCD is controlled by a passive radiator, directly connected to the focal plane, along with an active 'performance' heater on the CCD to adjust the temperature. The temperature of the optical elements is controlled by active heaters positioned along the optical path. These optical elements are kept to within 1 degree Celsius to maintain camera focus without an active focusing mechanism. Low expansion invar spacers are also used. The radiator subassembly also includes two sets of spacecraft-controlled decontamination heaters which are used to minimize deposition of volatile contaminants on either the detector or radiator and to minimize radiation damage to the CCD. All heaters are commandable (ON or OFF) during flight.   Optics ------   The narrow angle camera optics were specially designed to improve on the quality and resolution of images of the bodies in the Saturn system returned by Voyager. It is based on a Ritchey-Chretien reflector design. The focal plane field of view is limited by the size of the CCD. The NAC point spread function (PSF) was designed to be approximately the same physical size as a pixel in the near-IR. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the PSFs of the NAC through the clear filters is 1.3 pixels. The nominal pixel scale is 5.9907 microradians/pixel.   All the reflective optical elements within the NAC (the primary and secondary mirrors) are manufactured of fused silica; all refractive NAC elements (such as the field correctors and the window on the sealed CCD package) are made of either fused silica or single-crystal vacuum-UV-grade calcium fluoride. Antireflection coatings consisting of single layer MgFl2 were deposited on the field correctors and CCD window; a multi-layer MgFl2 coating was applied to the primary and secondary aluminum-coated mirrors to enhance reflectivity. A fused silica quartz plug is placed immediately in front of the CCD package to protect the detector against radiation damage and to minimize radiation- induced noise in the images.   Geometric fidelity in the NAC is very good: pre-flight analytical calculations indicate distortions of less than a pixel at the corners of the field of view, and subsequent observations of the Pleiades and the open cluster M35 set the value to 0.45 pixels.   Filters -------   The ISS filter assembly design -- consisting of two filter wheels and a filter changing mechanism -- is inherited from the Hubble Space Telescope WF/PC camera. Each wheel is designed to move independently, in either the forward or reverse direction, at a rate of 3 positions per second in the NAC. A homing sensor on each wheel defines a home wheel position: wheel positioning can be commanded absolutely or relatively.   The Cassini Imaging Science Team has deliberately duplicated 63% of the filters in both the NAC and WAC. These include seven medium/broadband filters from the blue to the near-IR for spectrophotometry, 2 methane and 2 continuum band filters for atmospheric vertical sounding, 2 clear filters, and a narrow band H alpha filter for lightning observations.   The clear filter is in the 'home' slot of each filter wheel, since it was deemed that sticking of a filter wheel, should it occur, was most likely to occur in the home position. Typically a clear filter in one wheel is combined with a color filter in the other wheel, though two-filter combinations can also be used.   Because of its reflecting optics and its unique ability to see in the UV, only the NAC carries filters for UV observations. The lumigen coating provides a unique spectral capability, unavailable on either the Voyager or Galileo imaging systems, which Cassini carries to the outer solar system for the first time. It enables spectral response down to 200 nm. To take advantage of this capability, we have spanned the range from 230 nm to 390 nm with three UV filters: UV1, UV2, and UV3.   The NAC filter wheel also contains narrow-band filters for atmospheric studies. Methane absorption bands and continuum wavelengths are available using the MT1/CB1, MT2/CB2 and MT3/CB3 filters. (CB1 is a 2-lobed continuum filter, with lobes on each side of the methane absorption band.) A HAL filter is also included for observing H-alpha emissions from lightning.   Finally, the NAC carries three polarization filters covering the visible spectrum: P0, P60 and P120. As their names indicate, these polarizers have principle transmission axes separated by 60 degrees, in order to measure intensity and the degree and direction of linear polarization regardless of camera orientation. The NAC also has a single infrared polarizer, IRP0.   The polarizers are, of course, to be used in combination with other spectral filters, so filter placement was important. In the NAC, the 3 visible polarizers and the one IR polarizer can all be used in conjunction with a suite of spectral filters on the opposite wheel covering the UV to the near-IR.

Central wavelengths (lambda_cen) are computed using the full system transmission function. Effective wavelengths (lambda_eff) are computed using the full system transmission function convolved with a solar spectrum. Bandpass types: SP = short wavelength cutoff; W = wide; N = narrow; LP = long wavelength cutoff.)   With the exception of the clear filters and the polarizers, the filters are all interference filters manufactured using an ion-aided deposition (IAD) process which has the effect of making the filters temperature and moisture tolerant, and resistant to delamination. Conventional interference filters have passbands which shift with temperature. The shift can be significant for narrowband filters targeted to methane absorption bands or the H_alpha line. Temperature shifts for IAD filters is typically an order of magnitude or more smaller than for conventional filters and is insignificant over the temperature range (room temperature to 0 degrees C) relevant to calibration and operation of the Cassini cameras.   The NAC visible polarizers consist of a thin film (less than 1 microns thick) of a polarizing polymer deposited between two fused silica plates. The infrared polarizer has a 1 mm-thick layer of Polarcor (trademark Corning) cemented between two slabs of BK7-G18 glass. Polarcor is a borosilicate glass impregnated with fine metallic wires. Ideal polarizers block only photons whose electric vector is orthogonal to the principal axis of the polarizer. The visible polarizers fall short of this ideal behavior in two ways. They transmit too little of either polarization in the ultraviolet, and too much of the light polarized orthogonal to the principal axis in the near-infrared. Their performance is best between 450 nm and 650 nm where the principal axis transmission is between 0.45 and 0.65, and the orthogonal transmission is less than 1%. The useable range of the visible polarizers extends from the UV3 filter near 350 nm to the CB2 filter at 750 nm. The infrared polarizer has much better performance over its range (700 nm - 1100 nm) where the principal transmission is greater than 0.9 and the orthogonal transmission is 0.001 or less.   Shutter -------   Between the filter wheel assembly and the CCD detector is the shutter assembly, a two blade, focal plane electromechanical system derived from that used on Voyager, Galileo and WFPC. To reduce scattered light, the shutter assembly was put in the optical train `backwards , with the unreflective side towards the focal plane. Each blade moves independently, actuated by its own permanent magnet rotary solenoid, in the sample direction: i.e., keeping the blade edge parallel to the columns of the CCD. The shutter assembly is operated in 3-phases: open (one blade sweeps across the CCD), close (the other blade sweeps across the CCD to join the first), and reset (both blades simultaneously sweep across the CCD in the reverse direction to the start position).   There are 64 commandable exposure settings which can be updated during flight if so desired. These correspond to 63 different exposure times, ranging from 5 milliseconds to 20 minutes, and one `No Operation setting. The shortest nonzero exposure is 5 msec. In the ISS flight software, the time tag on the image is the time of the close of the shutter. Because of mechanical imperfections in the shutter mechanism, there is a difference between the commanded exposure time and the actual exposure time, and a gradient in exposure time across the CCD columns. At an operating temperature of 0 degrees C, the mean differences in the NAC for commanded exposure times of 5, 25 and 100 ms were measured to be 0.98, 1.52 and 0.97 ms, respectively. In all cases the actual exposure times are less than the commanded times. There is also a small temperature dependence to these shutter offsets.   The 1024th column is illuminated first in both cameras. In the NAC, this column is illuminated for ~ 0.3 msecs longer than the first column. This value is independent of exposure time and reasonably independent of temperature. The expected precision or repeatability of an exposure (equal to the standard deviation of actual exposure durations measured at any one location on the CCD in ground tests) is </= 0.03 msec for the NAC. Corrections for the mean and the spatially-dependent shutter offsets are incorporated into the Cassini ISS calibration software (CISSCAL). The shutters were tested for light leak. None was detectable in the NAC at a fluence level of 12,000 times full well exposure on the closed shutter.   Detector --------   The CCD detector used in the Cassini ISS was manufactured by Loral, packaged by JPL, and employs three phase, front-side-illuminated architecture. The imaging area -- the region on which light is focused -- is a square array of 1024 x 1024 pixels, each 12 microns on a side. The CCDs on both cameras were packaged, hermetically sealed and fronted by a fused silica window.   The CCD's response to light is determined by the spectral dependence of each pixel's quantum efficiency: i.e., the number of electrons released in the silicon layer for each photon incident on it. In front-side-illuminated CCDs (like that in the Cassini ISS), the overlying polysilicon gate structures don t transmit UV light. To achieve the required UV response, a UV-sensitive organic fluorescent material called lumogen was vacuum-deposited onto the CCD at 80 degrees C after it was bonded. In this 0.6 micron layer, UV photons are converted into visible photons in the 540 to 580 nm range that readily penetrate the silicon below. Under vacuum conditions, the lumogen layer would tend to evaporate when CCD temperatures reached 60 degrees C. For this reason, the CCD sealed packages were back-filled with inert argon gas to a half atmosphere pressure. All flight candidate CCDs were coated with lumogen before the two flight CCDs were chosen and assigned to each camera.   The efficiency of a CCD in the near-IR depends on its thickness, or more precisely on the thickness of the very thin, high purity silicon layer which is epitaxially grown over a thicker (~500 micron) substrate. It is the photons absorbed in the epitaxial layer that are converted into the signal electrons that are subsequently collected and sampled. Nearly all of the near-IR photons actually penetrate beyond the epi layer and create charge in the substrate. However, the purity contrast between the substrate and the epi layer prevents substrate-generated charge from entering the epi layer and being collected. Thus, the 1100 nm quantum efficiency is essentially the fraction of incident flux which is absorbed in the thin layer of pure silicon: the thicker the epi layer, the higher the infrared sensitivity. However, the thicker this layer, the lower the spatial resolution. A compromise was made in the manufacture of the CCD to yield some response near 1100 nm while maintaining high spatial resolution. The epi layer is 10 - 12 microns thick on Cassini and results in a quantum efficiency (QE) of ~1% at 1000 nm.   A compromise involving the near-IR response was also made in choosing the CCD operating temperature. At Saturn, this temperature is -90 +/- 0.2 degrees C and is a compromise between yielding an acceptably low dark current (</= 0.3 e-/sec/pixel) and maintaining a reasonable near-IR response (which is diminished at low temperatures). CCD thermal control is achieved by means of balance between passive radiation to space, which alone would maintain the CCD below its operating temperature at Saturn, and active heater control. The radiator of each camera also supports a decontamination heater (35 watts in all) that can heat the CCD to +35 degrees C to reduce the deposition of volatile contaminants on either the detector or the radiator. (Because damage to the CCD due to cosmic rays can be annealed at elevated temperatures, the CCD operating temperature during cruise, when data were not being collected, was maintained at 0 degrees C to minimize such damage.)   The detector system includes an unilluminated region 8 samples wide - the 'extended pixel' region - extending into the negative sample direction in the serial register. These pixels get read out first. Moreover, once an entire row of 1024 pixels is read up into the serial register and out to the signal chain, the read-out continues for 8 more clock cycles, or 'overclocked pixels,' to provide a measure of the offset bias, the DN value that corresponds to zero signal level. The extended pixel region and the overclocked pixels in principle provide two independent measures of offset bias and a sample of the horizontal banding pattern that may be used to remove the pattern in images lacking dark sky. (A discussion of the horizontal banding problem can be found in [PORCOETAL2004].)   In the NAC, the extended region of the readout register, and the first 13 columns into the serial register are corrupted by a grounding problem with the epoxy that bonds the pure silicon layer to the substrate. This causes spurious swings in the voltage during the initial 'clockings' of data out of the CCD into the signal chain. Consequently, these columns of CCD data are unreliable, and the NAC's extended pixel region cannot be used to monitor the camera's bias or noise state.     Scientific Objectives =====================   See [PORCOETAL2004] for an in-depth description of Cassini ISS science objectives.     Camera Operation ================   Operational States ------------------   The ISS has three operational power states: On, Sleep and Off. In the On state, the cameras are Active or Idle. In this state, both the spacecraft replacement heaters and ISS decontamination heaters are off. The camera software has active control over the performance heaters to set appropriate operating temperatures for the optics and CCD detector. The Active sub-state is entered to collect science data as well as for calibration and maintenance activities. Command execution in the active state includes science data readout, filter wheel movement, shutter movement, activation of light flood and calibration lamps, and other high power consuming activities. Idle is a background state in which no commands are executing. When the camera is in Idle, uploads can be processed, real-time and 'trigger' commands can be accepted from the CDS, and macros can be stored. The execution of any command sends the camera into the Active state. The camera always returns to Idle state after completing a command sequence. In the NAC, peak power consumption during active imaging is 26.2 watts.   The ISS Sleep state is a non-data taking low power state that is used when no activity is planned for an extended period of time. During this state, the sensor head and main ISS electronics are drawing power, and the optics and CCD heaters are on to maintain operating temperature limits. Spacecraft controlled replacement heaters are off. The decontamination heaters may be used, if necessary. In Sleep, the NAC consumes 22.3 watts.   In OFF, no power is drawn by the ISS. The spacecraft controlled replacement heaters and ISS decontamination heaters may be turned on when necessary. The replacement heaters keep the ISS within allowable flight nonoperating temperature limits and the decontamination heaters can be used to provide for CCD protection from the radiation environment and from the condensation of volatiles. In this state, the NAC consumes 8.4 watts.   Detector Modes --------------   The CCD has the capability of being commanded to operate in full mode (i.e., 1x1) or either 2x2 or 4x4 on-chip pixel summation modes. The latter two modes are used for either enhancing signal-to-noise and/or decreasing the data volume and/or read-out time at the expense of spatial resolution. The full well of the CCD is roughly 120,000 e-/pixel. Four gain states are available: for imaging faint objects (high gain, Gain 3) and bright objects (normal gain, Gain 2), and to match the output of the 2x2 (Gain 1) and 4x4 (Gain 0) full wells. The summation well can hold only 1.6 x 10^6 electrons; this corresponds to full well with 4X4 summing. However, the relation between number of electrons in the signal and the digital data numbers (DN) into which the signal is encoded starts to become nonlinear above 10^6 electrons because at this signal level, the on-chip amplifier becomes non-linear. For this reason, in the lowest gain state (Gain 0), the full scale signal is set to correspond to ~ 10^6 electrons at 4095 DN.   Table 3: NAC Gain States   Gain State   e-/DN       Notes ---------------------------------------------------------------- 0            233 +/- 29  Designed for 4x4 summation mode 1            99 +/- 13   Designed for 2x2 summation mode 2            30 +/- 3    Normal gain; used in 1x1 summation mode 3            13 +/- 2    Used in 1x1; chosen to match read noise   The capability also exists within the ISS to reduce the effect of blooming, the phenomenon whereby a highly overexposed pixel can spill electrons along an entire column of pixels, and sometimes along a row, when the full well of the CCD is exceeded. The default camera setup has anti-blooming on, with the option to turn it off. Anti-blooming mode is achieved by applying an AC voltage to the chip, forcing excess electrons into the silicon substrate. An undesirable side effect of this action is to pump electrons into traps in the silicon at the expense of electrons in adjacent pixels. For long exposures this produces bright/dark pixel pairs. These were initially present in nearly all the NAC flat field files obtained during calibration in the thermal vacuum chamber. Corrected flat field files with these pixel pairs removed have since been created.   Camera Commanding -----------------   The acquisition of images can be accomplished in several ways. Individual NAC or frames may be acquired, or the NAC and WAC can be used in simultaneous mode, called BOTSIM (for 'both simultaneous'). The entire event, which is called a framing event and requires a total duration called a 'framing time', is broken down into two steps: the prepare cycle and the readout cycle.   The prepare cycle is used to alter the state of the ISS, step the filter wheels, perform heater operations, light flooding, and other functions required to prepare for an exposure. It also includes the exposure time. The prepare cycle is constructed from a series of quantized windows of time in which specific functions are assigned to occur.   During the prepare cycle, the shutter blades are reset from the previous exposure and the filter wheels are moved into position. Because simultaneous motion of each filter wheel requires more power than the ISS was allocated for peak operation, all filter wheels NAC and WAC -- are moved separately. Windows of quantized duration are set aside for the motion of each filter wheel. Next, the CCD is prepared for exposure to light. This preparation begins with a wait; the duration of the wait is chosen to ensure that the shutter will close exactly at the end of the prepare cycle. After the wait, a light-flood fills the wells of the CCD to many (~ 50) times saturation, followed immediate by a read out. The entire light-flood/erase event takes 950 msec and has the effect of erasing any residual image of previous exposures from the CCD. Within 5 msec of the end of the light-flood/erase event, the shutter is opened for the commanded duration. (For dark frames, this duration is set to zero.) The image is tagged with the time of shutter close.   During a BOTSIM, the prepare cycle is lengthened to include time to prepare both NAC and WAC. The NAC is prepared first; then the WAC is prepared so as to avoid simultaneous movement of any of the 4 filter wheels. If the NAC and WAC exposure times are different, the exposures begin in a staggered fashion so that the NAC and WAC shutters are closed simultaneously. There are 63 discrete commandable exposure times which are accommodated within 13 discrete prepare cycle windows.   During the following readout window, the CCD is read out, the data are encoded and/or compressed, and the results are packetized. For any of the 6 individual CDS pickup rates, there are 4 discrete readout windows for each camera. The readout window is scaled by the CDS pickup rate giving 24 actual readout windows per camera and 96 actual BOTSIM readout windows.   Prepare times and readout times are chosen before uplink. The prepare cycle is completely determinate; the readout time required to fully read out an image is not. The required readout time during the image event will depend on the amount of data being read out of the CCD, and the CDS pickup rate or on the line readout rate from the CCD, whichever is slowest. If the data volume in the image was underestimated and the required readout time exceeds the commanded readout time, the camera will cease reading out part way through an image and lines will be lost. For this reason, a great deal of effort has gone into the amount of data returned for different scenes and choices of compression parameters.   The ISS can collect pixel (image) data, engineering data and status data, and packetize them with appropriate header information as either science telemetry packets (which include all types of data) or housekeeping packets (which only include engineering and status data). The latter are returned alone when ISS is in an ON power state but not actively taking images. The frequency with which housekeeping packets are collected is 1 packet/sec and is programmable in flight. The amount of housekeeping data that gets sent to the ground is determined by the rate at which CDS picks up such packets and is currently 1 housekeeping packet every 64 seconds.   Data paths ----------   The analog to digital (A/D) conversion happens right as the analog signal is read out from the chip, after it has passed through the on-chip amplifier. Data from the ADC are encoded to 12-bit data numbers (DN), giving a dynamic range of 4096. However, they are stored as 16-bits: the upper 4-bits are all 1 s. The ISS flight software masks the upper 4 bits when doing calculations. Compression and conversion functions are performed after the electrons are converted to DN. The next juncture is a choice of data conversion (from 12 to 8 bits) or no data conversion. Unconverted data can then proceed to a lossless compressor or undergo no compression at all. Converted data can undergo no compression or lossless or lossy compression. From there, the data are placed on the Bus Interface Unit (BIU), where they are ultimately picked up by the Command Data System (CDS) and sent to the Solid State Recorder (SSR) where they are stored as 16-bit data.   Data Compression ----------------   Serious constraints are imposed on imaging of the Saturn system by the limited storage volume on the spacecraft's SSR, and by the limited communication bandwidth back to Earth. In order to make the most effective use of these resources, the Cassini imaging system includes the capability to convert the data from 12 bits to 8 bits (called data conversion), and also to perform either 'lossless' or 'lossy' image compression. Data conversion, and both lossless and lossy compression, are implemented in hardware.      Conversion to 8 bits    --------------------   Two sub-options are available for 8-bit conversion. One is a variant on conventional 'square root' encoding. In such encoding, a look-up table (LUT) is used to convert the original data values to 8-bit values. The output 8-bit values are related to the input values in a non-linear fashion, typically scaling with the square root of the 12-bit value. This non-linear scaling more closely matches the quantization level to the photon shot noise so that the information content is spread more evenly among the 256 levels. (The Cassini 12-to-8 bit conversion table is provided with the calibration data volume.) It differs somewhat from pure square-root encoding, having been designed for the known noise properties of the Cassini cameras to distribute quantization-induced errors uniformly across the dynamic range of the system. The look-up table is stored in ROM within the cameras' memory and cannot be altered in flight; choice of ON or OFF is commandable in flight.   The other sub-option is conversion from 12 bits to the least-significant 8 bits LS8B). This type of conversion is useful for reducing the data volume of images taken of very faint targets, such as diffuse rings or the dark side of Iapetus, which generally do not yield large signal levels and can be encoded to the lowest 8 bits.      Lossless Compression    --------------------   Both converted (8-bit) and unconverted (12-bit) data can be lossless compressed. The ISS lossless hardware compressor is based on Huffman encoding, a high efficiency, numerical encoding scheme in which the length of the bit sequence used to encode a given number is chosen based on the frequency of occurrence of that number. In ISS lossless compression, each compressed image can be reconstructed on the ground with no loss to the information content of the image, provided the image entropy does not exceed the threshold where 2:1 compression is achieved. Scenes with low entropy will have compression ratios higher than 2:1; scenes with high entropy will never compress greater than 2:1, but the ends of lines will be truncated so that the total amount of data returned in a pair of lines of the image never exceeds the total number of bits for a single uncompressed line. The truncation scheme has been designed so that the truncation alternates -- i.e., every other line -- from one line to the next, on the right (large sample number) side of the image. If the data loss is great, it can in principle result in the complete loss of every other line. In either case, with this scheme, information (though reduced in spatial resolution) can be retained across the image.      Lossy Compression    -----------------   Imaging sequences requiring larger compression ratios than can be achieved with the lossless compressor may instead be more strongly compressed using the camera's lossy compression circuitry. This capability requires that the data have been converted to the 8-bit form. Consequently, data conversion must be employed first before the data are sent to the lossy compressor. Compression is implemented by a pair of specialized signal processing chips which perform a variation on the familiar JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) compression algorithm used in many image transfer and storage applications. The JPEG algorithm operates by selectively removing information from an image, particularly at high spatial frequencies. Lossy-compressed images thus tend to have reduced detail on fine scales.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:jno.rss,Gravity Science Instrument for Juno,Gravity Science Instrument,"      Instrument Overview     ===================        The gravity science instrument utilizes the X and Ka-band transponders       on-board the Juno spacecraft and Doppler tracking equipment at       the Deep Space Network to perform radio science investigations       to determine the gravitational field of celestial bodies.       The spacecraft part of the radio science instrument is       described immediately below; that is followed by a description       of the DSN (ground) part of the instrument. For more       information about the Juno spacecraft and mission, see       [MATOUSEK2006].       Instrument Specifications - Spacecraft     ======================================        Instrument Id                  : RSS       Instrument Host Id             : JUNO       Pi Pds User Id                 : UNK       Instrument Name                : GRAVITY SCIENCE INSTRUMENT       Instrument Type                : RADIO SCIENCE       Build Date                     : UNK       Instrument Mass                : UNK       Instrument Length              : UNK       Instrument Width               : UNK       Instrument Height              : UNK       Instrument Manufacturer Name   : UNK       Instrument Overview - Spacecraft     ================================                The Juno telecommunications system operates at X-band and Ka-band         to support the gravity science investigation at Jupiter. The         X-band transponder onboard the spacecraft provides the primary         communications and telemetry with the ground station. The         Ka-band telemetry system is augmented with a Ka-band Translator         and downconverter enabling a two-way Ka-band radio science link         to the Deep Space Network. The X-band and Ka-band systems can be         operated simultaneously for dual X-up/X-down and Ka-up/Ka-down.         The ground station uplinks a carrier to the spacecraft which         the receiver acquires and tracks. The spacecraft then transmits         a signal that is coherent with the uplink signal received. When         no uplink signal is present, the downlink signal was         referenced to the auxiliary oscillator. Data that are         noncoherent contains too much Doppler noise to be useful         for gravity science.      Science Objectives     ==================       The radio tracking data are used to improve knowledge of       the magnitude and direction of Jupiter's gravity field.       The analysis of the interplanetary tracking data (both       range data and VLBI) to Juno can be used to improve the       modeling of the orbit of Jupiter in future versions of the       solar system planetary ephemerides.        Gravity Measurements       --------------------          Measurement of the gravity field provides significant         constraints on inferences about the interior structure of         Jupiter. Precise, detailed study of the spacecraft motion         in Jovian orbit can yield the mass distribution of the         gas giant.          Studies of the gravity field emphasize both the global         field and local characteristics of the field. The first         task is to determine the global field. Doppler and range         tracking measurements yield accurate spacecraft trajectory         solutions. Simultaneously with reconstruction of the         spacecraft orbit, observation equations for field         coefficients and a small number of ancillary parameters         can be solved. This type of gravity field solution is         essential for characterizing tectonic phenomena and can         also be used to study localized features.          'Short-arc' line-of-sight Doppler tracking measurements         obtained when the Earth-to-spacecraft line-of-sight is         within a few degrees of the orbit plane provide the         highest resolution of local features. The results from         this type of observation typically are presented as         contoured acceleration profiles of specific features         (e.g., craters, volcanoes, etc.) or line-of-sight         acceleration maps of specific regions.       Operational Considerations - Spacecraft     =======================================         Ka-band measurements are only available when the onboard         Ka-band Translator is powered on. Ka-band uplink/downlink         is available when the spacecraft is being tracked by          the Deep Space Network's DSS-25 in Goldstone, CA because         it is the only station in the network with a Ka-band         transmitter. During Ka-band tracks not over DSS-25, only         non-coherent Ka-band or Ka-band referenced to the X-band         uplink is available.          During the capture orbit phase, Ka-band checkout passes         were conducted to ensure operational status of the Ka-band         equipment onboard the spacecraft.           Science phase perijoves are all conducted over the DSS-25         antenna in Goldstone, CA. Only X-band data are available         for MWR perijoves. Ka-band and X-band data are available         for GRAV perijoves. See the MISSION.CAT for details on         perijove types and dates.               Investigators     =============                 Folkner, William (Juno Gravity Science Co-I)          Asmar, Sami          Anderson, John          Buccino, Dustin (Juno Gravity Science Instrument Ops)       Instrument Overview - DSN     =========================       Three Deep Space Communications Complexes (DSCCs) (near       Barstow, CA; Canberra, Australia; and Madrid, Spain) comprise       the DSN tracking network.  Each complex is equipped with       several antennas [including at least one each 70-m, 34-m High       Efficiency (HEF), and 34-m Beam WaveGuide (BWG)], associated       electronics, and operational systems.  Primary activity       at each complex is radiation of commands to and reception of       telemetry data from active spacecraft.  Transmission and       reception is possible in several radio-frequency bands, the       most common being S-band (nominally a frequency of 2100-2300       MHz or a wavelength of 14.2-13.0 cm) and X-band (7100-8500 MHz       or 4.2-3.5 cm).  Transmitter output powers of up to 400 kW are       available.        Ground stations have the ability to transmit coded and uncoded       waveforms which can be echoed by distant spacecraft.  Analysis       of the received coding allows navigators to determine the       distance to the spacecraft; analysis of Doppler shift on the       carrier signal allows estimation of the line-of-sight       spacecraft velocity.  Range and Doppler measurements are used       to calculate the spacecraft trajectory and to infer gravity       fields of objects near the spacecraft.        Ground stations can record spacecraft signals that have       propagated through or been scattered from target media.       Measurements of signal parameters after wave interactions with       surfaces, atmospheres, rings, and plasmas are used to infer       physical and electrical properties of the target.        Principal investigators vary from experiment to experiment.       See the corresponding section of the spacecraft instrument       description or the data set description for specifics.        The Deep Space Network is managed by the Jet Propulsion       Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology for the       U.S.  National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

Subsystems - DSN     ================       The Deep Space Communications Complexes (DSCCs) are an integral       part of Radio Science instrumentation, along with the       spacecraft Radio Frequency Subsystem.  Their system performance       directly determines the degree of success of Radio Science       investigations, and their system calibration determines the       degree of accuracy in the results of the experiments.

This material has been       adapted from [ASMARETAL1995]; for additional       information, consult [DSN810-5].        Each DSCC includes a set of antennas, a Signal Processing       Center (SPC), and communication links to the Jet Propulsion       Laboratory (JPL).

The DMC is the center of activity at a DSCC.  The         DMC receives and archives most of the information from the         NOCC needed by the various DSCC subsystems during their         operation.  Control of most of the DSCC subsystems, as well         as the handling and displaying of any responses to control         directives and configuration and status information received         from each of the subsystems, is done through the DMC.  The         effect of this is to centralize the control, display, and         archiving functions necessary to operate a DSCC.         Communication among the various subsystems is done using a         Local Area Network (LAN) hooked up to each subsystem via a         network interface unit (NIU).         DSCC Antenna Mechanical Subsystem       ---------------------------------         Multi-mission Radio Science activities require support from         the 70-m, 34-m HEF, and 34-m BWG antenna subnets.  The         antennas at each DSCC function as large-aperture collectors         which, by double reflection, cause the incoming radio         frequency (RF) energy to enter the feed horns.  The large         collecting surface of the antenna focuses the incoming energy         onto a subreflector, which is adjustable in both axial and         angular position.  These adjustments are made to correct for         gravitational deformation of the antenna as it moves between         zenith and the horizon; the deformation can be as large as         5 cm.  The subreflector adjustments optimize the channeling         of energy from the primary reflector to the subreflector         and then to the feed horns.  The 70-m and 34-m HEF antennas         have 'shaped' primary and secondary reflectors, with forms         that are modified paraboloids.  This customization allows         more uniform illumination of one reflector by another.  The         BWG reflector shape is ellipsoidal.          On the 70-m antennas, the subreflector directs         received energy from the antenna onto a dichroic plate, a         device which reflects S-band energy to the S-band feed horn         and passes X-band energy through to the X-band feed horn.  In         the 34-m HEF, there is one 'common aperture feed,' which         accepts both frequencies without requiring a dichroic plate.         In the 34-m BWG, a series of small mirrors (approximately 2.5         meters in diameter) directs microwave energy from the         subreflector region to a collection area at the base of         the antenna -- typically in a pedestal room.  A retractable         dichroic reflector separates S- and X-band on some BWG         antennas or X- and Ka-band on others.  RF energy to be         transmitted into space by the horns is focused by the         reflectors into narrow cylindrical beams, pointed with high         precision (either to the dichroic plate or directly to the         subreflector) by a series of drive motors and gear trains         that can rotate the movable components and their support         structures.          The different antennas can be pointed by several means.  Two         pointing modes commonly used during tracking passes are         CONSCAN and 'blind pointing.' With CONSCAN enabled and a         closed loop receiver locked to a spacecraft signal, the         system tracks the radio source by conically scanning around         its position in the sky.  Pointing angle adjustments are         computed from signal strength information (feedback) supplied         by the receiver.  In this mode the Antenna Pointing Assembly         (APA) generates a circular scan pattern which is sent to the         Antenna Control System (ACS).  The ACS adds the scan pattern         to the corrected pointing angle predicts.  Software in the         receiver-exciter controller computes the received signal         level and sends it to the APA.  The correlation of scan         position with the received signal level variations allows the         APA to compute offset changes which are sent to the ACS.         Thus, within the capability of the closed-loop control         system, the scan center is pointed precisely at the apparent         direction of the spacecraft signal source.  An additional         function of the APA is to provide antenna position angles and         residuals, antenna control mode/status information, and         predict-correction parameters to the Area Routing Assembly         (ARA) via the LAN, which then sends this information to JPL         via the Ground Communications Facility (GCF) for antenna         status monitoring.          During periods when excessive signal level dynamics or low         received signal levels are expected (e.g., during an         occultation experiment), CONSCAN should not be used.  Under         these conditions, blind pointing (CONSCAN OFF) is used, and         pointing angle adjustments are based on a predetermined         Systematic Error Correction (SEC) model.          Independent of CONSCAN state, subreflector motion in at least         the z-axis may introduce phase variations into the received         Radio Science data.  For that reason, during certain         experiments, the subreflector in the 70-m and 34-m HEFs may         be frozen in the z-axis at a position (often based on         elevation angle) selected to minimize phase change and signal         degradation.  This can be done via Operator Control Inputs         (OCIs) from the LMC to the Subreflector Controller (SRC)         which resides in the alidade room of the antennas.  The SRC         passes the commands to motors that drive the subreflector to         the desired position.          Pointing angles for all antenna types are computed by         the NOCC Support System (NSS) from an ephemeris provided by         the flight project.  These predicts are received and archived         by the CMC.  Before each track, they are transferred to the         APA, which transforms the direction cosines of the predicts         into AZ-EL coordinates.  The LMC operator then downloads the         antenna predict points to the antenna-mounted ACS computer         along with a selected SEC model.  The pointing predicts         consist of time-tagged AZ-EL points at selected time         intervals along with polynomial coefficients for         interpolation between points.          The ACS automatically interpolates the predict points,         corrects the pointing predicts for refraction and         subreflector position, and adds the proper systematic error         correction and any manually entered antenna offsets.  The ACS         then sends angular position commands for each axis at the         rate of one per second.  In the 70-m and 34-m HEF, rate         commands are generated from the position commands at the         servo controller and are subsequently used to steer the         antenna.          When not using binary predicts (the routine mode for         spacecraft tracking), the antennas can be pointed using         'planetary mode' -- a simpler mode which uses right ascension         (RA) and declination (DEC) values.  These change very slowly         with respect to the celestial frame.  Values are provided to         the station in text form for manual entry.  The ACS         quadratically interpolates among three RA and DEC points         which are on one-day centers.          A third pointing mode -- sidereal -- is available for         tracking radio sources fixed with respect to the celestial         frame.          Regardless of the pointing mode being used, a 70-m antenna         has a special high-accuracy pointing capability called         'precision' mode.  A pointing control loop derives the         main AZ-EL pointing servo drive error signals from a two-         axis autocollimator mounted on the Intermediate Reference         Structure.  The autocollimator projects a light beam to a         precision mirror mounted on the Master Equatorial drive         system, a much smaller structure, independent of the main         antenna, which is exactly positioned in HA and DEC with shaft         encoders.  The autocollimator detects elevation/cross-         elevation errors between the two reference surfaces by         measuring the angular displacement of the reflected light         beam.  This error is compensated for in the antenna servo by         moving the antenna in the appropriate AZ-EL direction.         Pointing accuracies of 0.004 degrees (15 arc seconds) are         possible in 'precision' mode.  The 'precision' mode is not         available on 34-m antennas -- nor is it needed, since their         beamwidths are twice as large as on the 70-m antennas.         DSCC Antenna Microwave Subsystem       --------------------------------         70-m Antennas: Each 70-m antenna has three feed cones         installed in a structure at the center of the main reflector.         The feeds are positioned 120 degrees apart on a circle.         Selection of the feed is made by rotation of the         subreflector.  A dichroic mirror assembly, half on the S-band         cone and half on the X-band cone, permits simultaneous use of         the S- and X-band frequencies.  The third cone is devoted to         R and D and more specialized work.          The Antenna Microwave Subsystem (AMS) accepts the received S-         and X-band signals at the feed horn and transmits them         through polarizer plates to an orthomode transducer.  The         polarizer plates are adjusted so that the signals are         directed to a pair of redundant amplifiers for each         frequency, thus allowing simultaneous reception of signals in         two orthogonal polarizations.  For S-band these are two Block         IVA S-band Traveling Wave Masers (TWMs); for X-band the         amplifiers are Block IIA TWMs.          34-m HEF Antennas:  The 34-m HEF uses a single feed for both         S- and X-band.  Simultaneous S- and X-band receive as well as         X-band transmit is possible thanks to the presence of an S/X         'combiner' which acts as a diplexer.  For S-band, RCP or LCP         is user selected through a switch so neither a polarizer nor         an orthomode transducer is needed.  X-band amplification         options include two Block II TWMs or an HEMT Low Noise         Amplifier (LNA).  S-band amplification is provided by an FET         LNA.          34-m BWG Antennas: These antennas use feeds and low-noise         amplifiers (LNA) in the pedestal room, which can be switched         in and out as needed.  Typically the following modes are         available:            1. downlink non-diplexed path (RCP or LCP) to LNA-1, with               uplink in the opposite circular polarization;            2. downlink non-diplexed path (RCP or LCP) to LNA-2, with               uplink in the opposite circular polarization            3. downlink diplexed path (RCP or LCP) to LNA-1, with               uplink in the same circular polarization            4. downlink diplexed path (RCP or LCP) to LNA-2, with               uplink in the same circular polarization         For BWG antennas with dual-band capabilities (e.g., DSS 25)         and dual LNAs, each of the above four modes can be used in a         single-frequency or dual-frequency configuration.  Thus, for         antennas with the most complete capabilities, there are         sixteen possible ways to receive at a single frequency         (2 polarizations, 2 waveguide path choices, 2 LNAs, and 2         bands).         DSCC Receiver-Exciter Subsystem       -------------------------------         The Receiver-Exciter Subsystem is composed of two groups of         equipment: the closed-loop receiver group and the open-loop         receiver group.  This subsystem is controlled by the         Receiver-Exciter Controller (REC) which communicates         directly with the DMC for predicts and OCI reception and         status reporting.          The exciter generates the S-band signal (or X-band for the         34-m HEF only) which is provided to the Transmitter Subsystem         for the spacecraft uplink signal.  It is tunable under         command of the Digitally Controlled Oscillator (DCO) which         receives predicts from the Metric Data Assembly (MDA).          The diplexer in the signal path between the transmitter and         the feed horn for all three antennas (used for simultaneous         transmission and reception) may be configured such that it is         out of the received signal path (in listen-only or bypass         mode) in order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio in the         receiver system.          Closed Loop Receivers: The Block V receiver-exciter at the         70-m stations allows for two receiver channels, each capable         of L-Band (e.g., 1668 MHz frequency or 18 cm wavelength),         S-band, or X-band reception, and an S-band exciter for         generation of uplink signals through the low-power or         high-power transmitter.          The closed-loop receivers provide the capability for rapid         acquisition of a spacecraft signal and telemetry lockup.  In         order to accomplish acquisition within a short time, the         receivers are predict driven to search for, acquire, and         track the downlink automatically.  Rapid acquisition         precludes manual tuning though that remains as a backup         capability.  The subsystem utilizes FFT analyzers for rapid         acquisition.  The predicts are NSS generated, transmitted to         the CMC which sends them to the Receiver-Exciter Subsystem         where two sets can be stored.  The receiver starts         acquisition at uplink time plus one round-trip-light-time or         at operator specified times.  The receivers may also be         operated from the LMC without a local operator attending         them.  The receivers send performance and status data,         displays, and event messages to the LMC.          Either the exciter synthesizer signal or the simulation         (SIM) synthesizer signal is used as the reference for the         Doppler extractor in the closed-loop receiver systems,         depending on the spacecraft being tracked (and Project         guidelines).  The SIM synthesizer is not ramped; instead it         uses one constant frequency, the Track Synthesizer Frequency         (TSF), which is an average frequency for the entire pass.          The closed-loop receiver AGC loop can be configured to one         of three settings: narrow, medium, or wide.  It will be         configured such that the expected amplitude changes are         accommodated with minimum distortion.  The loop bandwidth         (2BLo) will be configured such that the expected phase         changes can be accommodated while maintaining the best         possible loop SNR.          Open-Loop Receivers (OLR):  The OLR utilized a fixed first         Local Oscillator (LO) frequency and a tunable second LO         frequency to minimize phase noise and improve frequency         stability.  The OLR consisted of an RF-to-IF downconverter         located at the feed , an IF selection switch (IFS), and a         Radio Science Receiver (RSR).  The RF-IF downconverters         in the 70-m antennas were equipped for four IF channels:         S-RCP, S-LCP, X-RCP, and X-LCP.  The 34-m HEF stations         were equipped with a two-channel RF-IF: S-band and X-band.         The IFS switched the IF input among the antennas.         DSCC Transmitter Subsystem       --------------------------         The Transmitter Subsystem accepts the S-band frequency         exciter signal from the Receiver-Exciter Subsystem exciter         and amplifies it to the required transmit output level.  The         amplified signal is routed via the diplexer through the feed         horn to the antenna and then focused and beamed to the         spacecraft.          The Transmitter Subsystem power capabilities range from 18 kW         to 400 kW.  Power levels above 18 kW are available only at         70-m stations, however, 80 kW transmitters are being installed         at the 34-m stations.          The Ka-band Transmitter at DSS-25 transmits at 300 W using         two combined Traveling Wave Tube Amplifiers (TWTAs).         DSCC Tracking Subsystem       -----------------------         The Tracking Subsystem primary functions are to acquire and         maintain communications with the spacecraft and to generate         and format radiometric data containing Doppler and range.          The DSCC Tracking Subsystem (DTK) receives the carrier         signals and ranging spectra from the Receiver-Exciter         Subsystem.  The Doppler cycle counts are counted, formatted,         and transmitted to JPL in real time.  Ranging data are also         transmitted to JPL in real time.  Also contained in these         blocks is the AGC information from the Receiver-Exciter         Subsystem.  The Radio Metric Data Conditioning Team (RMDCT)         at JPL produces a Tracking and Navigation Service File (TNF),         which contains Doppler and ranging data.          In addition, the Tracking Subsystem receives from the CMC         frequency predicts (used to compute frequency residuals and         noise estimates), receiver tuning predicts (used to tune the         closed-loop receivers), and uplink tuning predicts (used to         tune the exciter).  From the LMC, it receives configuration         and control directives as well as configuration and status         information on the transmitter, microwave, and frequency and         timing subsystems.          The Metric Data Assembly (MDA) controls all of the DTK         functions supporting the uplink and downlink activities.  The         MDA receives uplink predicts and controls the uplink tuning         by commanding the DCO.  The MDA also controls the Sequential         Ranging Assembly (SRA).  It formats the Doppler and range         measurements and provides them to the GCF for transmission to         NOCC.          The Sequential Ranging Assembly (SRA) measures the round trip         light time (RTLT) of a radio signal traveling from a ground         tracking station to a spacecraft and back.  From the RTLT,         phase, and Doppler data, the spacecraft range can be         determined.  A coded signal is modulated on an uplink carrier         and transmitted to the spacecraft where it is detected and         transponded back to the ground station.  As a result, the         signal received at the tracking station is delayed by its         round trip through space and shifted in frequency by the         Doppler effect due to the relative motion between the         spacecraft and the tracking station on Earth.         DSCC Frequency and Timing Subsystem       -----------------------------------         The Frequency and Timing Subsystem (FTS) provides all         frequency and timing references required by the other DSCC         subsystems.  It contains four frequency standards of which         one is prime and the other three are backups.  Selection of         the prime standard is done via the CMC.  Of these four         standards, two are hydrogen masers followed by clean-up loops         (CUL) and two are cesium standards.  These four standards all         feed the Coherent Reference Generator (CRG) which provides         the frequency references used by the rest of the complex.  It         also provides the frequency reference to the Master Clock         Assembly (MCA) which in turn provides time to the Time         Insertion and Distribution Assembly (TID) which provides UTC         and SIM-time to the complex.          JPL's ability to monitor the FTS at each DSCC is limited to         the MDA calculated Doppler pseudo-residuals, the Doppler         noise, the SSI, and to a system which uses the Global         Positioning System (GPS).  GPS receivers at each DSCC receive         a one-pulse-per-second pulse from the station's (hydrogen         maser referenced) FTS and a pulse from a GPS satellite at         scheduled times.  After compensating for the satellite signal         delay, the timing offset is reported to JPL where a database         is kept.  The clock offsets stored in the JPL database are         given in microseconds; each entry is a mean reading of         measurements from several GPS satellites and a time tag         associated with the mean reading.  The clock offsets provided         include those of SPC 10 relative to UTC (NIST), SPC 40         relative to SPC 10, etc.      Detectors - DSN     ===============       Nominal carrier tracking loop threshold noise bandwidth at       X-band is 10 Hz.  Coherent (two-way) closed-loop       system stability is shown in the table below:              integration time            Doppler uncertainty                  (secs)               (one sigma, microns/sec)                  ------               ------------------------                     10                            50                     60                            20                   1000                             4        For the open-loop subsystem, signal detection is done in       software.

Chopping or tilting of the secondary mirror is performed to cancel   sky radiation and nodding of the telescope is performed to cancel   the radiation contribution from the telescope.  The chop-nod   method for the LWS uses nod and chop throws of equal amplitudes   but in opposite directions. The result is that for each nod   position, one of the chop beams is in the same x-y location on the   detector. The resulting image, after applying a double difference   process, requires no further shift or add processing.  Data Acquisition ================   The data acquisition system for the LWS allows the user to choose   the save-to-disk frequency (maximum 5 Hz) and the total   integration time. The save frequency and the integration time   determine the number of chop sets, also called save sets, and the   number of nod sets. These sets are saved as six-dimensional FITS   files:        FITS       NAXIS  Definition       -----  -------------------------------------------------------         1    The number of image columns (X)         2    The number of image rows (Y)         3    The number of chop beams         4    The number of chop frame pairs saved per nod         5    The number of nod beams         6    The number of final chop-nod sets    An illustration of the timing of data acquisition and the ordering   of chop-nod frames within a six-dimensional FITS file is provided   in the DOCUMENT/LWS_FITS.JPG file.    Software   --------     Before reducing LWS data, the six dimensions of a raw FITS image     must be properly combined into a co-added, chop-nod, two-     dimensional image.  Software to aid this process is available     from the Keck website for the Infrared Reduction and Analysis     Facility (IRAF) or for the Interactive Data Language (IDL):         http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/inst/lws/wmkolws.html (IRAF)        http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/inst/lws/lws-idl.html (IDL)      Once an image is converted to a two-dimensional array, standard     optical or infrared processing packages can be used for further     reductions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:keck.10m_keck2.echelle,Keck Echelle Spectrograph and Imager,Keck Echelle Spectrograph and Imager,"The following information was extracted from the ''ESI: Echelle    spectrograph and Imager'' user's manual available from the Keck II web site, at this URL (as of this writing):                                                                                               http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/inst/esi/ESI_Manual.html                                                                              Sections of the content of this manual website are reproduced with the kind permission of Keck Observatory.                             Keck's Echelle Spectrograph and Imager (ESI) has three modes.    In the echelle mode, there are ten orders on the CCD with complete wavelength coverage from 3900 Angstroms to 10900  Angstroms.  The dispersion in Angstroms/pixel varies from order to order, as does the spatial scale along the slit. The bluest order (15) has a linear dispersion of ~0.15 Angstroms/pixel and the dispersion increases moving towards the red (lower order number), inversely by the order number, up to 0.30 Angstroms/pixel (order 6).  The scale in the dispersion direction is 0.154 arcsec/pixel; 1 arcsec projects to 6.5 pixels.  The velocity dispersion is a nearly constant 11.5 km/s/pixel in all orders. Slits are 20 arcseconds in length and are available with widths of 0.3, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25 and 6.0 arcseconds. A one arcsecond wide slit projects to 6.5 pixels (0.154 arcsec/pixel).  The free spectral range of every order listed falls completely on the detector. The bluer orders contain significant amounts of data outside the free spectral range as well.  The low-resolution mode of ESI uses only the prisms for dispersion, and has multi-slit capability.  The dispersion varies roughly linearly from 0.8 Angstroms/pixel (60 km/sec/pixel) at 3900  Angstroms, to 11 Angstroms/pixel (300 km/sec/pixel) at 11,000 Angstroms. The slit length is approximately 8 arcminutes, and 0.3, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25, and 6.0 arcsecond wide slits are available.  There is no need for order separation.  Since the dispersion is done by prisms, there are no higher order spectra as there are with gratings or grisms.  The direct imaging mode of ESI has the prisms out of the beam and an imaging mirror in place.  In this mode, ESI delivers an 8 x 2 arcminute direct field.  The facility BVRI filters originally delivered are undersized with a field of 3.5 x 2.5 arcminutes.  The filters have been placed to allow the undersized facility filters to illuminate part of the CCD which is not affected by bad columns and is also more or less parallel to the rows and columns of the CCD. The unvignetted field is 2' x 8' with good images over the full field.  R. Ellis has kindly donated a full-field R filter which is also available.  During commissioning, images as good as 0.34"" FWHM were obtained.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two of these have a vacuum spectrograph beneath them, one of 18 meter deep and the other 4 meter deep with lower resolution but higher light             throughput. These two spectrographs are able to rotate to compensate for the rotation of the image caused by the use of a heliostat.              The third position can only be equipped with a static optical table with no image rotation correction and is therefore rarely used.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:kpno.boller1m3.kpsc,KPNO Single Channel Polarimeter,KPNO Single Channel Polarimeter,"The Single-channel Polarimeter was put into service for the Kitt Peak 36- and 50-inch telescopes in August 1969.  It is similar to one built at the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory (Shakhovskoy and Dymov 1962).  The main element of the device is a rapidly rotating polarizer mounted in a circular disk containing 100 radial slots spaced uniformly around the perimeter.  The disk serves to encode the angular position of the polarizer.  A star-chopping technique is used to compensate for sky brightness by means of a pair of closely matched diaphragms in the focal plane.  The remainder of the polarimeter includes a moveable filter slide immediately following the polarizer, and then a Lyot depolarizer.  The final optical element is a CuSO4-5H2O crystal in a moveable slide which is used to eliminate red leaks from the shorter-wavelength filters.  The observing procedure is to place a star in one diaphragm with an area of adjacent sky in the other.  Small systematic differences between the two beams are eliminated by periodically switching the star from one diaphragm to the other during an observation.  The observer is aided by an oscilloscope display of the accumulated intensity as a function of polarizer position angle.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:lidar.phx,"METEOROLOGY SUITE, LIDAR for PHX","METEOROLOGY SUITE, LIDAR","The Phoenix mission to Mars will advance our knowledge of the climate on Mars by combining lidar remote sensing of atmospheric dust and clouds with measurements of solar radiation and in situ sampling of temperature, pressure, wind, and water vapour. The day to day variation of the local weather on Mars is controlled primarily by the amount of solar radiation reaching the surface and this depends on the optical thickness of the dust suspended in the atmosphere. This affects local and global meteorological patterns which in turn determine the lifting of dust from the surface and long range transport. There is also a climate interaction with the distribution of water ice above and below the surface of Mars. This involves transport of water through the atmosphere and previous lidar measurements from orbit have indicated that clouds could have a substantial role. The lidar on the Phoenix mission will record the height profile of laser backscatter from the dust and cloud layers that drift past the landing site with a view that is continuous in time. The attenuation of the lidar signal can be used to derive the optical extinction coefficient and this is related to atmospheric properties. For example, the extinction of solar radiation due to dust has a first order effect on heating of the surface of Mars. The measured optical extinction can also be related to the amount of scattering material. For example, for a thin cloud the extinction coefficient measured by a lidar can be used to derive the ice water content within the cloud. Such a measurement will be of vital importance to the mission goal to investigate water on Mars. The combination of the lidar and passive remote sensing with in situ sampling will provide a view of the interacting processes that determine the local weather at the surface and also the role of the atmosphere in the water cycle on Mars. A basic atmospheric lidar (light detection and ranging) emits pulses of laser light into the atmosphere then detects and records the backscattered light as a function of time. The time resolved signal is converted to distance using the speed of light and a factor of two to account for the round-trip path length. The lidar transmitter is based on a diode pumped, passively Q-switched, neodymium-doped yttrium garnet (Nd:YAG) laser. This configuration was chosen for its robustness and technological maturity as much as for its suitable lidar performance. The pump diode array emits at a wavelength of 808 nm and is used to provide the energy to the Nd:YAG crystal within the laser cavity. Lasing is inhibited within the cavity through the use of a saturable absorber. The photon density within the oscillator cavity builds to a level where the saturable absorber bleaches and the energy within the cavity is dumped as a laser pulse over a very short time (a passive Q-switch). For this laser the output light pulse has a length of approximately 10 ns and an energy of 0.7 mJ. After the laser cavity emits its light pulse, part of the optical energy is converted from a wavelength of 1064 nm to 532 nm by second harmonic generation in a Potassium Titanyl Phosphate (KTP) crystal. The laser output is then expanded by a factor of 10 in order to reduce the divergence to 0.5 mrad. A small fraction of the outgoing laser pulse is 'picked off' and separated into the two wavelength components in order to measure the relative amplitude of each wavelength with photodiodes. The signal from the photodiode detecting the 1064 nm pulse is used to trigger the data acquisition electronics, providing a zero-time reference, and also to shut off the pumping diodes.The atmospheric backscatter signals are collected by an afocal reflective telescope and split into the two relevant wavelengths using dichroic mirrors. The 1064 nm backscatter is detected by an Avalanche Photo-Diode (APD), and recorded using 14-bit analog to digital conversion (ADC). The 532 nm backscatter is detected by a Photomultiplier (PMT) and the signal is recorded using both ADC and photon counting. Photon counting is required to record the weak signals from heights above 5 km and up to 20 km.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are covered by thin,   Al-coated polypropylene foils to exclude sunlight. The sensors have a   spectral resolution of about 100 KeV at 5.5 MeV.  The combined   field-of-view for the 5 sensor pairs is nearly 3-pi steradians, with   the only blind spot being in the direction of the spacecraft bus. The   APS has a mass of 4 kg and uses about 7 w of power [BINDERETAL1998].       Science Objectives   ==================     A major science objective of the Alpha Particle Spectrometer is   measure the number and distribution of transient lunar outgassing   events and their role as sources of the tenuous lunar atmosphere. The   experiment will investigate possible correlations of outgassing   events with locations of young impact craters and tectonic features.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:lp.eng,LP ENGINEERING for LP,LP ENGINEERING,"     Instrument Overview   ===================    The Lunar Prospector Engineering 'instrument' consists of the    spacecraft attitude control system (ACS), the command and data    handling (CDH) subsystem, and the communications subsystem (COM).    Various data products from each of the systems have been included in    the archive of the NASA level 0 data [BINDERETAL1998].       Science Objectives   ==================     The engineering systems support science rather than acquire science     data. The individual systems were designed to meet the accuracy     requirements of the science payload.       Platform Mounting Descriptions   ==============================     The communications antenna is mounted along the spacecraft spin axis     (+Z). The sun pulse and limb crossing sensor mounting locations were     not provided to the archive.       Operational Considerations   ==========================     The instantaneous spin rate varies as the spacecraft passes into and     out of the Moon's shadow and after each spacecraft maneuver. When the     spacecraft is in eclipse, the sun pulse is estimated using the     pre-eclipse measured spin rate, the calibrated spin rate change     during eclipse, and limb sensor telemetry.     Operation and Sampling Modes   ============================     The communication system consists of an S-band transponder, an omni     antenna with 3-pi steradian antenna pattern for uplink and downlink,     and a medium gain antenna for downlink.  The engineering-only     downlink data rate is 300 bps and the science/engineering downlink     data rate is 3600 bps.       Command and control of the spacecraft is achieved by a simple Command     and Data Handling (C&DH) unit.  As an individual command is uplinked     to the spacecraft, the C&DH directs the command to the appropriate     subsystem.  All science and engineering data are collected by the     C&DH and then are buffered and formatted for downlink by the C&DH.     The data are downlinked at 1800 bps immediately and simultaneously     dumped into a solid state recorder.  The data stored on the solid     state recorder is downlinked 53 minutes later.  These delayed data     frames are interleaved into the real-time data stream, yielding a     total downlink rate of 3600 bps.  The purpose of the delayed stream     is to receive data acquired during communications blackout periods     and to eliminate the need for a commandable data recorder.       The ACS system consists of sun and limb crossing sensors. The data     from these sensors is used to determine the spacecraft attitude and     spin rate.       Principal Investigator   ======================     The LP science team consists of the PI, Alan Binder and six Co-I's,     and is divided into three groups.  The Spectrometer Group consists of     William Feldman, Binder, and G. Scott Hubbard.  The Magnetics Group     consists of Robert Lin, Mario Acuna, and Lon Hood.  The Gravity Group     consists of Alexander Konopliv.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:lp.er,ELECTRON REFLECTOMETER for LP,ELECTRON REFLECTOMETER,"       Instrument Overview   ===================     The Lunar Prospector Electron Reflectometer (ER) instrument is based     on the instrument flown on the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft     [ACUNAETAL1992].  Some changes were made to the Lunar Prospector     version to account for the spinning spacecraft.  The ER     instrumentation consists of a symmetric hemispherical electrostatic     analyzer and an electronics box.  The electronics box is common to     the ER and its companion instrument, the Magnetometer (MAG).  The ER     has a 360 degree disk-shaped field-of-view.  The electrostatic     optics select energy and focus the particles onto an imaging     detector. The ER sensor is a 12 cm diameter cylinder, 9 cm high.       The combined mass of the Magnetometer and Electron Reflectometer is     about 5 kg, and the two instruments together use about 4.5 w of     power.       Scientific Objectives   ====================     The Magnetometer/Electron Reflectometer (MAG/ER) experiment will     investigate the origin and nature of lunar crustal magnetic fields     and constrain the size of a metallic core.  The experiment also will     provide global maps of the lunar crustal magnetic fields and provide     estimates of the lunar induced magnetic dipole moment     [BINDERETAL1998].       Operational Considerations   ==========================     The ER unit maintains its temperature using thermal blanketing,     surface finishes, and its internal power dissipation.       The magnetic fields measured by the ER will be a combination of the     Earth's magnetic field, the field carried from the Sun by the solar     wind, and the Moon's field, which is extremely weak.  The magnetic     field at the lunar surface also is affected by local deposits of     magnetic material.       Detector Mounting Descriptions   ==============================     The ER and electronics box are mounted at the ends of a small cross     bar on the MAG/ER boom, about 1 m inboard from the MAG.  (The MAG is     on the end of the same boom, about 2.6 m away from the spacecraft     bus.)  The ER unit is mounted so that its field-of-view includes the     spin axis and is perpendicular to the boom.  The only blockage of     the ER field-of-view is the boom itself.       The ER can measure magnetic fields as weak as one-millionth of the     strength of the Earth's magnetic field.       Principal Investigator   ======================     The Co-I and magnetics group leader for the Lunar Prospector     Magnetometer and Electron Reflector experiment is Dr. Robert Lin of     the University of California, Berkeley.

The Lunar Prospector Gamma Ray Spectrometer (GRS) sensor consists of a 7.1 cm diameter by 7.6 cm long bismuth germanate (BGO) crystal, placed within a 12 cm diameter by 20 cm long, borated-plastic anticoincidence shield (ACS).  Both scintillators are viewed by separate photomultiplier tubes, and enclosed in a cylindrical, graphite-epoxy housing.  The GRS has a mass of 8.6 kg and uses about 3 w of power [BINDERETAL1998].   Science Objectives ==================   The GRS will estimate the global surface abundances of key elements (U, Th, K, O, Si, Mg, Fe, Ti, Ca, Al, and H).  The GRS will provide new constraints on the bulk composition of the crust, on compositional variations over the lunar surface, and on the existence of lunar resources.  The GRS will investigate how large-scale impacts and volcanism have modified the structure and surface composition of the lunar crust.   Platform Mounting Descriptions ==============================   The Gamma Ray Spectrometer is mounted on one of the three Lunar Prospector booms.   Operational Considerations ==========================   The sensor housing is wrapped with a thermostat controlled heater within a thermal blanket that will provide a stable operational environment of -28 deg C for at least 1.5 years.  The ACS functions to tag penetrating charged-particle events from the gamma ray spectrum and to tag gamma rays that escape from the BGO.  The ACS also detects neutrons using the boron content of the shield.   Operation and Sampling Modes ============================   The Gamma Ray Spectrometer is designed to operate continuously during the Lunar Prospector Primary Mission.  It acquires a spectrum every 32 seconds.  The gamma ray energy range of the instrument covers 0.3 to 9 MeV with a sampling resolution of 17.6 keV.  The Lunar Prospector GRS, as a function of energy, is 2 to 8 times more sensitive than the Apollo gamma ray spectrometer.   Principal Investigator ======================   The Co-I and spectrometer group leader for the Lunar Prospector Gamma Ray Spectrometer experiment is Dr. William Feldman of Los Alamos National Laboratory.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:lp.mager,MAGNETOMETER - ELECTRON REFLECTOMETER for LP,MAGNETOMETER - ELECTRON REFLECTOMETER,"     Instrument Overview   ===================   The Lunar Prospector Magnetometer and Electron Reflectometer (MAGER)   instruments are based on the instruments flown on the Mars Global   Surveyor spacecraft [ACUNAETAL1992].  Some changes were made to the   Lunar Prospector versions to account for the spinning spacecraft.   Also, there is only one magnetometer sensor on Lunar Prospector.  The   instrumentation consists of a 3-axis fluxgate magnetometer, a   symmetric hemispherical electrostatic analyzer, and their common   electronics box. The magnetometer (MAG) sensor is a wide-range (up to   +/- 65,536 nT), low noise (6 pT RMS), high sensitivity (as low as +/-   2 pT), triaxial fluxgate magnetometer.  The MAG sensor is an 11 x 6.5   x 9 cm box.  The electron reflectometer (ER) has a 360 degree   disk-shaped field-of-view. The electrostatic optics select energy and   focus the particles onto an imaging detector.  The ER sensor is a 12   cm diameter cylinder, 9 cm high.     The combined mass of the Magnetometer and Electron Reflectometer is   about 5 kg, and the two instruments use about 4.5 w of power.       Science Objectives   ==================   The MAG/ER experiment will investigate the origin and nature of lunar   crustal magnetic fields and constrain the size of a metallic core.   The experiment will also provide global maps of the lunar crustal   magnetic fields and provide estimates of the lunar induced magnetic   dipole moment [BINDERETAL1998].       Platform Mounting Descriptions   ==============================   The MAG sensor is mounted at the end of the MAG/ER boom about 2.6 m   away from the spacecraft bus.  The ER and electronics box are mounted   at the ends of a small cross bar, about 1 m inboard from the MAG. The   ER unit is mounted so that its field-of-view includes the spin axis   and is perpendicular to the boom.  The only blockage of the ER   field-of-view is the boom itself.       Operational Considerations   ==========================   The MAG sensor uses a combination of thermal blanketing and heaters   to maintain its operating temperature.  The ER unit maintains its   temperature using thermal blanketing, surface finishes, and its   internal power dissipation.     The magnetic fields measured by the MAG will be a combination of the   Earth's magnetic field, the field carried from the Sun by the solar   wind, and the Moon's field, which is extremely weak.  The magnetic   field at the lunar surface is also affected by local deposits of   magnetic material.     The ER can measure magnetic fields as weak as one-millionth of the   strength of the Earth's magnetic field.       Operation and Sampling Modes   ============================   The magnetometer data are sampled 16 times a second, synchronous with   the telemetry clock.  Data are compressed by delta-modulation to   6-bits per axis per channel.  Occasional full samples (12 bits per   axis plus range) are collected.       Principal Investigator   ======================   The Co-I and magnetics group leader for the Lunar Prospector   Magnetometer and Electron Reflector experiment is Dr. Robert Lin of   the University of California, Berkeley.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:lp.ns,NEUTRON SPECTROMETER for LP,NEUTRON SPECTROMETER,"   Instrument Overview ===================   A detailed description of the Lunar Prospector Neutron Spectrometer is given in the article The Lunar Prospector gamma-ray and neutron spectrometers, W. C. Feldman et al., Nuc. Inst. and Meth. A, 422, 562, 1999 [FELDMANETAL1999A]. For details not found herein, the reader is referred to this article.   The Lunar Prospector Neutron Spectrometer (NS) consists of two identical 5 cm diameter by 20 cm long helium-3 filled gas proportional counters.  One counter is covered with a 0.75 mm thick Cd shield, and is only sensitive to epithermal neutrons having energies above 0.25 eV.  The second counter is covered with a 0.75 mm thick Sn shield and is sensitive to both thermal and epithermal neutrons.  The difference in counting rates between the two counters is a measure of the flux of thermal neutrons with energies between 0 and 0.25 eV.  Fast neutrons will be measured using the ACS of the Gamma Ray Spectrometer. The NS has a mass of 3.9 kg and uses about 2.5 w of power [BINDERETAL1998].   Science Objectives ==================   A major science objective of the Neutron Spectrometer is to search for the existence of water ice located in permanently shadowed areas near the lunar poles.  This requires separate measurements of thermal, epithermal, and fast neutrons from the lunar surface [FELDMANETAL1991].   Platform Mounting Descriptions ==============================   The NS is mounted on one of the three Lunar Prospector booms. The Neutron Spectrometer is mounted on a chassis that is shared with the Alpha Particle Spectrometer.   Operational Considerations ==========================   Maps of hydrogen near the surface should be possible after 1 month of observations at the poles and elsewhere after 6 months of data collection.   Operation and Sampling Modes ============================   The Neutron Spectrometer is designed to operate continuously during the Lunar Prospector Primary Mission.   Principal Investigator ======================   The Co-I and spectrometer group leader for the Lunar Prospector Neutron Spectrometer experiment is Dr. William Feldman of Los Alamos National Laboratory.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:lp.rss,RADIO SCIENCE SUBSYSTEM for LP,RADIO SCIENCE SUBSYSTEM,"     Instrument Overview   ===================     The Lunar Prospector Radio Science investigations utilized     instrumentation with elements on the spacecraft and at the DSN.     Much of this was shared equipment, being used for routine     telecommunications as well as for Radio Science.  The     performance and calibration of both the spacecraft and tracking     stations directly affected the radio science data accuracy, and     played a major role in determining the quality of the results.     The spacecraft part of the radio science instrument is     described immediately below; that is followed by a description     of the DSN (ground) part of the instrument.  More information     on the Lunar Prospector radio science instrument and     communication subsystem can be found in the Lunar Prospector     Mission Handbook [ANDOLZ1998].       Instrument Overview - Spacecraft   ================================       Communications System Overview     ------------------------------       The Lunar Prospector communication system provides a       scientific data and telemetry link between the satellite and       the ground.  Scientific data, health and status signals are       transmitted at 2273.0 MHz over a +/- 1 MHz bandwidth with       nominal power of 5 Watts and peak power of 7 Watts.  The       radiated signal is right-hand circularly polarized (RCP).       The command link is received at 2093.0542 MHz over a +/- 1       MHz bandwidth.         S-Band Transponder     ------------------       The Loral/Conic S-Band transponder is a standard, off the       shelf, S-Band transponder that combines the receiver and       transmitter into one unit.  The S-band transponder supports       the essential communications functions needed for tracking,       telemetry, and command of Lunar Prospector.  The transponder       receives commands from the ground station along with signals       inserted on the uplink for ranging purposes and transmits       scientific data and telemetry from the spacecraft to the       ground.         The receiver/detector section of the transponder detects       S-band uplink signals, demodulates the 250 bps lunar command       signal, and outputs it as binary command data and bit timing       to command and data handling.  Ranging signals are also       demodulated and remodulated onto the downlink carrier to       provide range information to ground equipment when desired.       Ranging can be commanded ON or OFF.         The transmitter/baseband section of the transponder receives       data from the Command And Data Handling (C&DH) electronics at       a rate of 300 bps or 3600 bps, converts it from NRZ-L to       NRZ-M format and then applies rate 1/2, k=7 convolutional       encoding for error protection when convolutional encoding is       enabled.  The encoded data BPSK modulates an internal 1.024       MHz subcarrier which in turn phase modulates the downlink       carrier for transmission to the ground station.       Convolutional encoding can be commanded ON or OFF.         Antenna System Overview     -----------------------       The Lunar Prospector antennas provide scientific data and       telemetry links between the satellite and the ground.  Both       antennas transmit and receive RCP over their main beams.         The antenna used to complete the command and initial       telemetry link is a conical spiral.  This antenna has an       omnidirectional pattern from 0 to over 100 degrees from       the +z (spin) axis of the spacecraft.  A gain of better than       -1 dBi is achieved to angles 60 degrees from the +z axis,       -3 dBi to angles 90 degrees from the +z axis, and -5 dBi to       angles 100 degrees from the +z axis.  Spacecraft obstructions       are not a factor until 148 degrees, where the antenna gain is       approximately -15 dBi.         Once LP reached lunar orbit, the scientific data and       telemetry were transmitted by a medium gain antenna --       a bifilar helix wrapped around a metal core.  The       structural loads on the helix are eliminated by       enclosing it in a radome/support structure.  This also       supports the omni antenna on the top of the structure.       The medium gain antenna beam is a fan extending from       85 to 95 degrees from the +z (spin) axis of the spacecraft.       For the 90 degree roll cut the maximum gain is 8.5 dBi and       the minimum gain is 6.85 dBi.  The average gain is 7.75 dBi       and the phase ripple is 13 degrees.         Antenna Selector Switch     -----------------------       Under normal operating conditions, two way communications can       be maintained between Lunar Prospector and a ground station       having an 18-meter antenna using just the omnidirectional       antenna, so long as the earth is within view of the       spacecraft.         Switching from the omni to the helix antenna (and vice versa,       since the switch latches in the last commanded position) must       be commanded from the ground.  Switching the transmitter to       the medium gain helix increases the margin, but is not       necessary to support the Lunar Prospector mission.  The two       commands, Transmitter to MGA and Transmitter to Omni, are       used to connect the transmitter to the helix (medium gain       antenna) and the Omni (low gain antenna) respectively.  The       antenna switch is a break-before-make switch specified to be       capable of handling at least 5W RF power without any       indication of corona or voltage breakdown.  The switch can       sustain at least 50,000 switching cycles for a period in       excess of two years on-orbit operation.         Communications Telemetry     ------------------------       Telemetry is available from the S-band transponder and the       antenna selector switch to enable operators to monitor the       state of these devices.         Received signal strength, receiver voltage, loop stress,       transmitter voltage, transmitter output power, and       transmitter temperature are analog signals; carrier lock       status, transmitter on/off, coherent on/off, subcarrier       oscillator on/off, convolutional encoding on/off and ranging       on/off are discrete signals provided by the transponder.         The antenna selector switch also provides a discrete       indication of switch position.  The transmitter output power       is monitored with a circuit that couples a sample of the RF       output and conditions it to produce a 0 to 5 Vdc output.       Science Objectives   ==================     The radio science experiment that was conducted with Lunar     Prospector was a radio tracking experiment in which the     magnitude and direction of the planet's gravity field were     derived from the Doppler (and, sometimes, ranging)     measurements.         Gravity Measurements     --------------------       Measurement of the gravity field provides significant       constraints on inferences about the interior structure of the       moon.  Precise, detailed study of the spacecraft motion in       lunar orbit can yield the mass distribution of the planet.       Lunar topographic data (e.g.  Clementine data) forms a       critical adjunct to these measurements since only after the       gravitational effects are adjusted for topography can the       gravity anomalies be interpreted geophysically.         Studies of the gravity field emphasize both the global field       and local characteristics of the field.  The first task is to       determine the global field.  Doppler and range tracking       measurements yield accurate spacecraft trajectory solutions.       Simultaneously with reconstruction of the spacecraft orbit,       observation equations for field coefficients and a small       number of ancillary parameters can be solved.  This type of       gravity field solution is essential for characterizing       tectonic phenomena and can also be used to study localized       features.         'Short-arc' line-of-sight (LOS) Doppler tracking measurements       obtained when the Earth-to-spacecraft line-of-sight is within       a few degrees of the orbit plane provide the highest       resolution of local features.  The results from this type of       observation typically are presented as contoured acceleration       profiles of specific features (e.g., craters, volcanoes,       etc.) or line-of-sight acceleration maps of specific regions.       The high spatial resolution of these products makes them       especially useful to geophysicists for study of features in       the size range of 30 to 1,000 km.  Because of the relative       simplicity of the data analysis, results can be available       within a few weeks after the data are collected.  However,       more accurate LOS results can be obtained by referencing the       LOS accelerations with respect to a gravity model.  This       removes biases in the LOS accelerations that would normally       be there as a result of spacecraft orbit error.  With this       approach, delivery of the LOS data follows development and       delivery of the gravity model.       Operational Considerations - Spacecraft   =======================================       Receiver Performance     --------------------       The receiver section of the Lunar Prospector transponder is a       dual-conversion, superhetrodyne design that down-converts the       RF uplink carrier to a 2nd IF frequency (18.3 MHz) for       baseband processing by the acquisition circuitry of the       detector assembly.  The receiver is followed by a detector       assembly that locks a local VCXO to the signal and outputs       detected ranging, telecommand, and telemetry outputs.         The transponder receiver can acquire an uplink carrier with       center frequency 2093.0542 MHz +/- 150 KHz, within 1 minute       after turn-on.  Recent tests showed the transponder acquired       and maintained lock approximately +/- 280 kHz about the       center frequency, which is well beyond the end of life (EOL)       requirements.  The unit is designed to perform as specified       for any signal between -125 dBm and -40 dBm, a dynamic range       of 85 dBm.  Following removal of an RF input of + 3 dBm, the       receiver will perform as specified within 10 seconds.         At -20 degrees Celsius , the best lock frequency averaged       2093.0655 MHz +/- 3.232 kHz, as contrasted to 2093.0216 +/-       3.718 kHz at + 65 degrees Celsius.  Unfortunately       insufficient data is available to reliably fit a curve       between the extremes.  The two available data points suggest       there is little change between -20 and +25 degrees Celsius.       Frequency at turn-on is expected to be close to the 2093.0655       MHz value.         The receiver is capable of acquiring and tracking an RF       signal over a +/- 90 KHz search range in less than or equal       to 17.5 seconds when the unmodulated signal level is greater       than or equal to -125 dBm.  During recent tests, the       transponder acquisition threshold was -131 dBm, exceeding the       EOL requirement.  The uplink command threshold, measured at       -131 dBm also exceeds EOL requirements.  The transponder can       track modulated or unmodulated carriers with a maximum       doppler rate of 600 Hz/sec.         Transponder range delay, measured at approximately 1350 nsec,       more than meets the requirement to not exceed 1500 nsec.         Transmitter Performance     -----------------------       The transmitter is designed to provide a nominal RF output of       5 watts by end of life.  Telemetry data is converted from       NRZ-L to NRZ-M form and then, if so commanded, rate 1/2       convolutionally encoded prior to being BPSK modulated onto       the 1.024 MHz subcarrier for downlinking, with or without       turnaround ranging signals.  The resulting signal is linearly       phase modulated onto the downlink RF carrier.  Turning off       the subcarrier will result in loss of downlink data.         In noncoherent mode, the transmit frequency of 2273 MHz is       determined by an internal crystal oscillator.  The oscillator       stability is +/- 25 ppm at 1 year and +/- 30 ppm at 3 years       following acceptance test for the transponder.  In coherent       mode, the transmitter frequency is derived from the received       carrier VCXO signal by the ratio 240/221.         Restrictions and Constraints     ----------------------------       The main constraint of the communication system is keeping       the orientation of the communication cone toward earth.       Calibration Description - Spacecraft   ====================================     No information available.       Principal Investigators   =======================     The Principal Investigator for the gravity investigation was     Alexander S. Konopliv.       Instrument Section / Operating Mode Descriptions - Spacecraft   =============================================================     The transponder can be operated in either a noncoherent or     coherent mode to support range rate determination.  In the     former case, the downlink carrier is derived from an onboard     oscillator that is tuned to the assigned downlink frequency; in     the latter case, the downlink carrier frequency is locked to     the uplink frequency at ratio of 240/221.  Coherent operation     can be commanded ON or OFF.       Lunar Prospector transmitter output power is greater than or     equal to 5 Watts over the life of the mission.  Using the     omnidirectional antenna, 5W is sufficient to close the downlink     with more than 3 dB margin for data transmitted at a 3600 bps     rate.  When enabled, rate 1/2 convolutional encoding increases     the physical symbol rate to 7200 sps on the downlink.       Instrument Overview - DSN   =========================     Three Deep Space Communications Complexes (DSCCs) (near     Barstow, CA; Canberra, Australia; and Madrid, Spain) comprise     the DSN tracking network.  Each complex is equipped with     several antennas [including at least one each 70-m, 34-m High     Efficiency (HEF), and 34-m standard (STD)], associated     electronics, and operational systems.  Primary activity at each     complex is radiation of commands to and reception of telemetry     data from active spacecraft.  Transmission and reception is     possible in several radio-frequency bands, the most common     being S-band (nominally a frequency of 2100-2300 MHz or a     wavelength of 14.2-13.0 cm) and X-band (7100-8500 MHz or 4.2-     3.5 cm).  Transmitter output powers of up to 400 kw are     available.       Ground stations have the ability to transmit coded and uncoded     waveforms which can be echoed by distant spacecraft.  Analysis     of the received coding allows navigators to determine the     distance to the spacecraft; analysis of Doppler shift on the     carrier signal allows estimation of the line-of-sight     spacecraft velocity.  Range and Doppler measurements are used     to calculate the spacecraft trajectory and to infer gravity     fields of objects near the spacecraft.       Ground stations can record spacecraft signals that have     propagated through or been scattered from target media.     Measurements of signal parameters after wave interactions with     surfaces, atmospheres, rings, and plasmas are used to infer     physical and electrical properties of the target.       Principal investigators vary from experiment to experiment.     See the corresponding section of the spacecraft instrument     description or the data set description for specifics.       The Deep Space Network is managed by the Jet Propulsion     Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology for the     U.S.  National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

Subsystems - DSN   ================     The Deep Space Communications Complexes (DSCCs) are an integral     part of the Radio Science instrument, along with other     receiving stations and the spacecraft Radio Frequency     Subsystem.  Their system performance directly determines the     degree of success of Radio Science investigations, and their     system calibration determines the degree of accuracy in the     results of the experiments.  The following paragraphs describe     the functions performed by the individual subsystems of a DSCC.     This material has been adapted from [ASMAR&HERRERA1993]; for     additional information, consult [DSN810-5].       Each DSCC includes a set of antennas, a Signal Processing     Center (SPC), and communication links to the Jet Propulsion     Laboratory (JPL).  The general configuration is illustrated     below; antennas (Deep Space Stations, or DSS -- a term carried     over from earlier times when antennas were individually     instrumented) are listed in the table.             --------   --------   --------   --------   --------          | DSS 12 | | DSS 18 | | DSS 14 | | DSS 15 | | DSS 16 |          |34-m STD| |34-m STD| |  70-m  | |34-m HEF| |  26-m  |           --------   --------   --------   --------   --------               |            |     |             |          |               |            v     v             |          v               |           ---------            |     ---------                --------->|GOLDSTONE|<----------     |EARTH/ORB|                          | SPC  10 |<-------------->|   LINK  |                           ---------                  ---------                          |   SPC   |<-------------->|   26-M  |                          |  COMM   |         ------>|   COMM  |                           ---------         |        ---------                               |             |            |                               v             |            v              ------       ---------         |        ---------             | NOCC |<--->|   JPL   |<-------        |         |              ------      | CENTRAL |                |   GSFC  |              ------      |   COMM  |                | NASCOMM |             | MCCC |<--->| TERMINAL|<-------------->|         |              ------       ---------                  ---------                                                       ^     ^                                                       |     |                    CANBERRA (SPC 40) <----------------      |                                                             |                      MADRID (SPC 60) <----------------------                             GOLDSTONE     CANBERRA      MADRID              Antenna        SPC 10       SPC 40       SPC 60             --------      ---------     --------     --------             26-m            DSS 16       DSS 46       DSS 66             34-m STD        DSS 12       DSS 42       DSS 61                             DSS 18       DSS 48       DSS 68             34-m HEF        DSS 15       DSS 45       DSS 65             70-m            DSS 14       DSS 43       DSS 63             Developmental   DSS 13       Subsystem interconnections at each DSCC are shown in the     diagram below, and they are described in the sections that     follow.

The DMC is the center of activity at a DSCC.  The       DMC receives and archives most of the information from the       NOCC needed by the various DSCC subsystems during their       operation.  Control of most of the DSCC subsystems, as well       as the handling and displaying of any responses to control       directives and configuration and status information received       from each of the subsystems, is done through the DMC.  The       effect of this is to centralize the control, display, and       archiving functions necessary to operate a DSCC.       Communication among the various subsystems is done using a       Local Area Network (LAN) hooked up to each subsystem via a       network interface unit (NIU).         DMC operations are divided into two separate areas: the       Complex Monitor and Control (CMC) and the Link Monitor and       Control (LMC).  The primary purpose of the CMC processor for       Radio Science support is to receive and store all predict       sets transmitted from NOCC such as Radio Science, antenna       pointing, tracking, receiver, and uplink predict sets and       then, at a later time, to distribute them to the appropriate       subsystems via the LAN.  Those predict sets can be stored in       the CMC for a maximum of three days under normal conditions.       The CMC also receives, processes, and displays event/alarm       messages; maintains an operator log; and produces tape labels       for the DSP.  Assignment and configuration of the LMCs is       done through the CMC; to a limited degree the CMC can perform       some of the functions performed by the LMC.  There are two       CMCs (one on-line and one backup) and three LMCs at each DSCC       The backup CMC can function as an additional LMC if       necessary.         The LMC processor provides the operator interface for monitor       and control of a link -- a group of equipment required to       support a spacecraft pass.  For Radio Science, a link might       include the DSCC Spectrum Processing Subsystem (DSP) (which,       in turn, can control the SSI), or the Tracking Subsystem.       The LMC also maintains an operator log which includes       operator directives and subsystem responses.  One important       Radio Science specific function that the LMC performs is       receipt and transmission of the system temperature and signal       level data from the PPM for display at the LMC console and       for inclusion in Monitor blocks.  These blocks are recorded       on magnetic tape as well as appearing in the Mission Control       and Computing Center (MCCC) displays.  The LMC is required to       operate without interruption for the duration of the Radio       Science data acquisition period.         The Area Routing Assembly (ARA), which is part of the Digital       Communications Subsystem, controls all data communication       between the stations and JPL.  The ARA receives all required       data and status messages from the LMC/CMC and can record them       to tape as well as transmit them to JPL via data lines.  The       ARA also receives predicts and other data from JPL and passes       them on to the CMC.         DSCC Antenna Mechanical Subsystem     ---------------------------------       Multi-mission Radio Science activities require support from       the 70-m, 34-m HEF, and 34-m STD antenna subnets.  The       antennas at each DSCC function as large-aperture collectors       which, by double reflection, cause the incoming radio       frequency (RF) energy to enter the feed horns.  The large       collecting surface of the antenna focuses the incoming energy       onto a subreflector, which is adjustable in both axial and       angular position.  These adjustments are made to correct for       gravitational deformation of the antenna as it moves between       zenith and the horizon; the deformation can be as large as 5       cm.  The subreflector adjustments optimize the channeling of       energy from the primary reflector to the subreflector and       then to the feed horns.  The 70-m and 34-m HEF antennas have       'shaped' primary and secondary reflectors, with forms that       are modified paraboloids.  This customization allows more       uniform illumination of one reflector by another.  The 34-m       STD primary reflectors are classical paraboloids, while the       subreflectors are standard hyperboloids.         On the 70-m and 34-m STD antennas, the subreflector directs       received energy from the antenna onto a dichroic plate, a       device which reflects S-band energy to the S-band feed horn       and passes X-band energy through to the X-band feed horn.  In       the 34-m HEF, there is one 'common aperture feed,' which       accepts both frequencies without requiring a dichroic plate.       RF energy to be transmitted into space by the horns is       focused by the reflectors into narrow cylindrical beams,       pointed with high precision (either to the dichroic plate or       directly to the subreflector) by a series of drive motors and       gear trains that can rotate the movable components and their       support structures.         The different antennas can be pointed by several means.  Two       pointing modes commonly used during tracking passes are       CONSCAN and 'blind pointing.' With CONSCAN enabled and a       closed loop receiver locked to a spacecraft signal, the       system tracks the radio source by conically scanning around       its position in the sky.  Pointing angle adjustments are       computed from signal strength information (feedback) supplied       by the receiver.  In this mode the Antenna Pointing Assembly       (APA) generates a circular scan pattern which is sent to the       Antenna Control System (ACS).  The ACS adds the scan pattern       to the corrected pointing angle predicts.  Software in the       receiver-exciter controller computes the received signal       level and sends it to the APA.  The correlation of scan       position with the received signal level variations allows the       APA to compute offset changes which are sent to the ACS.       Thus, within the capability of the closed-loop control       system, the scan center is pointed precisely at the apparent       direction of the spacecraft signal source.  An additional       function of the APA is to provide antenna position angles and       residuals, antenna control mode/status information, and       predict-correction parameters to the Area Routing Assembly       (ARA) via the LAN, which then sends this information to JPL       via the Ground Communications Facility (GCF) for antenna       status monitoring.         During periods when excessive signal level dynamics or low       received signal levels are expected (e.g., during an       occultation experiment), CONSCAN should not be used.  Under       these conditions, blind pointing (CONSCAN OFF) is used, and       pointing angle adjustments are based on a predetermined       Systematic Error Correction (SEC) model.         Independent of CONSCAN state, subreflector motion in at least       the z-axis may introduce phase variations into the received       Radio Science data.  For that reason, during certain       experiments, the subreflector in the 70-m and 34-m HEFs may       be frozen in the z-axis at a position (often based on       elevation angle) selected to minimize phase change and signal       degradation.  This can be done via Operator Control Inputs       (OCIs) from the LMC to the Subreflector Controller (SRC)       which resides in the alidade room of the antennas.  The SRC       passes the commands to motors that drive the subreflector to       the desired position.  Unlike the 70-m and 34-m HEFs which       have azimuth-elevation (AZ-EL) drives, the 34-m STD antennas       use (hour angle-declination) HA-DEC drives.  The same       positioning of the subreflector on the 34-m STD does not       create the same effect as on the 70-m and 34-m HEFs.         Pointing angles for all three antenna types are computed by       the NOCC Support System (NSS) from an ephemeris provided by       the flight project.  These predicts are received and archived       by the CMC.  Before each track, they are transferred to the       APA, which transforms the direction cosines of the predicts       into AZ-EL coordinates for the 70-m and 34-m HEFs or into       HA-DEC coordinates for the 34-m STD antennas.  The LMC       operator then downloads the antenna AZ-EL or HA-DEC predict       points to the antenna-mounted ACS computer along with a       selected SEC model.  The pointing predicts consist of       time-tagged AZ-EL or HA-DEC points at selected time intervals       along with polynomial coefficients for interpolation between       points.         The ACS automatically interpolates the predict points,       corrects the pointing predicts for refraction and       subreflector position, and adds the proper systematic error       correction and any manually entered antenna offsets.  The ACS       then sends angular position commands for each axis at the       rate of one per second.  In the 70-m and 34-m HEF, rate       commands are generated from the position commands at the       servo controller and are subsequently used to steer the       antenna.  In the 34-m STD antennas motors, rather than       servos, are used to steer the antenna; there is no feedback       once the 34-m STD has been told where to point.         When not using binary predicts (the routine mode for       spacecraft tracking), the antennas can be pointed using       'planetary mode' -- a simpler mode which uses right ascension       (RA) and declination (DEC) values.  These change very slowly       with respect to the celestial frame.  Values are provided to       the station in text form for manual entry.  The ACS       quadratically interpolates among three RA and DEC points       which are on one-day centers.         A third pointing mode -- sidereal -- is available for       tracking radio sources fixed with respect to the celestial       frame.         Regardless of the pointing mode being used, a 70-m antenna       has a special high-accuracy pointing capability called       'precision' mode.  A pointing control loop derives the main       AZ-EL pointing servo drive error signals from a two- axis       autocollimator mounted on the Intermediate Reference       Structure.  The autocollimator projects a light beam to a       precision mirror mounted on the Master Equatorial drive       system, a much smaller structure, independent of the main       antenna, which is exactly positioned in HA and DEC with shaft       encoders.  The autocollimator detects elevation/cross-       elevation errors between the two reference surfaces by       measuring the angular displacement of the reflected light       beam.  This error is compensated for in the antenna servo by       moving the antenna in the appropriate AZ-EL direction.       Pointing accuracies of 0.004 degrees (15 arc seconds) are       possible in 'precision' mode.  The 'precision' mode is not       available on 34-m antennas -- nor is it needed, since their       beamwidths are twice as large as on the 70-m antennas.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:lpw.maven,LPW,Langmuir Probe and Waves Instrument,The LPW instrument measures the electron density (ne) and temperature (Te) of Mars ionosphere and detects waves that can heat ions in resulting in atmospheric loss. The instrument is designed to measure three different types of quantities using three sensors. First is the Extreme UltraViolet (EUV) sensor monitoring the irradiance of the Sun. The details of the EUV sensor and higher order data products are described separately. The other two quantities use the same sensors to measure the in-situ plasma. The sensors are two cylindrical sensors mounted on two ~7-meter booms. Electronically the LPW sensors 1 and 2 are either operated as two separate Langmuir probe (LP) instruments or as one electric field instrument. The Boom Electronics Board (BEB) and the Digital Fields Board (DFB) controls the three sensors and process the three sensor information. The LPW is a part of the Particle and Fields (PF) suite and controlled by Particle and Fields Digital Processing Unit (PFDPU).  The BEB and DFB are part of the PFDPU located inside the spacecraft body.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:lro.crat,COSMIC RAY TELESCOPE FOR THE EFFECTS OF RADIATION for LRO,COSMIC RAY TELESCOPE FOR THE EFFECTS OF RADIATION,"     Abstract:   =========       The investigation hardware consists of a single, integrated sensor     and electronics box with simple electronic and mechanical interfaces     to the LRO spacecraft. The CRaTER sensor front-end design is based on     standard stacked-detector, cosmic ray telescope systems that have been     flown for decades, using detectors developed for other NASA flight     programs. The analog electronics design is virtually identical to the     robust and flight-proven design of the NASA/POLAR Imaging Proton     Spectrometer that has been operating flawlessly on orbit since 1996.     The digital processing unit is a simple and straightforward design     also based on similar instruments with excellent spaceflight heritage.     No new technology developments or supporting research are required for     the final design, fabrication, and operation of this instrument..       The text of this instrument description has been abstracted from the     instrument paper [CHINETAL2007] and from a preliminary draft of the     CRaTER Instrument Calibration Plan [KASPER2007].     Scientific Objectives:   ======================       The Cosmic Ray Telescope for the Effects of Radiation (CRaTER) is     designed to answer key questions to enable future human exploration of     the Solar System, and to address one of the prime objectives of LRO.     Specifically, CRaTER addresses an objective required by NASA's     Exploration Initiative to safely return humans to the Moon; CRaTER is     designed to achieve characterization of the global lunar radiation     environment and its biological impacts and potential mitigation, as     well as investigation of shielding capabilities and validation of other     deep space radiation mitigation strategies involving materials. CRaTER     will fill knowledge gaps regarding radiation effects, provide     fundamental progress in knowledge of the Moon's radiation environment,     and provide specific path-finding benefits for future planned human     exploration. CRaTER's primary measurement goal is to measure directly     the linear energy transfer (LET) spectra caused by space radiation     penetrating shielding material. Such LET spectra are a missing link,     currently derived by models which require experimental measurements to     provide ground truth. CRaTER will provide this essential information     about the lunar radiation environment.       LET is defined as the mean energy absorbed locally, per unit path     length, when an energetic particle traverses material. A LET     spectrometer measures the amount of energy deposited in a detector of     known thickness and material property when an energetic particle passes     through it, usually without stopping. LET measurements behind various     thicknesses and types of material are of great importance to spacecraft     engineers and radiation health specialists. Such measurements are     especially important to modelers who study the impacts of the     penetrating radiation; LET is one of the most important inputs for     predictive models of human health risks and radiation effects in     electronic devices. While LET spectrometers do not necessarily resolve     particle mass, LET measurements do include all the species, with the     possible exception of neutrons, that are relevant to the energy     deposited behind a known amount of spacecraft shielding. A LET     spectrometer essentially provides the key direct measurement needed to     bridge the gap between well measured cosmic ray intensities (that will     be available from other spacecraft) and specific energy deposition     behind shielding materials, exploration-enabling knowledge vital to the     safety of humans working in the harsh space radiation environment.     Accordingly, CRaTER is designed to measure this important quantity and     thereby provide critical closure between measurements, theory, and     modeling.       CRaTER will measure LET spectra produced by incident galactic cosmic     rays (GCRs) and solar energetic protons (SEPs). GCRs and SEPs with     energies >10 MeV have sufficient energy to penetrate even moderate     shielding. When they interact with matter, they leave behind energy,     damaging the human tissue and electronic parts they pass through. GCRs     and SEPs possess both short and long timescale variations (see Fig.     10), some of which are predictable and others that are not presently     predictable. GCRs are a slowly-varying and uniform source of cosmic     radiation that bathes the solar system. SEPs are episodic and rare, but     come in extreme bursts associated with intense solar magnetic activity.     Both GCRs and SEPs pose serious risks to humans venturing above the     relative safety of low-Earth orbit and the Earths powerful magnetic     shield; areas including the Moon and the interplanetary space between     Earth and Mars may be dangerous to humans.       In order to achieve the LRO radiation mission requirement, CRaTER is     designed to return the following required data products:       * Measure and characterize that aspect of the deep space radiation     environment, LET spectra of galactic and solar cosmic rays     (particularly above 10 MeV), most critically important to the     engineering and modeling communities to assure safe, long-term, human     presence in space.       * Investigate the effects of shielding by measuring LET spectra behind     different amounts and types of areal density, including     tissue-equivalent plastic.       The CRaTER measurement concept is shown in the see-thru telescope     drawing below (Fig. 11). The investigation hardware consists of a     single, integrated telescope and electronics box with straightforward     electronic and mechanical interfaces to the spacecraft. The     zenith-nadir viewing telescope employs a stack of three pairs of     detectors embedded within aluminum structure and tissue-equivalent     plastic (TEP) to establish the LET spectra of cosmic radiation relevant     for human health and electronics part concerns.       Primary GCRs and SEPs enter the telescope through the zenith,     deep-space entrance, depositing energy in the telescope stack through     ionizing radiation and producing secondary particles through nuclear     interactions. The primary and secondary particles interact with one or     more of the six detectors through the stack: the thin (thick) detectors     are optimized for high (low) LET interactions. Events with sufficient     energy deposition in a detector cross a trigger threshold. Digital     logic then compares multi-detection coincidences with predefined event     masks to identify desirable events. Pulse height analysis is performed     on every detector to measure LET at each point in the stack.       The measurement team will use observations taken during the mission to     construct LET spectra behind the different amounts of material,     including TEP, as a function of particle environment (GCR vs. SEP;     foreshock vs. magnetotail vs. solar wind; etc.). The team will also     test models of radiation effects and shielding by verifying/validating     deterministic models.       Model predictions of energy transport of incident GCR and SEP spectra     (available contemporaneously on other missions) through the CRaTER     instrument will be compared to the measured LET spectra. Thus, CRaTER     will provide not only direct measurements of LET in the lunar     environment, but will also better constrain radiation effects models     that are being used to assess the effects of other radiation     environments, including in interplanetary space and at Mars.     Calibration:   ============       The calibration of the CRaTER Flight Models is based on lessons learned     from experiences with the Engineering Model: the relationship between     the value returned by the detectors and the original energy deposited is     essentially linear. Gains and offsets for each detector are determined     with high precision by calibrating the instrument with a beam of high     energy protons produced by the Northeast Proton Therapy Center (NPTC) of     Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) in Boston. A 300 MeV proton beam at     MGH is degraded in energy using sheets of plastic until a beam is produced     with large energy dispersion and a peak energy tuned to the response of     a pair of thin and thick CRaTER detectors. The dispersed beam produces     a characteristic track in energy deposition in the pair of detectors.     The gains and offsets for each of the detectors is then determined by     iteratively varying the free parameters of the instrument response until     the measurements match the predictions of GEANT numerical simulations     of the energy loss.       Operational Modes:   ===========================       The CRaTER instrument has only two modes: powered up and powered down.     There are no operational constraints on these modes. In particular,     CRaTER can be powered up during the cruise phase of the mission, and     will return scientifically useful data.     Sensors:   ==========       The investigation hardware consists of a single, integrated sensor and     electronics box with simple electronic and mechanical interfaces to the     LRO spacecraft. The CRaTER sensor front-end design is based on standard     stacked-detector, cosmic ray telescope systems that have been flown for     decades, using detectors developed for other NASA flight programs. The     analog electronics design is virtually identical to the robust and flight-     proven design of the NASA/POLAR Imaging Proton Spectrometer that has been     operating flawlessly on orbit since 1996. The digital processing unit is     a simple and straightforward design also based on similar instruments     with excellent spaceflight heritage. No new technology developments or     supporting research are required for the final design, fabrication, and     operation of this instrument.         The CRaTER telescope consists of six ion-implanted silicon detectors,     mounted on detector boards, and separated by pieces of tissue-     equivalent plastic, hereinafter referred to as TEP. All six of the     silicon detectors are 2 cm in diameter. Detectors 1, 3, and 5 are 140m     thick; the others are 1000m thick. TEP (such as A-150 manufactured by     Standard Imaging) simulates soft body tissue (muscle) and has been used     for both ground-based as well as space-based (i.e., Space Station)     experiments.       Solid-state detectors use semi-conducting crystals (in CRaTERs case,     silicon) with n-type (electron-rich, electron conducting) and p-type     (electron-deficient, hole conducting) regions.       When a reversed bias voltage is applied across the junction, the     un-bonded electrons in the semiconductor are pushed away from the     voltage source, while the holes are pulled towards it. This leaves a     neutral area void of charge and current at the junction of the sectors,     called the depletion region. As incoming radiation (e.g., a solar     proton or cosmic ray particle) collides with the depletion region,     electron-hole pairs are formed in the material (where a once bonded     electron is freed from its atom, leaving a hole). The electron and the     hole respond to the applied voltage, and a small current is created.     This current can be detected and later analyzed.       A cold environment greatly reduces the transmission of thermal     signals. In addition, the solid state of the semiconducting material     makes it easier to detect those signals attributable to freed     electrons.       Tissue equivalent plastic (or TEP) is a plastic recipe designed to     simulate human tissue. It includes hydrogen and nitrogen     percentages-by-composition that are similar to that found in human skin     and muscle. Scientists can use the atomic-level effects that radiation     has on the TEP to deduce what sort of similar effects may occur in     humans.     Electronics:   ============       The front-end analog electronics utilize charge amplifiers to collect     signals from the six silicon detectors, amplify, and pulse-shape them     for high-level processing. The backend digital electronics receives the     six signals converts them in parallel to 12-bit digital quantities and,     using a programmable coincidence mask, filters out the events of     interest. Those events are then packed into standard CCSDS data packets     and forwarded to the spacecraft data system for storage and eventual     telemetry to the ground. A field programmable logic array contains all     of the digital circuitry that receives commands from the spacecraft and     handles telemetry packet formatting as well as collecting useful     secondary science and analog housekeeping information. There is no     processor or software within the instrument.       The maximum event rate that the instrument can telemeter is limited to     1200 events/second, enforced separately for every 1 second interval;     excess events are discarded. The instrument has an internal deadtime of     12 microseconds. Events are time-tagged to an accuracy of 1 second.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:lro.dlre,DIVINER LUNAR RADIOMETER EXPERIMENT for LRO,DIVINER LUNAR RADIOMETER EXPERIMENT,"   Instrument Overview ===================   The Diviner Lunar Radiometer Experiment is in most respects a copy of the Mars Climate Sounder (MCS) instrument on Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.  Both instruments observe radiation with 21 detectors in each of nine spectral bands.  MCS is primarily an atmospheric limb sounder that measures temperature, pressure, water vapor, dust, and condensates at Mars' atmospheric limb.  In contrast, Diviner is a surface pushbroom mapper that measures emitted thermal radiation and reflected solar radiation from the surface of the moon. Two Diviner solar channels measure 0.3-3 micrometers reflected solar radiation.  Three Diviner channels near 8 micrometers classify regolith mineralogy by mapping the location of the Christiansen feature.  The remaining four Diviner channels measure surface temperature in four spectral bands ranging from 12.5 micrometers to beyond 200 micrometers.   Hardware Overview =================   The Diviner Lunar Radiometer Experiment is a nine channel infrared radiometer employing filter radiometry. These channels are distributed between two identical, boresighted telescopes, and an articulated elevation/azimuth mount allows the telescopes to view the lunar surface, space, and calibration targets. The instantaneous field-of-view (FOV) response of each channel is defined by a linear, 21-element, thermopile detector array at the telescope focal plane, and its spectral response is defined by a focal plane bandpass filter.   The Diviner structure consists of an instrument optics bench assembly (OBA), an elevation/azimuth yoke, and an instrument mount. The OBA contains all of the instrument optical subassemblies, and is suspended from the yoke. Elevation and azimuth motors mounted on the yoke drive instrument articulation. The OBA can be temperature controlled, and internal temperature gradients are minimized by design. Radiometric calibration is provided by views of blackbody and solar targets mounted on the yoke. The electronics subassemblies control signal processing, instrument operation and articulation, command processing, and data processing.  These electronics are distributed between the OBA and the yoke.   For more information, including instrument diagrams and channel bandpasses and functions, please see the EDR Software Interface Specification (SIS).

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:lro.lamp,LYMAN ALPHA MAPPING PROJECT for LRO,LYMAN ALPHA MAPPING PROJECT,"       INSTRUMENT OVERVIEW   ===================     The LAMP description is adapted from Gladstone et al. (2005)     [GLADSTONEETAL2005] and Gladstone et al. (2008) [GLADSTONEETAL2008].       The Lyman Alpha Mapping Project (LAMP) instrument is one of the remote     sensing instruments on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) spacecraft     that will acquire orbital observations of the lunar surface during a one     year primary mapping phase.  LRO is scheduled to launch in April 2009 and     arrive at the Moon approximately four days later.  Lunar orbit insertion     will place the spacecraft into a quasi-frozen 30 x 216 kilometer near-     polar orbit suitable for the commissioning phase, which will last     approximately 60 days.  At the end of commissioning, final orbit maneuvers     will insert LRO into the nominal mission orbit, a mean 50 kilometer polar     orbit in which LRO will remain for at least one year.       LAMP is a far ultraviolet spectrograph provided by the Southwest Research     Institute (SwRI).  LAMP's nadir observing geometry on the LRO spacecraft     will translate its 0.3 x 6 degree field of view into a footprint of 0.26 x     5.2 kilometers on the lunar surface from an altitude of 50 kilometers.     LAMP will measure the signal reflected from the nightside lunar surface     and Permanently Shaded Regions (PSRs) using Lyman-alpha sky-glow and UV     starlight as light sources.  LAMP data will nominally be taken entirely in     time-tagged mode, allowing mapping at a variety of resolutions.     Reflectance data will yield albedo maps of PSRs, spectra of PSRs will     yield exposed water frost abundances, and atmospheric spectra will yield     species abundances and variability.       The LAMP instrument is closely based on the Pluto Alice (P-Alice)     instrument design (Stern et al. 2005 [STERNETAL2005]; Slater et al. 2005     [SLATERETAL2005]; Stern et al. 2008 [STERNETAL2008]), which is, in turn,     based largely on the Rosetta Alice (R-Alice) instrument design (Stern et     al. 1998 [STERNETAL1998]; Slater et al. 2001 [SLATERETAL2001]), with only     relatively minor changes in baffling, software, and the addition of a     lunar terminator sensor.       SPECIFICATIONS     --------------       NAME:                    LAMP     DESCRIPTION:             Ultraviolet Mapping Spectrograph     PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR:  Randy Gladstone, SwRI     WAVELENGTH RANGE:        57.5 - 196.5 nm (first order) [Note 1]     FIELD OF VIEW:           (0.31 +/- 0.01) X (6.00 +/- 0.01) deg [Note 1]     ANGULAR RESOLUTION:      0.29 +/- 0.03 deg per spatial pixel [Note 1]     WAVELENGTH RESOLUTION:   0.182 +/- 0.001 nm [Note 1]       Note 1:  Measured performance       SCIENTIFIC OBJECTIVES   =====================     The primary scientific objectives of LAMP are:       1) To generate albedo maps of all PSRs       2) To develop exposed water-frost concentration maps of the lunar polar     regions       CALIBRATION   ===========     Ground radiometric characterization and absolute calibration of the     instrument was performed at SwRI's UV space instrument calibration     facility located in SwRI's Space Science and Engineering Division.  The     radiometric vacuum chamber consists of a 4-inch diameter off-axis     parabolic collimator mirror that is fed by a differentially pumped hollow-     cathode UV light source and an Acton Research Corporation VM-502 vacuum     monochromator.  A variable slit and pinhole assembly at the output of the     monochromator (and situated at the focus of the collimator mirror) allowed     for point source illumination of the LAMP airglow input apertures.     Radiometric characterization tests included the detector dark count rate,     wavelength calibration, spectral and spatial point spread function (PSF)     versus wavelength, filled slit spectral resolution, off-axis stray light     attenuation, and absolute effective area measurements as a function of     wavelength.  See Gladstone et al. (2008) for further details.       During the commissioning phase, the LAMP instrument will be commanded to     perform five different calibration activities: (1) raster scan star     calibrations; (2) stare star calibrations; (3) dark count rate     calibrations; (4) flat field calibrations; and (5) stray light     calibration.  In addition to these calibration activities, LAMP will     perform instrument characterizations such as high voltage (HV)     discriminator setting tests as well as periodic decontamination using     internal heaters.       During the nominal mission phase, instrument calibrations will be     performed in conjunction with the monthly station-keeping maneuvers.  For     LAMP these will include all five types mentioned above for the     commissioning phase.       OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS   ==========================     The LAMP instrument will collect measurement data only over the night     portion of the orbit until minimum mission objectives are satisfied.     Nominally, LAMP will operate in pixel list (time-tagged photon)     acquisition mode.  When LRO crosses the lunar terminator (day to night),     the high voltage (HV) will be ramped up to full operating level.  The     ramp-up is triggered by the Lunar Terminator Sensor (LTS).  Prior to     crossing the terminator again (night to day), the HV will be ramped down     to a safe level by the LTS.  While LAMP is operating over the night     portion of the orbit, the instrument will generate measurement data at a     rate of about 30 kbps. The spacecraft will collect and store the data on     the flight recorder.  The spacecraft will store about 113 minutes' worth     (one orbit's worth) of measurement data in each data file. After minimum     mission objectives have been completed, LAMP will operate over the full     orbit.  A small pin-hole in the aperture door of LAMP allows the     instrument to operate over the entire orbit.       The LAMP Science Operations Center (SOC) will generate any required     command activity request.  Activity requests are used to request special     operations or update command sequences.  During nominal operations, the     LTS will be used to trigger the high-to-low and low-to-high voltage     transitions.  As a contingency, the Mission Operations Team (MOT) will     have the ability to generate the daily command loads that include commands     to trigger the voltage transitions based on the predicted terminator-     crossing times generated by the Flight Dynamics Facility (FDF).  This     procedure will be used, if needed, as a backup to the LTS.       LAMP operations also involve a number of constraints to avoid damage to     the instrument.  These include keeping the LAMP boresight pointed away     from the Sun and other designated UV-bright stars, as well as making sure     that the instrument is in a proper state prior to conducting certain     operations.       DETECTORS   =========     The 2-D imaging photon-counting detector located in the spectrograph     section of the instrument utilizes a microchannel plate (MCP) Z-stack that     feeds the double-delay line (DDL) readout array.  The input surface of the     Z-stack is coated with an opaque photocathode of CsI.  The detector body     tube is a custom design made of a lightweight brazed alumina-Kovar     structure that is welded to a housing that supports the DDL anode array.       To capture the entire 57.5-196.5 nm passband and 6 degree spatial field of     view (FOV), the size of the detector's active area is 35 mm (in the     dispersion direction) by 20 mm (in the spatial dimension), with a pixel     format of 1024 x 32 pixels.  The 6 degree slit-height is imaged onto the     central 22 of the detector's 32 spatial channels; the remaining spatial     channels are used for dark count monitoring.  LAMP's pixel format allows     Nyquist sampling with a spectral resolution of 0.36 nm, and a spatial     resolution of ~0.6 degree.       The MCP Z-stack is composed of three 80:1 length-to-diameter MCPs that are     cylindrically curved with a radius of curvature of 75 mm to match the     Rowland-circle for optimum focus.  The total Z-stack resistance is ~300     MOhms. The MCPs are rectangular in format (46 x 30 mm^2), with 12 um     diameter pores. Above the MCP Z-stack is a repeller grid that is biased     ~900 V more negative than the top of the MCP Z-stack.  This repeller grid     reflects electrons liberated in the interstitial regions of the MCP back     down to the MCP input surface to enhance the detector quantum efficiency.     The MCP Z-stack requires a high voltage bias of ~-3 kV; an additional -600     V is required between the MCP Z-stack output and the anode array (the     anode array is referenced to ground).  The lab-measured dark count rate of     the flight MCP stack is quite low and stable--less than 6 Hz over the     entire MCP active area.  The on-orbit dark count rate will likely be     considerably larger, however, (probably ~20 Hz or so) due to the energetic     particle environment in space.       ELECTRONICS   ===========     The detector electronics amplify and convert the detected output pulses     from the MCP Z-stack to pixel address locations.  Only those analog pulses     output from the MCP that have amplitudes above a set threshold level are     processed and converted to pixel address locations.  For each detected and     processed event, a 10-bit X (spectral) address and a 5-bit Y (spatial)     address are generated by the detector electronics and sent to the LAMP     command and data handling (C&DH) electronics for data storage and     manipulation.  In addition to the pixel address words, the detector     electronics also digitizes the analog amplitude of the detected event     output by the preamplifiers and sends this datum to the C&DH electronics.     Histogramming of this 'pulse-height' information creates a pulse-height     distribution used to monitor the health and status of the detector during     operation.  An analog count rate signal is output from the detector     electronics to the C&DH to allow monitoring and recording of the detector     total array count rate.  This count rate is updated once per second and is     included in the LAMP housekeeping data.  A built-in 'stim-pulser' is     included in the electronics that stimulates photon events at two pixel     locations on the array.  This pulser can be turned on and off by command     and allows testing of the entire detector and C&DH electronics signal path     without having to power on the detector high-voltage power supplies     (HVPSs) or put light on the detector.       The LAMP instrument support electronics include the low-voltage power     supply (LVPS) and actuator electronics, the C&DH electronics, the optics     decontamination heater system, and the redundant detector HVPSs.  All of     these subsystems are controlled by a radiation-hardened version of the     Intel 8052 microprocessor with 32 kB of fuse programmable PROM, 128 kB of     EEPROM, 32 kB of SRAM, and 128 kB of acquisition memory.  The C&DH     electronics are contained on four circuit boards located just behind the     detector electronics.       OPTICS   ======     The LAMP spectrograph comprises a telescope and Rowland-circle     spectrograph. LAMP has a single 40 x 40 mm^2 entrance aperture that feeds     light to the telescope section of the instrument.  Entering light is     collected and focused by an f/3 off-axis paraboloidal (OAP) primary mirror     at the back end of the telescope section onto the instrument's entrance     slit.  After passing through the entrance slit, the light falls onto a     toroidal holographic diffraction grating, which disperses the light onto     the DDL MCP detector.       The OAP mirror and diffraction grating are constructed from monolithic     pieces of aluminum, coated with electroless nickel and polished using low-     scatter polishing techniques.  The aluminum optics, in conjunction with     the aluminum housing, form an athermal optical design.  Both the OAP     mirror and the grating are overcoated with sputtered Al/MgF2 for optimum     reflectivity within LAMP's spectral passband.  Besides using low-scatter     optics, additional control of internal stray light is achieved using     internal baffle vanes within both the telescope and spectrograph sections     of the housing, a holographic diffraction grating that has low scatter and     near-zero line ghost problems, and an internal housing with alodyned     aluminum surfaces.  In addition, the zero order baffle is treated with a     nickel-phosphorus (Ni-P) black coating with very low surface reflectance     at EUV/FUV wavelengths.       OPERATIONAL MODES   =================     LAMP has two detector data collection modes: i) pixel list mode; and ii)     histogram mode.  However, because of its nature and its mission, nearly     all the LAMP data will be obtained in pixel list mode (exceptions will be     made for flat-field and pulse-height distribution measurements).  The     science data from the detector are collected in the dual port acquisition     memory that consists of two separate 32K x 16-bit memory channels.  In     pixel list mode each memory channel can hold up to 32K detector and/or     time-hack events, where each detector event consists of a 16-bit word--an     X-position word 10 bits in length, a Y-position word 5 bits in length, and     a single status bit that distinguishes between a time-hack word and a     detector event word.  A time-hack word includes a single status bit plus     15 bits that encode the instrument time.  When 32K detector address and     time-hack events have accumulated in one of the two acquisition memories,     that acquisition memory stops accumulating event data and begins to read     the data out to a parallel-to-serial converter and a low-voltage     differential signaling (LVDS) interface to the spacecraft on-board memory.     At the same time that this LVDS readout is taking place, the other side of     the dual acquisition memory continues to collect detector and time-hack     data until it fills up, whereupon it reads out to the LVDS interface to     the spacecraft memory, while the first acquisition memory takes over     collecting detector and time-hack data.  This back-and-forth data     collection flow between both acquisition memories is called 'ping-pong'     acquisition--it allows contiguous readout of detector event data as long     as the event data rate does not exceed the rate at which the data can be     read out of memory to the LVDS interface.  The 'ping-pong' acquisition     process is controlled using logic encoded in one of two floating-point     gate arrays (FPGAs) within the C&DH electronics.       LAMP also includes a flight software mechanism to filter out events from     selected areas of the detector.  This may be used to suppress 'hot' pixels     that could develop in the detector, especially in the pixel list mode,     which might otherwise consume a large fraction of the available     acquisition memory. This filtering is performed before events are     processed in either histogram or pixel list mode.  The system defines up     to 8 rectangular regions of 32 X 4 pixels that suppress any events from     the selected regions from being processed.  Configuration parameters allow     for the placement of these filtered areas at any desired positions within     the detector area.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:lro.lend,LUNAR EXPLORATION NEUTRON DETECTOR for LRO,LUNAR EXPLORATION NEUTRON DETECTOR,"       Instrument Overview   ===================     The Lunar Exploration Neutron Detector, LEND, was designed and     built by P.I. Igor Mitrofanov at the Russian Space Institute for     incorporation into NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) as     a large orbital neutron telescope for mapping the Moon's neutron     albedo. LEND is the follow-on instrument from the High Energy     Neutron Detector (HEND) onboard Mars Odyssey, although LEND     incorporates a set of collimated detectors to improve spatial     resolution. The methods and procedures of LEND data processing     and analysis are based on existing procedures that have been     developed for analysis of HEND data.       The LEND instrument is based on the registration of secondary     neutrons from the Moon, which are created in the upper 1-2 meters     of lunar regolith which is irradiated by cosmic rays. Neutrons     of high energy are born in the regolith and then slowed down and     absorbed by nuclei of the major elements in the regolith through     inelastic scattering and capture. The neutron     flux coming out of the regolith depends upon the composition of     the regolith, and is strongly affected by the presence of hydrogen     or its compounds. When colliding with a hydrogen nucleus, a     neutron losses half of its energy which leads to fast     thermalization, thus to a significant increase of the flux of     thermal neutrons and reduction in the flux of the epithermal     neutrons. The orbital flux of epithermal neutrons depeds upon     the hydrogen content of the regolith.       Usage of different methods of neutron spectrometry allows us to     obtain the average hydrogen or water ice content along with     estimates of thickness of the ice cover due to comparison of     counting rates of neutrons having different energies. The flux of     epithermal neutrons and the flux of fast neutrons depend upon the     thickness of water ice on the Lunar surface.       LEND has eight 3He sensors for detecting thermal and epithermal     neutrons. Four of the 3He sensors un-collimated and four are     collimated. The external sensors STN1-3 (Sensor Thermal Neutrons)     and SETN (Sensor EpiThermal Neutrons) are the un-collimated     sensors that detect thermal and epithermal neutrons. STN-3 and     SETN both have open fields of view. The combination of these two     sensors will allow the measurement of local density of thermal and     epithermal neutrons around the spacecraft. STN 1 and 2 are located     near the midpoint of the instrument and have the thick mass of the     collimation module just between them. For sensors on the +X and -X     sides, the collimation material absorbs all external particles     coming from directions -X and +X, respectively. The velocity     vector of LRO will correspond to one of these directions:     therefore, sensors STN 1 and 2 will detect neutrons with     velocities (Vn + Vorb) and (Vn - Vorb), respectively, and will     operate as a Doppler filter to separate the flux of external     neutrons from the Moon from the local spacecraft background. The     full set of four sensors, SETN and STN 1-3, will provide the data     to characterize the neutron component of lunar radiation     background at the altitude of LRO separately from the neutron     component of local background produced by LRO itself.       The collimated sensors of epithermal neutrons, CSETN1-4, are also     3He counters, that are installed inside the collimating module,     which effectively absorbs external neutrons outside of instrument     Field of View. Absorbing neutrons is very difficult; one of the     best absorbing materials is 10B, and its absorption efficiency     becomes much higher when neutrons are slower. The LEND     collimators have external layers of polyethylene for moderation     of impacting neutrons and internal layers of 10B for their     efficiency. These sensors are also enclosed by Cd shields that     absorb all neutrons with energies below ~0.4 eV, which mainly     correspond to thermal neutrons. The neutron collimator provides     the instrument Field of View (FOV): epithermal neutrons of direct     flux inside the FOV are recorded by the detector, while the     majority of neutrons outside the FOV are absorbed by the     collimator. This collimation technique provides mapping of     epithermal neutrons from the Moon's surface with the horizontal     resolution of 5 km for LRO at an altitude of 50 km.       The final LEND sensor is the Sensor for High Energy Neutrons     (SHEN), which is a stilbene scintillator that produces a     flash of light each time a high energy neutron in the energy     range 0.3 to 15.0 MeV collides with a hydrogen nucleus and     creates a recoil proton. Special shape-sensitive electronics     distinguish proton counts from electron counts, and an active     anti-coincidence shield eliminates external charged particles.     This sensor is installed inside the central hole of the     collimation unit, and its Field of View corresponds to     40-degree (HWHM). The SHEN sensor outputs data in 16 energy     channels from 300 keV to more than 15 MeV, and is the source     of the SC1-3 spectra.       For further information about the LEND instrument and the     LEND experiment please see MITROFANOVETAL2008].       Scientific Objectives   =====================     The science objectives of neutron mapping of the Moon are     outlined by three investigation tasks developed by the     LRO team.       Task (1) is to explain the origin of the neutron flux depressions     in the lunar polar regions, which could be produced by enhancement     of implanted hydrogen from the solar wind, or by accumulated     deposits of water ice from comet impacts in shadowed craters.       Task (2) focuses on the variation of hydrogen content at moderate     latitudes of the Moon in comparison to surface variations of     minerals, thermal conductivity and soil maturity.       Task (3) corresponds to the measurement of neutrons over a broad     energy range from thermal energies up to tens of MeV to determine     the neutron contribution to the total radiation dose at an altitude     of 50 km above the Moon.       The Lunar Exploration Neutron Detector (LEND) will sddress these     tasks by:       Creating high resolution Hydrogen distribution maps with     sensitivity of about 100 ppm of Hydrogen weight and horizontal     spatial resolution of 5 km.       Characterizing surface distribution and column density of     possible near-surface water ice deposits in the Moon's polar     cold traps.       Creating a global model of neutron component of space     radiation at altitude of 30-50 km above Moon's surface with     spatial resolution of 20-50 km at the spectral range from     thermal energies up to 15 MeV.       Calibration   ===========     Calibration information for the LEND instrument is provided     in the LEND Calibration Report     (calib/LEND_calibration_report.pdf).       Operational Modes   =================     LEND operates autonomously, collecting data throughout the     lunar orbit. LEND generates approximately 0.26 Gbits of     measurement data per day. In order to perform early calibration     measurements, LEND became active shortly after the first mid     course correction (MCC) burn. Operationally, LEND is simple and     has only three instrument modes: MEASUREMENTS, STAND-BY, and     OFF. While in MEASUREMENTS mode, instrument electronics and     detector high voltage are both 'on' and the instrument     generates measurement and housekeeping data. In STAND-BY mode,     instrument electronics are 'on', detector high voltage is 'off',     and only housekeeping data are generated. While in OFF mode,     the instrument is 'off', the instrument external heater is     'on', and only external temperature data are generated.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:lro.lola,LUNAR ORBITER LASER ALTIMETER for LRO,LUNAR ORBITER LASER ALTIMETER,"   INSTRUMENT OVERVIEW ===================     The LOLA instrument was designed, built and tested by the NASA Goddard     Space Flight Center (GSFC). The principal investigator is David E. Smith     (GSFC), and the deputy PI is Maria Zuber (MIT). LOLA has two primary     objectives.       First, it will produce a high-resolution global topographic model and     geodetic framework that will assist with precise targeting, safe landing,     and surface mobility for future scientific and exploration activities.     LOLA will also characterize the polar illumination environment and image     the Moon's permanently-shadowed regions (PSRs) to identify possible     locations of surface ice crystals in shadowed polar craters.       To achieve these primary objectives, LOLA will make three measurements:        1) the distance between the surface and the spacecraft,      2) the spreading of the returned laser pulse, and      3) the transmitted and returned laser energies.       LOLA is a pulse detection, time-of-flight laser altimeter. LOLA transmits     a 5-spot pattern that measures the precise distance to the lunar surface     at multiple points simultaneously, thus providing 5 profiles across the     lunar surface (Figure 1).  Each spot within the five-spot pattern has a     diameter of five meters; the spots are 25 meters apart in the form of a     cross canted by 26 degrees counterclockwise to provide five adjacent     profiles.       The 5-spot pattern enables the surface slope to be derived in the along-     track and across track directions. LOLA's instrument design is similar to     the designs of the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (SMITHETAL2001B) and the     Mercury Laser Altimeter (CAVANAUGHETAL2007), augmented by a novel     diffractive optic element (DOE) (SMITHETAL2009).       It has five beams and five receiver channels, the first of which is also     fiber-optic-coupled to a Laser Ranging (LR) telescope mounted on the High-     Gain Antenna. Because LOLA makes global observations, the LOLA altimetry     data can be used to improve the spacecraft orbit and our knowledge of far     side lunar gravity, which is currently extremely poorly known but is     required for precise landing and low-altitude navigation. Timing of one-     way pulses fired from Earth to the LR will also improve navigation and     gravity determination.       The five received laser pulses are time stamped with respect to the     spacecraft mission elapsed time using a set of time-to-digital converters     at <0.5 ns precision. LOLA measures the transmitted and received pulse     energies by integrating the pulse waveforms. The on-board science     algorithm, running on an embedded microprocessor, autonomously adjusts the     receiver detection threshold levels, detector gain, and range window for     the lunar surface returns.     ----         #4                #5          #1       ---- # shot 3     #3             #2       @4                @5          @1       ---- @ shot 2     @3             @2       *4                *5          *1       ---- * shot 1     *3             *2         Figure 1.

The algorithm seeks to     maximize the probability of detection under varying background noise     conditions, by utilizing hardware noise counters in a fashion similar to     that employed on the MOLA and MLA instruments. A variable range gate     setting opens only during the window of time that returns are expected     from the surface according to the FSW return histograms. To accomodate the     large dynamic range of lunar return strength, a variable gain amplifier is     implemented in hardware prior to the discriminator input. The gain is set     according to tables of range setting - gain setting, one for each     detector. Earth laser ranges are recorded by detector 1 during the 8 ms     window preceding each laser fire, approximately 1-9 ms after the start of     each 28-Hz cycle. The Earth window uses the same threshold and gain     settings as for lunar ranges. Owing to higher background earth counts,     especially during New Moon phases, the detector 1 thresholds are likely     higher than those of the detector 2-5 channels.     ---------------       The data are downlinked to the Ground Data System in the Mission     Operations Center and are transferred to the LOLA SOC at the end of each     downlink pass. LOLA ground software assembles the telemetry files into EDR     data tables, each covering a ~10-minute time period. A housekeeping     telemetry data stream, which is a subset of the science telemetry, is sent     to the LOLA SOC in realtime during tracking passes. The realtime     housekeeping provides energy and signal processing information for the     pulses generated by the LR component.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:lro.lroc,LUNAR RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER CAMERA for LRO,LUNAR RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER CAMERA,"       INSTRUMENT OVERVIEW   ===================       The LROC consists of two narrow-angle camera components (NACs), a wide-     angle camera component (WAC), and a common Sequence and Compressor System     (SCS).       Each NAC has a 700 mm focal length Cassegrain (Ritchey-Chretien) telescope     that images onto a 5064-pixel CCD line-array providing a cross-track     field- of-view (FOV) of 2.86 degrees. The NAC readout noise is better than     76 e- and the data are sampled at 12 bits. By ground command, these 12 bit     pixel values are companded to 8 bit pixels using one of several selectable     piecewise linear mappings during readout from the CCD. The NAC internal     buffer holds 256 MB of uncompressed data, enough for a full-resolution     image 52,224 lines long (26-km from 50-km orbit). NAC specifications are     summarized in Table 1.

The WAC electronics are a copy of those flown on cameras on Mars Climate     Orbiter, Mars Polar Lander, Mars Odyssey, and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.     The WAC has two lenses imaging onto the same 1024 x 1024 pixel,     electronically shuttered CCD area-array, one imaging in the visible/near     infrared (VIS), and the other in the Ultraviolet (UV). In monochrome mode,     1024 x 14 pixels are read out in one visible band (645 nm). In color mode,     only the center 704 x 14 visible pixels and 512 x 16 UV pixels, which are     binned to 128 x 4, are read out for each band. The VIS optics have a     cross- track FOV of 91.7 degrees (monochrome) and 61.4 degrees (color),     and the UV optics a 58.96 degree FOV. From the nominal 50-km orbit, the     WAC will provide a nadir ground sample distance of 74.9 m/pixel in the     visible, and a swath width of 104.6 km (visible monochrome), 59.6 km     (visible color) and 56.8 km (UV color). The seven-band color capability of     the WAC is provided by a color filter array (see Figure 1) mounted     directly over the detector, providing different sections of the CCD with     different filters. Consequently the instrument has no moving parts; it     acquires data in the seven channels in a 'pushframe' mode, with scanning     of the WAC FOV provided by motion of the spacecraft and target. Continuous     color coverage of the lunar surface is possible by repeated imaging such     that each of the narrow framelets of each color band overlap. The WAC has     a readout noise less than 72 e- and, as with the NAC, pixel values are     digitized to 12 bits and are then commanded to 8 bit values through a     square-root-like lookup table. WAC specifications are summarized in Table     2. The two UV bands (320 and 360 nm) undergo 4x4 pixel on-chip analog     summing before digitization to achieve better signal-to-noise ratio.     Thus, UV pixels are recorded at reduced 383.5 m/pixel sampling but have     improved signal properties. Only the center 704 pixels for the visible are     digitized when all seven bands are being acquired. WAC band passes are     arranged first UV then VIS (320, 360, 415, 565, 605, 645, 690), but the     order is reversed after LRO performs a 180 degree yaw maneuver to align     the solar panels with the sun.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:lro.mrflro,MINI-RF LRO for LRO,MINI-RF LRO,"     Abstract:   =========    A polarimetric microwave imager, the Mini-RF is a side-looking synthetic    aperture radar (SAR) instrument that is flying on the Lunar    Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) spacecraft.      Mini-RF operates in imaging modes and as a communications demonstration.    The imaging modes are primarily monostatic (transmitter and receiver    co-located), although there may be opportunities for bistatic experiments    (with two lunar radar spacecraft, or between LRO and an earth-based radar    astronomy facility). Mini-RF also will gather data on several repeat    passes that are designed to support interferometric processing. The radar    architecture is hybrid-polarimetric: transmitting circular polarization,    and receiving coherently H and V linear polarizations. The resulting data    are sufficient to calculate the classical Circular-Polarization-Ratio    (CPR), and also Stokes parameters for more sensitive image analysis.      The primary imaging modes have two resolutions Baseline    (150 m at 16 looks), and Zoom (15 m by 30 m at 8 looks) each at two    frequencies, S-band (12-cm wavelength) or X-band (4-cm wavelength).      The communications demonstrations will be receive-only, and transmit-only,    both with a cooperating earth-based facility. The communications will be    at S-band (12-cm wavelength), and will contribute to calibration of the    antenna pattern's polarimetric characterization.     Scientific Objectives:   ======================    The primary scientific objective of the Mini-RF mission    is to search for water-ice deposits in permanently-shadowed areas of the    north and south polar regions of the Moon.  Water-ice is known to cause    anomalous radar reflectivity signatures (high albedo and high circular    polarization ratio) that differ significantly from the most radar    reflections from typical anhydrous lunar surface material.      As an additional scientific objective, the Mini-RF mission will    characterize the lunar surface roughness at radar wavelength scales    (12-cm and 4-cm) by analysis of the polarimetric properties of the radar    backscatter.     Calibration:   ============      Amplitude calibration    ---------------------    The Mini-RF radar data product is comprised of the amplitude    (or magnitude squared) of the H and the V channels of the    dual-polarized receiver, and also the cross-product of the complex    H and V amplitudes. These data are necessary and sufficient to form    the 2x2 coherency matrix of the backscattered field, which is    alternatively represented by the Stokes parameters, four real numbers.    The first Stokes parameter represents the total backscattered power. This    can be scaled to the normalized reflectivity sigma-zero only if the    end-to-end transformation of the radar is calibrated absolutely. The    starting point for this scaling is the set of pre-flight system data,    coupled with in-flight specifics such as incidence and altitude. During    the mission, absolute calibration will be up-dated by imaging a lunar    area whose reflectivity is well known from Earth-based radar    observatories. However, most lunar science measurements depend on ratios    of the Stokes parameters, for which absolute amplitude calibration is not    required. Rather, gain balance between the H and the V channels is the    key objective. Relative calibration consists of evaluating the corrective    scaling constant of the H amplitude relative to the V amplitude.    Calibration references (noise, tone, and chirp) are included at the    beginning and end of each data take to assist relative amplitude    calibration. During the mission, relative calibration will be up-dated by    radar coverage of the lunar surface at nadir, from which the observed    backscatter should have identical amplitudes seen through both the H and    the V channels. Any difference can be inverted to evaluate the relative    amplitude calibration constant. In addition, the mission plan calls for    relative amplitude calibration through a cooperative transmission and    reception between the spacecraft and an Earth-based radar observatory.    These data will be posted on the PDS when available. (If more specific    information is needed, please consult the Mini-RF Calibration Plan.)      Phase calibration    -----------------    The Mini-RF radar data product is comprised of the amplitude    (or magnitude squared) of the H and the V channels of the dual-polarized    receiver, and also the cross-product of the complex H and V amplitudes.    The cross-product is one representation of the phase to be calibrated.    These data are necessary and sufficient to form the 2x2 coherency matrix    of the backscattered field, which is alternatively represented by the    Stokes parameters, four real numbers. The first Stokes parameter is the    total backscattered power (see Amplitude Calibration). Under the    operational assumption that the radar transmits circular polarization,    the relative phase (in the cross-product) is central to the third and the    fourth Stokes parameter. Relative phase calibration consists of    evaluating the corrective phase rotation constant of the H complex    amplitude relative to the V complex amplitude such that the average phase    difference between them is +/-90 degrees (whose sign depends on whether    right- or left-circular polarization was transmitted) under the condition    that the average reflecting surface is specular. The starting position    for relative phase calibration is the set of pre-flight system data,    coupled with in-flight measurements based on the radar's calibration    references (see Amplitude Calibration).  During the mission, relative    phase calibration will be up-dated by radar coverage of the lunar    surface at nadir, from which the observed averaged backscatter should    have known relative phase between the H and the V channels. Any    difference can be inverted to evaluate the relative phase rotation    calibration constant. In addition, the mission plan calls for relative    phase calibration through a cooperative transmission and reception    between the spacecraft and an Earth-based radar observatory. These data    will be posted on the PDS when available. (If more specific information    is needed, please consult the Mini-RF Calibration Plan.)     Operational Modes:   ==================    The Mini-RF instrument has two imaging modes: Synthetic Aperture Radar    (SAR) and Interferometry. The SAR modes, at two wavelengths    (12-cm and 4-cm), each have two resolutions (150 m at 16 looks, and 15m    by 30m at 8 looks). Only one combination of wavelength, and resolution    may be operated at the same time. Data will be gathered on a    non-interference basis with respect to the primary LRO instruments, over    selected sites N/S poleward of plus/minus 80 degrees latitude. SAR    interferometric data takes will be on an as-opportunity-allows basis.     Sensors:   ==========    The radar is primarily a demonstration exercise, to prove the feasibility    of a 15-kg class instrument in lunar orbit to support communications tasks    as well as high-quality imaging data collection.     Electronics:   ============    The Mini-RF assembly consists of two sections, the antenna (a passive array    of H and V elements, of about 1 square meter area), and electronics    (packaged in three individual sub-assemblies).

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:lro.rss,RADIO SCIENCE SUBSYSTEM for LRO,RADIO SCIENCE SUBSYSTEM,"   Instrument Overview ===================   The communication, tracking, and timekeeping systems on LRO support the generation of the precise geolocation needed by the LRO science and measurement investigations.  The information provided by these systems is similar to conventional Radio Science data, although traditional 'radio science' was not an initial mission objective. The importance of the tracking data for all of the other investigations merits its being archived for completeness and future analysis.   Radio Doppler and range tracking to the LRO omnidirectional and high-gain antennas (HGA) provides the main source of the radio science data. The gimbaled HGA also carries a small, coboresighted, optical receiver telescope. One-way time-of-flight from the ground to the optical receiver using laser pulses provides an alternate tracking data type known as Laser Ranging (LR), which is handled jointly by the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) Science Operations Center (SOC) and the Crustal Dynamics Data Information System (CDDIS). The spacecraft Radio Frequency subsystems are described herein and in more detail in [TOOLEYETAL2010]. The LR subsystem is described in [ZUBERETAL2009], and in the LOLA instrument description [SMITHETAL2009]. The ground elements consist of the commercial Universal Space Network (USN), the Ka-band ground station at White Sands, New Mexico (WS1), and the Next Generation Satellite Laser Ranging station in Greenbelt, Maryland (NGSLR).   Additional data were provided by the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) during commissioning. Ongoing participation by the International Laser Ranging Service (ILRS) network of stations provides further LR data that are processed by the LOLA SOC.   Communication Subsystem ----------------------- LRO's communications system consists of an S-band system to provide tracking, telemetry and commanding (TT&C) and a high data rate Ka-band, downlink-only system for telemetry and science data transfers. The S-Band system has a fixed forward link data rate of 4 kbps, and a selectable on-orbit return link data rate between 125 bps and 1093 kbps. It consists of one Spacecraft Tracking and Data Network (STDN) compatible transponder, an S-band Radio Frequency (RF) Switch, and the RF paths to and from the two Omni-Directional antennas and the S- band feed on the High Gain Antenna (HGA).   The transponder downlinks at a frequency which is phase-locked to the uplink, providing two-way Doppler tracking information to the ground with an accuracy of better than 1 mm/s.  It also repeats uplinked range tones with a fixed delay, allowing the ground to determine the distance to the Orbiter within 15 m. The Ka-band system includes a Ka-Band modulator, a Traveling Wave Tube Amplifier (TWTA) consisting of a traveling wave tube (TWT), an Electronic Power Conditioner (EPC), and a High Power Isolator. The Ka-band return link is also selectable on orbit and varies from 25 Mbps to 100 Mbps. Although the Ka-band system uses only the High Gain Antenna, the S-band system can utilize either the Omni-Directional or the High Gain Antenna for transmit and always uses both paths for receiving. The ground selects the uplink path via polarization, as the HGA has opposite polarization from the omni antennas for this reason.  Specifications for each of the S- and Ka-Band subsystems are given in [TOOLEYETAL2010]. In brief, frequency, polarization, and RF transmit power for the spacecraft are:   S-Band System: 2271.2 +/- 2.5 MHz (Transmit), 2091.3967 +/- 2.5 MHz (Receive); Left Hand Circular Polarization (Omni) Right Hand Circular Polarization (HGA) 5.8 Watt Diplexers   Ka-Band System: 25.65 GHz +/- 150 MHz (Transmit) Left Hand Circular Polarization 41.9 Watt TWTA Output   The S-Comm card is designed to accommodate a telemetry interface to Earth using S-Band frequencies. The S-Comm card is connected directly to the Single Board Computer (SBC) via a 10 Mbps SpaceWire link [NGUYENETAL2008]. During a ground station pass the data from the SBC flow directly into the S-Comm card and are encoded for transmission per CCSDS recommendations for telemetry encoding using concatenated encoding. The S-Comm provides one telemetry stream at up to 1.093 Mbps to the transmitter for Bi-Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) modulation onto the RF carrier.The S-Comm accepts uplinked CCSDS telecommands from the S-Band transponder at 4 Kbps. Normally commands are forwarded to the SBC for further processing via the SpaceWire interface unless they are tagged as hardware-decoded commands. Hardware- decoded commands are performed directly by the S-Comm card. The S-Comm card can support up to 8 hardware-decoded commands, 4 of which are RS-422 outputs. Hardware- decoded commands are only used in contingency situations.Both the S-comm and Ka-comm card provide control of the respective Communication Subsystem transmitters via asynchronous low rate serial interfaces.   LRO makes use of a global network of S-band ground stations for nominal spacecraft tracking (at least 30 minutes per orbit) and one Ka-band station for downlink of all the stored instrument and spacecraft data. Nominally, LRO is never be out of contact with the ground for more than one hour at a time. Station-keeping maneuvers and instrument calibrations occur once a month. Momentum management maneuvers occur every 2 weeks. There is an S-band pass every orbit (12 per day), and 4 (on average) Ka-band passes between LRO and WS1 every day, each lasting 45 minutes. The actual number fluctuates between 2 and 6, as the Moon moves through its entire declination range each month (as seen from the Earth). Most of the instruments operate autonomously over the course of a single orbit, while two (LROC and Mini-RF) require daily tailored command timelines. Nominally, LRO receives a new command timeline from the ground once per day that includes tracking schedules and antenna targets.   Ultra Stable Oscillators (USO) ------------------------------ The C&DH subsystem includes both a primary and a redundant USO to provide precision timekeeping onboard the spacecraft. Each oscillator provides two 20-MHz signals. One signal goes to the C&DH HK/IO card and the second goes directly to the LOLA instrument. Only one of the oscillators is powered at any given time. The primary USO has a frequency stability factor of 10 parts per billion (ppb) over one millisecond (ms). It was chosen to provide sufficient stability to meet the needs of the laser ranging system. It receives a +31VDC switched service from the Power Subsystem Electronics (PSE). The redundant USO has a frequency stability factor of 0.3 parts per million (ppm) over one millisecond (ms). It was chosen to provide sufficient stability to meet the needs for LOLA reconstruction of the orbital ephemeris. It receives a +15VDC switched service from the LVPC.   Data Downlink ------------- The LRO flight computer is a RAD-750 processor executing at 133 MHz. Two 100 Gbyte recorders store science data for playback to the earth at 100 Mbps. An S-band system provides command, engineering telemetry, and navigation functions. On a given day, about 460 Gbits of data are generated on-board the LRO spacecraft. Data are downlinked at 100 Mbps through a single Ka-band ground station at White Sands, New Mexico, USA (designated WS1). Even in the worst case (2 passes), there is sufficient time to downlink the entire day's data volume.   Active One-Way Laser Ranging System ----------------------------------- During the preliminary design phase an active one-way (uplink) laser ranging system was added to LRO to improve the tracking, and thus geodetic accuracy of the data products, over that possible with the S-Band tracking system alone.  The elements of the active laser ranging system include a ground station at GSFC, which transmits a 532 nm pulse at 28 Hz. This pulse is captured by the laser ranging telescope mounted on the high gain antenna and then transmitted via fiber optic cable to the LOLA detector assembly. Time-stamped arrival and departure times allow for precise range measurements from Earth to the LRO spacecraft, thus helping to determine precise position relative to the Earth's surface. Those data, combined with known positioning of the spacecraft and LOLA data gathered from the Moon, provide enough information to improve the lunar gravity modeling which can, in turn, be used to improve the orbit determination.   Passive Two-Way Laser Ranging System ------------------------------------ In addition to the active laser ranging system LRO carries a retro-reflector assembly consisting of twelve 1-inch-diameter solid retro-reflective prisms in a square array mounted on the -Z face (zenith radiator). This retro- reflector allows high-power terrestrial laser ranging sites to perform two-way laser ranging to LRO. This ranging is conducted as an experiment of opportunity late in the mission. The HGA must be parked for safety and to provide visibility to the retro-reflector assembly from Earth. As well, the array must point within approximately 20 degrees of Earth, which is only possible for a few days a month while LRO is in mapping configuration.   Ground stations --------------- The baseline tracking system for LRO is an S-band (2.2-2.3 GHZ) radio frequency link for approximately ~20 hours per day [CHINETAL2007].  A commercial network, the Universal Space Network (USN), provides tracking with stations at Dongara, Australia; Kiruna, Sweden; Weilham, Germany; and South Point, Hawaii. The Doppler accuracy of the USN is ~1 mm/s (one sigma) averaged over 10 s, which for the tracking time allocated permits LRO orbits to be determined to approximately ~10 m radially and 300 m along-track and across-track.   Several ILRS stations [PEARLMANETAL2008] participate in the LR investigation as ground stations. The addition of ILRS stations provides global coverage for LR and increases the laser ranging data set. A few of the participating ILRS stations are also synchronizing their laser fires to the LOLA Earth window in a similar manner to NGSLR, while several others are firing asynchronously at 5 or 10 Hz. At 10 Hz only 2 to 4 pulses per second fall in the LOLA Earth window. The remaining 6-8 pulses are treated as noise by LOLA, but these are not enough to cause significant disruptions to the LOLA measurements. Since this is an uplink-only ranging measurement, there is no real-time feedback of spacecraft tracking as in normal SLR operations.  Instead, LOLA's real-time housekeeping telemetry is used to provide needed feedback to the stations. LOLA's onboard signal processing indicates whether the Earth pulses are arriving at LRO, and in addition tracks the time at which these pulses occur within the Earth window. The LOLA Earth energy monitor also provides an integrated energy over each Earth window. This information is posted in graphical form to a password protected website that provides feedback to all participating stations.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:mag.co,DUAL TECHNIQUE MAGNETOMETER for CO,DUAL TECHNIQUE MAGNETOMETER,"     ABSTRACT   ========     The dual technique magnetometer system onboard the Cassini orbiter is     described. This instrument consists of vector helium and fluxgate     magnetometers with the capability to operate the helium device in a scalar     mode. This special mode is used near the planet in order to determine with     very high accuracy the interior field of the planet. The four-year orbiting     Cassini mission will lead to a detailed understanding of the Saturn/Titan     system. In addition to the prime scientific measurement of the planetary     field, the instrument will also make measurements of the planetary     magnetosphere, and the interactions of Saturn with the solar wind, of Titan     with its environments, and of the icy satellites within the magnetosphere.     INSTRUMENT DESCRIPTION   ======================     The MAG instrument comprises a fluxgate magnetometer (FGM) and a     vector helium magnetometer capable of operating in both vector and     scalar mode (V/SHM). The instrument is intended to measure small     changes in fields spanning four orders of magnitude with extremely     high sensitivity. This goal is achieved in part by mounting the     sensors on an 11-metre spacecraft boom; the V/SHM at the end of the     boom, the FGM halfway along. The magnetometer boom distances the     sensors from the magnetic field associated with the spacecraft and     its subsystems, and especially from spacecraft-generated temporal     field variations. Spacing the sensors at different distances along     the boom allows the spacecraft fields to be better characterised and     removed from the observations. However, mounting the sensors on a     boom could result in their orientation with respect to the     spacecraft axes changing from time to time, for example after     spacecraft manoeuvres. A means of sensor-alignment determination has     been provided by the Cassini project - the Science CAlibration     Subsystem, SCAS. This system consists of two, perpendicular, coils     rigidly mounted on the spacecraft body with a known alignment to the     spacecraft axes. These coils produce well-defined magnetic fields on     command which can be detected by the sensors and used to correct for     any changes in sensor orientation.       Both magnetometers are capable of measuring the magnetic-field     vector at rates from 0 Hz up to 10 Hz (VHM) or at least 30 Hz (FGM).     The VHM optimises low-frequency vector measurements in weak fields.     The FGM is best suited to high-frequency measurements and can     operate over an extremely wide dynamic range, from very weak fields     up to Earth's strong field.       The twin-sensor configuration contributes to overall instrument     reliability; if one sensor fails, field measurements can be made     with the other sensor, with sufficient performance to achieve many     of the major objectives of the investigation. Reliability has been     further increased by the provision of redundant instrument power     supplies and data processing units, and by careful selection of     electronic components that can survive the radiation environments     encountered during the long cruise phase of the mission and in the     Saturnian system. The VHM provides the stability needed to maintain     calibrations, obtained in the solar wind, whilst Cassini is inside     the Saturnian magnetosphere for long periods during the four-year     tour.       An implicit feature of scalar or resonance magnetometers are null     zones which arise if the ambient field falls outside a cone of 45     degrees half angle with respect to the optical axis of the     magnetometer. These null zones result in the signal being     dramatically weakened, causing the absolute accuracy of the     instrument to suffer. When Cassini is inside 4 RS a requirement has     been placed on the mission to avoid spacecraft orientations which     cause the planetary field to lie within the null zones of the SHM.       Other features of the instrument that have been driven by the     characteristics of the mission and by the design of the spacecraft     are to be found in the data processing unit (DPU). The DPU contains     a bus interface unit (BIU), provided by the Cassini project for     interfacing to the onboard data handling subsystem (CDS) bus. In     line with the spacecraft design, the DPU is capable of handling     Packet Telemetry and Telecommands, and features a flexible telemetry     storage and generation scheme to support the multiple telemetry     modes of the spacecraft. The Tour operations concept requires that     the DPU is able to handle trigger commands which initiate multiple     actions within the instrument (macro commanding). Further, in order     to optimise the analysis of discrete events such as shock crossings,     a snapshot capability has been implemented by which up to 16 Mbytes     of data can be stored for later downlink at higher time resolution     than normal. This capability can be initiated by command or     triggered by pre-defined events.       Magnetic-field information is also needed by other investigations on     the spacecraft. To this end magnetic-field data are made available     to onboard users every second. These onboard ancillary data are raw     and uncalibrated vectors, the data source being selectable by     command between the two sensors.       In total, the instrument consists of the two boom-mounted sensors,     subchassis #1 (an assembly containing electronics for the FGM, VHM     and SHM, the heater-control electronics, the power supplies and     power-management system) and subchassis #2 (an assembly containing     the data processing unit). Both subchassis are mounted in bay 4 of     the Orbiter upper equipment module (UEM). The instrument     ground-support equipment was provided by KFKI and TUB.       Table I lists the main characteristics of the instrument. Power and     data-rate values vary according to instrument mode. The values given     in the table are for the delivered flight model where power values     include power drawn by the Cassini-provided BIU.

A cable of approximately 6.5-meter       length runs along the boom between sensor and electronics. A high       efficiency, tuned drive design of the electronics has been chosen       to reduce power consumption and the effect of cable loading.         The FGM is similar to the Imperial College instrument flown on       Ulysses, and to many others flown on numerous missions. It is       based on three single-axis ring-core fluxgate sensors mounted       orthogonally on a machinable glass ceramic block. Ceramic is       chosen for its low thermal expansion coefficient, minimising       misalignments between sensors due to temperature changes. In each       sensor, a drive coil is wound around a high-permeability ring-core       which is completely enclosed in a sense winding. The drive coil is       driven by a crystal-controlled 15.625 kHz square wave which is       used to generate a magnetic field that drives the core into       saturation twice per cycle. The three drive coils are connected in       series to simplify the cabling and circuitry. The presence of an       ambient magnetic-field component parallel to the axis of the sense       coil causes the saturation of the core to become asymmetrical.       This asymmetry induces a second harmonic of the drive frequency in       the sense coil which is proportional to the magnitude of the       magnetic-field component along that axis. The signal is processed       through a narrow band amplifier tuned to the second harmonic of       the drive frequency, which attenuates harmonics other than the       second. The result is integrated, converted to a current and fed       back to the sensor coil to null the ambient field. The integrated       output voltage, amplified and corrected for scale factor and       alignment errors, is proportional to the ambient field. The three       analogue vector components are passed to the DPU for analogue to       digital conversion and data processing. The noise performance of       the FGM, measured on the ground at the analogue output of the       electronics, is better than 5 pT/Hz at 1 Hz. The electronics can       be checked in flight using an in-flight calibration (IFC)       capability built into the electronics and controlled by command       from the DPU. The IFC applies a fixed offset to each of the three       vector outputs corresponding to a signal of approximately 10 nT.       The frequency, number of on/off cycles, of the IFC is selectable       by command.         Changing the electronics feedback path and the output       amplification allows the sensor to be operated in one of four       different full scale magnetic field ranges, as listed in Table I.       The largest range (+/-44,000 nT) was included mainly for ground       testing in the Earth's field. Switching between ranges in normal       operations is automatic, controlled by the DPU. If the magnitude       of any of the FGM magnetic-field components exceeds an upper       threshold for more than a specified number of samples, the DPU       will switch the FGM to a higher range. Similarly, if all three       component value magnitudes fall below a lower threshold for more       than a specified number of samples, the DPU will switch the FGM to       a lower range. All parameters are modifiable by command and       autoranging can also be disabled and manual range changes       commanded.         A 1W heater has been provided to maintain the FGM within its       operating temperature range of -30 to +50 degrees C. The specially       designed, non-magnetic unit is mounted on the ceramic sensor block       and has control electronics on Subchassis#1. Further thermal       control is provided by an aluminised mylar-covered fibreglass case       over the sensor block and by three, project-provided, radioactive       heater units mounted at equal distances around the base of the       sensor (these units provide a total of 3W).         THE V/SHM     ---------       The V/SHM sensor is the flight-spare Ulysses vector-helium       magnetometer sensor with an added small pair of coils nested       inside the larger Helmholtz coils used in the vector mode. The       sensor is mounted at the end of the 11-meter magnetometer boom. A       set of cables running the length of the boom connects it to the       VHM and SHM electronics on Subchassis#1. The VHM electronics box       is also the Ulysses flight-spare unit with small modifications to       change the sensor operating ranges and to compensate for the       different boom cable lengths. A new electronics board has been       added to Subchassis#1 containing the electronics to operate in the       scalar mode.         The operation of the magnetometer is based on field-dependent       light absorption (the Zeeman effect) and optical pumping to sense       the magnetic field. Helium in an absorption cell is excited by a       radio-frequency (RF) discharge to maintain a population of       metastable long-lived atoms. Infrared radiation (wavelength 1083       nm) from a helium lamp, also generated by RF excitation, passes       through a circular polariser and the absorption cell to an       infrared detector. The absorption (pumping efficiency) of the       helium in the cell is dependent on the ambient magnetic-field       direction. The optical pumping efficiency is proportional to       cos^2(Theta) where Theta is the angle between the optical axis and       the direction of the magnetic field. This directional dependence       is utilised in the vector mode by applying low-frequency sweep       fields rotating about the cell which allow the extraction of the       three orthogonal ambient-field components. These fields are fed       back using a set of triaxial Helmholtz coils mounted on the sensor       housing around the cell. In the scalar mode, the directional       dependence results in a 'field of view' restricted to a cone with       half angle approximately 45 degrees, centred on the optical axis       detector.         Changing the VHM sweep fields allows the sensor to operate in       different ranges. Two VHM ranges have been selected for Cassini       (see Table I). As for the FGM, automatic ranging has been       implemented in the DPU. The VHM electronics also have an internal       autoranging capability (used for the Ulysses instrument). A single       range has been implemented for the SHM. Injection of known       currents into the Helmholtz-coil system provide an in-flight       calibration (IFC) capability. The calibration fields apply an       offset of approximately 1/8 of the full scale range to each vector       component. A non-magnetic proportional heater using up to 2W is       incorporated into the V/SHM sensor and is controlled from       electronics built into the VHM electronics box on Subchassis#1.       The operating temperature range of the sensor is -10 to +40       degrees C.         In the scalar mode, a weak AC field at the Larmor frequency, which       opposes the optical pumping, is applied to the cell. This field       causes a reduction in the transmitted light  detected by the IR       detector. The Larmor frequency, which is proportional to the       ambient magnetic field, is measured. In order to track the ambient       field the applied field is frequency modulated so that the       detector output contains a signal component harmonically related       to the modulation frequency. The proportionality constant is the       gyromagnetic ratio which for helium is 28.023561 Hz/nT. Detection       and measurement of the Larmor frequency leads to a very accurate       measurement of the ambient field magnitude. The result is passed       as a 20-bit scalar word from the SHM electronics to the DPU. A       more detailed description of the V/SHM may be found in Kellock et       al. (1996).  Smith et al. (2001) provides a detailed description       of the SHM operation and observations from the Earth Swingby in       August 1999.       INSTRUMENT ELECTRONICS   ======================     The instrument electronics are all mounted in the Upper Equipment     Module in bay 4 and are split between two subchassis assemblies.     Subchassis#1 contains the sensor electronics, the power supplies and     power management system, as well as the heater control and     instrument housekeeping electronics; its mass is given in Table I.     On the underside of the subchassis are the power-management board,     the FGM electronics board and the SHM electronics board. The     power-management board contains a total of 14 non-latching power     switches and cross-strapping circuitry for the two redundant     secondary power supplies. The top side of the subchassis contains     the VHM electronics box, two small boards to the left of the VHM box     with latching relays to switch between VHM and SHM operation, two     redundant secondary power supplies (PSU1 and PSU2), a dedicated BIU     power supply (PSU0), and the FGM heater-control electronics and     housekeeping circuitry. Proportional control electronics for the VHM     heater are located within the VHM box. The power supplies and     switches are Imperial College designs used on previous missions and     feature built-in overcurrent trips.       The basic power distribution scheme is described in Kellock et al.     (1996). Power switches for the secondary voltage lines are     controlled by the active processing unit and power switches for the     power supplies and processing units themselves are controlled by     discrete commanding from the spacecraft via the BIU and the Common     Core (CC).       Subchassis#2 contains the DPU, consisting of two redundant processor     systems plus a small CC and the BIU. When power is first supplied     from the spacecraft, only the BIU and the CC become active, powered     from PSU0. The BIU allows data transfer to and from the spacecraft,     the CC processes commands and data for power up of the secondary     power supplies (PSU1 or PSU2) and the processors (PUA or PUB). Each     processor system is based on an 80C86 processor with 4-MHz clock,     32-kByte PROM, 128-kByte Hi-Rel RAM and 16-MByte state-of-the-art     commercial DRAM. The systems normally operate singly but can be     operated in parallel. A high-accuracy 16-bit analogue to digital     converter (ADC) is integrated into each processor system for sensor     data collection. Two ADC clock speeds are available, 1 MHz and 2     MHz, the former being the default speed. Tantalum shielding has been     used for the ADCs, DRAMs and Operational Amplifiers to reduce their     susceptibility to radiation.  The DPU boards are folded around the     subchassis. The electronic components face the subchassis, because     the 2.4 mm thick 16-layer boards provide additional radiation     shielding. The Sensor Interface Board is on the right hand side.     The flexible connection board goes through subchassis cutouts to the     Processor Board on the other side. The JPL-provided BIU, plus its     associated cabling, is located on the left side.       To satisfy the demands of a deep-space mission with limited     communications, the DPU has been designed with a large measure of     autonomy and sophisticated data-handling functions. These functions     include the following: telecommand handling, sensor autoranging and     IFC, sensor data collection, sensor data processing, snapshot data     handling, telemetry generation, error correction, fault detection     and recovery, and onboard ancillary data generation. Some of the     functions of the DPU are described below.       The DPU is designed to handle both the packet telecommand standard     adopted by Cassini, used for normal commanding, and discrete     telecommands used when the processor is not active. A variety of     command functions are supported and are discussed later. The DPU     must be able to accept telecommands at all times, in all operational     modes. Commands may be for immediate execution, or can contain     relative or absolute timetags for delayed execution (relative     timetags cause execution at a fixed time with respect to reception     of the command, absolute timetags cause execution at specific     spacecraft times). As noted earlier, a macro commanding capability     has been implemented whereby sequences of instrument commands can be     stored in the DPU and the sequence started by executing a macro     command.       Hamming single-bit error correction and double-bit error detection     is provided for all memory devices except those in the BIU. Single     Event Upsets (SEUs) can change the content of memory cells, cyclic     access to every memory cell corrects single-bit and reduces the risk     of double-bit errors. Memory scrubbing is initiated every 64 seconds     in the Hi-Rel RAM and the 16-MByte, multi-snapshot, DRAM. It takes     about 1 hour to scrub the complete RAM. Additional memory checks     can be initiated by command: occurences of single and double-bit     errors are monitored. The PROMS are checked separately and contain     a pre-defined error pattern for detection. If a permanent RAM     problem arises, the DPU can be commanded to run its software     directly from PROM. In-flight tests have also been implemented for     the ADC to check the noise and conversion and settling times on each     analogue channel.       Both processor systems contain four separate dual-level latch-up     detectors, one for the processor, one for the multi-snapshot memory,     and one each for the ADC +/-12V supply voltages. Detectors of     similar design have been flown on the GEOTAIL, WIND and SOHO     spacecraft. If a latch up is detected in the processor, it will be     immediately switched off and on again and the instrument will be     automatically reconfigured into its previous mode. Latch ups in     either the memory or the ADC will cause it to be immediately     switched off and back on again. There is also a hardware watchdog     function in the DPU which will detect problems in the DPU program     flow and which initiates a hardware reset followed by an automatic     instrument reconfiguration.

The rover software issues a start imaging command (that includes the frame rate and the number of frames; substantial margin is commanded to take into account unusually long descent durations) and the camera operates thereafter autonomously. The data are written into permanent flash memory in real time during acquisition for later transmission.  Hundreds of images will be acquired at scales many times greater than available from orbit. The MARDI science investigation primary objectives are to determine where exactly the MSL vehicle has landed and to provide a geologic and engineering-geologic framework of the landing site for early operations. The rover is expected to leave the area imaged by MARDI after the first few weeks of the mission. Vehicle horizontal offset between images within the descent sequence may permit digital elevation models (DEMs) to be created from the descent images. Additional objectives of the investigation are to examine vehicle ground-referenced motion deviations from inertial measurement unit (IMU) derived inertial position during descent to extract wind velocity from the lower boundary layer, and to help develop and test algorithms for future autonomous landing and hazard avoidance systems.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:mcdonald.struve2m1.molp,McDonald Observatory Linear Polarimeter,McDonald Observatory Linear Polarimeter,"The Linear Polarimeter was put into service at McDonald Observatory in 1978.  The main element is a Glan-Air prism, rapidly rotating to counteract atmospheric transparency fluctuations.  The Glan prism was chosen as an analyzer due to its very high throughput, achromatic nature, optical precision, and low cost.  A slight disadvantage results from the presence of an air gap inside the prism and the resultant lateral image displacement (less than 0.1mm).  A slight image rotation causes an instrumental polarization of 0.05% which varies slightly with wavelength, is constant in time, and can easily be subtracted out.  Other sources of instrumental polarization, including the aluminized telescope mirrors, have turned out to be less than 10^-4.  Tests have shown that under ideal observing conditions, the polarimeter can measure accurately to a precision on the order 10^-4.  In practice, therefore, the precision of the polarimeter is limited by photon statistics.  For more information about the instrument, including a schematic diagram, see Breger (1979).

The campaign began in 1986 with the Pressure Modulator Infrared Radiometer (PMIRR) on the Mars Observer mission, which was lost in 1993 during the final pressurization of the spacecraft propulsion system only a few days prior to Mars orbit insertion (MOI). NASA re-selected that scientific investigation, including an enlarged science team and using the same PMIRR instrument design, for another mission, the Mars Climate Orbiter (MCO). Launched in 1998, the MCO spacecraft entered the Martian atmosphere during MOI and was destroyed. NASA selected the same team once more to build the new MCS instrument now onboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). MCS is not a copy of the PMIRR instrument launched in 1992, as the 1998 PMIRR II was, but is a smaller, lighter instrument with the same scientific objectives as those of the previous two investigations. The Mars Climate Sounder is the first custom designed infrared sounder for systematic meteorological measurements at Mars, using the limb viewing technique to obtain relatively high vertical resolution of better than one pressure scale height. The application of modern technology and the use of new high performance, linear array thermopile detectors with focal plane signal processing and miniature multilayer interference and mesh filters has permitted a fivefold reduction in mass, in part by the elimination of the requirement for cryogenic operation of the focal plane. The compact dimensions of the design allow the entire instrument to be pointed to limb or nadir, for atmospheric and surface mapping respectively, and special patterns to be implemented, for example for mapping over the poles where the complex physics of the energy balance and atmospheric response during the long winter night is to be addressed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These are types 4 (CME_STATUS), 5 (POWER_DATA), and 6 (TABLES). Type 4 is a direct response from the FPGA that controls all aspects of MECA operations. The most common usage of this telemetry type is as a reply to routine requests including turning on LEDs for imaging, moving the microscope sample stage, deploying a chemistry actuator (sample drawer, water release, or stirring motor), or simply a status inquiry. The data return provides not only confirmation that the requested operation occurred, but specific information necessary for calibration, such as the position of the stage when the atomic force microscope is engaged. A second usage of this telemetry type is in response to a 'raw' command, a direct instruction to the FPGA to execute any of its allowed functions. While not recommended for routine science measurements, this mode is often used for operations that are not performed in the desired sequence by the standard flight software commands. Notably, this may include voltammetry and potentiometry measurements in the chemistry cells, in which case the Type 4 return contains primary science data. Type 5 data returns the voltage and current provided by the primary MECA 5V (load and logic) and 15V (load and AFM) power supplies. These results are diagnostic of the functioning of all subsystems and should be indicative of many anomalous conditions. Type 6 data returns, on request, the contents of any of six tables that modify the operation of the MECA flight software (FSW). These include a state table which is autonomously maintained by FSW as well as several tables that can only be set by explicit user command. These user-maintained tables contain the values and allowed ranges of parameters and attributes that define the implementation of each experiment. For microscopy, for example, they might define the different substrate positions on the sample wheel as well as the optimal focus position.

The radar dimensions       were 0.304 by 1.35 by 0.902 (height by length by width in       meters) and the mass was 126.1 kg.

Instrument Overview     ===================       The Magellan radar system included a 3.7 m diameter high gain       antenna (HGA) for SAR and radiometry and a smaller fan-beam       antenna (ALTA) for altimetry.  The system operated at 12.6 cm       wavelength.  Common electronics were used in SAR, altimetry,       and radiometry modes.  The SAR operated in a burst mode;       altimetry and radiometry observations were interleaved with the       SAR bursts.         Between SAR bursts (typically several times a second) groups of       altimeter pulses were transmitted from a dedicated fan-beam       altimeter antenna directed toward the spacecraft's nadir.  The       altimeter pulses were identical in waveform and bandwidth to       the SAR pulses, resulting in a range accuracy of better than 15       m.  The pulse-repetition rate and burst duration differed       between the two modes.         Radiometry data were obtained by spending a portion of the time       between SAR bursts and after altimeter operation in a passive       (receive-only) mode, with the HGA antenna capturing the       microwave thermal emission from the planet.  Noise power within       the 10-MHz receiver bandwidth was detected and accumulated for       50 ms.  To reduce the sensitivity to receiver gain changes in       this mode, the receiver was connected on alternate bursts first       to a comparison dummy load at a known physical temperature and       then to the HGA.  The short-term temperature resolution was       about 2 K; the long-term absolute accuracy after calibration       was about 20 K.         Science Objectives     ==================       See MISSION_OBJECTIVES_SUMMARY under MISSION.         Operational Considerations     ==========================       The Magellan radar system was used to acquire radar       back-scatter (SAR) images, altimetry, and radiometry when the       spacecraft was close to the planet.  Nominal operation extended       from about 20 minutes before periapsis until about 20 minutes       after periapsis.  In the SAR mode output from the radar       receiver was sampled, blocks of samples were quantized using an       adaptive procedure, and the results were stored on tape.  In       the altimetry mode samples were recorded directly, without       quantization.  Radiometry measurements were stored in the radar       header records.  During most of the remainder of each orbit,       the HGA was pointed toward Earth and the contents of the tape       recorder were transmitted to a station of the DSN at       approximately 270 kilobits/second.  SAR, altimetry, and       radiometry data were then processed using ground software into       images, altimetry profiles, estimates of backscatter       coefficient, emissivity, and other quantities.         Calibration Description     =======================       The radar was calibrated before flight using an active       electronic target simulator [CUEVAS1989].         Platform Mounting Descriptions     ==============================       The spacecraft +Z axis vector was in the nominal direction of       the HGA boresight.  The +X axis vector was parallel to the       nominal rotation axis of the solar panels.  The +Y axis vector       formed a right-handed coordinate system and was in the nominal       direction of the star scanner boresight.  The spacecraft       velocity vector was in approximately the -Y direction when the       spacecraft was oriented for left-looking SAR operation.  The       nominal HGA polarization was linear in the y-direction.         Cone Offset Angle              : 0.00       Cross Cone Offset Angle        : 0.00       Twist Offset Angle             : 0.00         The altimetry antenna boresight was in the x-z plane 25 degrees       from the +Z direction and 65 degrees from the +X direction.       The altimetry antenna was aimed approximately toward nadir       during nominal radar operation.  The altimetry antenna       polarization was linear in the y-direction.         The medium gain antenna boresight was 70 degrees from the +Z       direction and 20 degrees from the -Y direction.  The low gain       antenna was mounted on the back of the HGA feed; it's boresight       was in the +Z direction and it had a hemispherical radiation       pattern.         Principal Investigator     ======================       The Principal Investigator for the radar instrument was Gordon       H. Pettengill.         Instrument Section / Operating Mode Descriptions     ================================================       The Magellan radar system consisted of the following sections,       each of which operated in the following modes:         Section      Mode       -------------------------------------------       SAR          Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)       ALT          Altimetry       RAD          Radiometry           (1) SAR Characteristics       -----------------------         In the Synthetic Aperture Radar mode, the radar transmitted         bursts of phase-modulated pulses through its high gain         antenna.  Echo signals were captured by the antenna, sampled         at the receiver output, and stored on tape after being         quantized to reduce data volume.  Pulse repetition rate and         incidence angle were chosen to meet a minimum signal-to-noise         ratio requirement (8 dB) for image pixels after ground         processing.  Multiple looks were used in processing to reduce         speckle noise.  Incidence angles varied from about 13 degrees         at the pole to about 44 degrees at periapsis during normal         mapping operations (e.g., Cycle 1); but other 'look angle         profiles' were used during the mission.

Output from the radar receiver was sampled, and the         samples were stored on tape for transmission to Earth.         During nominal left-looking SAR operation the ALTA pointed         approximately 20 deg to the left of the spacecraft ground         track at periapsis and about 10 deg to the right of the         ground track near the north and south pole.

Noise power within the 10-MHz         receiver bandwidth was detected and accumulated for 50 ms.         To reduce the sensitivity to receiver gain changes in this         mode, the receiver was connected on alternate bursts first to         a comparison dummy load at a known physical temperature and         then to the HGA.  The short-term temperature resolution was         about 2 K; the long-term absolute accuracy after calibration         was about 20 K.  At several times during the mission,         radiometry measurements were carried out using known cosmic         radio sources.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:mgn.rss,RADIO SCIENCE SUBSYSTEM for MGN,RADIO SCIENCE SUBSYSTEM,"       Instrument Overview     ===================       The Magellan Radio Science investigations utilized       instrumentation with elements on the spacecraft and at the       DSN.  Much of this is shared equipment, being used for       routine telecommunications as well as for Radio Science.       The performance and calibration of both the spacecraft and       tracking stations directly affect the radio science data       accuracy, and they play a major role in determining the       quality of the results.  The spacecraft part of the radio       science instrument is described immediately below; that is       followed by a description of the DSN (ground) part of the       instrument.         Instrument Specifications - Spacecraft     ======================================       The Magellan spacecraft telecommunications subsystem served       as part of a radio science subsystem for investigations of       Venus.  Many details of the subsystem are unknown; its       'build date' is taken to be 1989-01-01, which was during       the prelaunch phase of the Magellan mission.         Instrument Id                  : RSS       Instrument Host Id             : MGN       Pi Pds User Id                 : UNK       Instrument Name                : RADIO SCIENCE SUBSYSTEM       Instrument Type                : RADIO SCIENCE       Build Date                     : 1989-01-01       Instrument Mass                : 102.2 KG       Instrument Length              : UNK       Instrument Width               : UNK       Instrument Height              : UNK       Instrument Manufacturer Name   : UNK         Instrument Overview - Spacecraft     ================================       The spacecraft radio system was constructed around a redundant pair       of NASA S-band Standard Transponders (NSTs).  In front of the S-band       transponders was a single cross-strapped X-band down-converter, which       allowed the NST to receive and transmit at both S-band (2.3 GHz,       13 cm wavelength) and X-band (8.4 GHz, 3.6 cm wavelength) frequencies.       The X-band capability reduced plasma effects on radio signals by a       factor of 10 and significantly improved the quality of radio tracking       data for gravity investigations.  The exact transmitted frequency was       controlled by the signal received from a ground station or by an       on-board oscillator.  Each transponder included a receiver, command       detector, exciter, and low-power amplifier.  The transponders       provided the usual uplink command and downlink data transmission       capabilities.         The spacecraft was capable of either S- or X-band uplink       for commanding and simultaneous S- and X-band downlink for       telemetry.  The NST generated a downlink signal in either a       'coherent' or a 'non-coherent' mode, also known as the 'two-       way' and 'one-way' modes, respectively.  When operating       in the coherent mode, the NST behaved as a conventional       transponder; its transmitted carrier frequency was derived       coherently from the received uplink carrier frequency with a       'turn-around ratio' of 880/749 at X-band and 240/221 at       S-band.  When the X-band downlink was controlled by an       S-band uplink, the turn-around ratio was (240/221)*(11/3).         In the non-coherent mode, the downlink carrier frequency was derived       from one of the spacecraft's on-board crystal-controlled oscillators.       After a 3-hour warm-up, the 'local' oscillator frequency was estimated       to be 8425.864 +/- 0.002  MHz at X-band; the S-band signal was lower       by a factor  3/11.  Auxiliary Oscillator A was judged to have slightly       better stability.  During bistatic radar experiments in May-June       1994 it served as the frequency reference.  After a 1.5 hour warm-up       (first orbit, T=41C) its X-band frequency was estimated to be       8425.831 +/- 0.002 MHz; during subsequent orbits (T=43.3C) its       frequency was estimated to be 8425.827+/-0.002 MHz.  These frequencies       depended primarily on the thermal environment, which could range       over  43C < T < 45C  after initial warm-up.  Sensitivity of Auxiliary       Oscillator A to thermal changes was -1.9 kHz per degree C.         The strength of a spacecraft carrier signal, and thus the       quality of the radio science data, depends on its modulation       state.  Magellan radar data were sent to Earth at a nominal       rate of 268.8 kilobits per second at X-band; S-band was used       for transmission of engineering data at 1.2 kilobits per       second.  Backup data rates of 115.2 kilobits for radar data       and 40 bits per second for engineering were available for       special contingencies and were required frequently during       later phases of the mission.         Traveling wave tube amplifiers, driven at saturation,       amplified the NST output before the signals were radiated       via (nominally) a 3.7 m diameter parabolic high gain antenna       (HGA).  The same antenna was used for the on-board Synthetic       Aperture Radar (SAR) system.  Medium-gain and low-gain       antennas (MGA and LGA, respectively) were also provided.         The S-band signal transmitted by the Magellan HGA was       linearly polarized.  For radar operation, the nominal S-band       polarization was linear in the y-direction of the spacecraft       coordinate system (HH on the surface).  For telecommunications       (and radio science) the S-band polarization was linear in the       x-direction.  The X-band signal transmitted by the HGA was       circularly polarized, with the sense of polarization depending       on the transponder connected.         More information can be found in the Magellan Spacecraft Final       Report [MGN-MA-011-1995].         Science Objectives     ==================       Two different types of radio science experiments were       conducted with Magellan: radio tracking experiments in which       the magnitude and direction of the planet's gravity field       were derived from the Doppler (and, sometimes, ranging)       measurements, and radio propagation experiments in which       signal modulation detected on Earth could be       attributed to properties of the medium.  Several variations       of the radio propagation experiments were carried out       including radio occultations by the atmosphere of Venus and       scattering from its surface.  Polarization and       scintillation measurements were also obtained when the radio       wave passed through the solar corona.           Gravity Measurements       --------------------         Measurement of the gravity field provides significant         constraints on inferences about the interior structure of         Venus.  Precise, detailed study of the spacecraft motion         in Venus orbit can yield constraints on the mass         distribution of the planet.  Topographic data obtained by         the Magellan Altimeter (ALT) forms a critical adjunct to         these measurements since only after the gravitational         effects are adjusted for topography can the gravity         anomalies be interpreted geophysically.           Studies of the gravity field emphasize both the global         field and local characteristics of the field.  The first         task is to determine the global field.  Doppler and range         tracking measurements yield accurate spacecraft trajectory         solutions.  Simultaneously with reconstruction of the         spacecraft orbit, observation equations for field         coefficients and a small number of ancillary parameters         can be solved.  This type of gravity field solution is         essential for characterizing tectonic phenomena and can         also be used to study localized features.           'Short-arc' line-of-sight Doppler tracking measurements         obtained when the Earth-to-spacecraft line-of-sight is         within a few degrees of the orbit plane provide the         highest resolution of local features.  The results from         this type of observation typically are presented as         contoured acceleration profiles of specific features         (e.g., craters, volcanoes, etc.) or line-of-sight         acceleration maps of specific regions.  The high spatial         resolution of these products makes them especially useful         to geophysicists for study of features in the size range         of 100 to 1,000 km.  Because of the relative simplicity         of the data analysis, results can be available within a         few weeks after the data are collected.           The gravity investigation has been described in more detail         by [KONOPLIV&SJOGREN1996] and [KONOPLIVETAL1999].           Radio Occultation Measurements       ------------------------------         Atmospheric measurements by the method of radio         occultation contribute to an improved understanding of         structure, circulation, dynamics, and transport in the         atmosphere of Venus.  These results are based on detailed         analysis of the radio signal received from Magellan as it         enters and exits occultation by the planet.  Two phases         of the atmospheric investigation may be defined.  The         first is to obtain vertical profiles of atmospheric         structure with emphasis on investigation of large-scale         phenomena.  The second is to concentrate on studies of         the absorption at various levels in the atmosphere         (absorption correlates with concentration of sulfuric         acid vapor).           Retrieval of atmospheric profiles requires coherent         samples of the radio signal that has propagated through         the atmosphere, plus accurate knowledge of the antenna         pointing and the spacecraft trajectory.  The latter is         obtained from the Magellan Navigation Team.  Initial         solutions from Magellan occultations provided atmospheric         structure -- temperature and pressure vs. absolute radius         -- to altitudes as low as about 35 km from the surface.         The atmosphere becomes critically refracting at levels         only a short distance lower, so these results represent         very nearly the maximum depth achievable using radio         occultation probing.           The spatial and temporal coverage in the radio occultation         experiments are determined by the geometry of the         spacecraft orbit and the dates and times at which         occultation data were acquired.  Since radio occultation         experiments were conducted on an ad hoc basis, the         Magellan coverage is sparse.           Bistatic Surface Scattering Measurements       ----------------------------------------         The spacecraft telecommunications antenna can also be         pointed toward the surface of the planet.  The strength         of the scattered signal from the illuminated area may         then be interpreted in terms of the texture of the surface         at that point.  In an experiment conducted on 6 October         1993, the Magellan high-gain antenna was aimed toward the         summit of Gula Mons and the scattered signal was measured         at DSN stations in California and Australia. On 9 November         1993, the high-gain antenna was aimed toward the (moving)         point on the surface which would give mirror-like         reflection toward Earth; those signals were received at         the DSN station in Spain.  In May and June 1994 experiments         were conducted over Maxwell Montes; those data were         processed to give the polarization of the reflected signal,         which can lead to estimates of complex dielectric constant         of the surface material.  Results were published by         [PETTENGILLETAL1996].           Solar Scintillation and Faraday Rotation Experiments       ----------------------------------------------------         Solar scintillation and Faraday rotation experiments are conducted         to improve our understanding of the structure and dynamics of the         solar corona and wind.  Because Venus orbits the Sun, spacecraft like         Magellan are transported behind the solar disk, as seen from Earth.         Radio waves propagating between Magellan and Earth stations are         refracted and scattered (scintillation) by the solar plasma [WOO1993].         Intensity fluctuations can be related to fluctuations in electron         density along the path, while Doppler or phase scintillations can         be related to both electron density fluctuations and also the         speed of the solar wind.  The plane of linearly polarized waves can         be rotated if there is an accompanying magnetic field (Faraday         rotation).  Many plasma effects decrease as the square of the radio         frequency; scintillations are about an order of magnitude stronger         at S-band than X-band.  But only Magellan's S-band radio system         used linear polarization; the circularly polarized X-band system         was essentially immune to Faraday rotation.         Operational Considerations - Spacecraft     =======================================       Descriptions given here are for nominal performance.  The       spacecraft transponder system comprised redundant units,       each with slightly different characteristics.  As       transponder units age, their performance changes slightly.       More importantly, the performance for radio science depended       on operational factors such as the modulation state for the       transmitters, which cannot be predicted in advance.  The       performance also depended on factors which were not always       under the control of the  Magellan Project.  The sample       design control table below is adapted from [BUROW1986] for       the X-band link carrying 268.8 kbps telemetry.  Mean and       variance denote expectations after accounting for best and       worst case variations on design values.

We were unable to contact the author and confirm his intent.             A plausible explanation is that the design value should be             -1.03, reflecting performance loss from antenna pointing             errors, while the -0.65 mean represents a more favorable             expectation after further design study.  The specific values             are not crucial to interpretation of these radio science data.         On 4 January 1992 at 15:39 UTC, after a star calibration on       orbit 3880, the X-band telemetry and high-rate science data       did not reappear in the Magellan downlink.  After several       configuration changes and diagnostic tests, the Spacecraft       Team reached the preliminary conclusion that a summing       amplifier in Transponder-A had failed.  This summing       amplifier combined the X-band engineering and science       telemetry signals before phase-modulation, amplification,       and transmission of the signal to Earth via the High-Gain       Antenna.   As part of the testing on 4 January,       Transponder-B was turned on and substituted for       Transponder-A for about 25 minutes.  Transponder-B had been       turned off on 13 March 1991 when it developed a spurious       sideband that masked the data subcarriers.  The spurious       signal appeared several MHz above the carrier frequency at       X-band, sometimes containing more power than the carrier.       During the short test on 4 January, Transponder-B started       out at 28-deg C and transmitted good data to Earth.  Later       it warmed to 34-deg C and the downlink signal degraded.       The probable failure mechanism of Transponder-B was       determined to be a cracked, failed capacitor.  Informal       Spacecraft Team contacts with Motorola on 6 January       indicated that Transponder-B might be returned to use if it       were operated with little or no thermal cycling.  That       strategy was adopted for most of the remainder of the       mission.  Use of the 115.2 kbs science data rate allowed       reception of radar data on Earth through most of that time       despite presence of the spur, but the mapping time on each       orbit was reduced commensurate with the playback       capabilities.  Both Transponder-A and -B could support       gravity observations in their degraded states.  Both       transponders had strong X-band carriers in spite of their       failures.  The existence of the spur also affected radio       propagation observations to the extent that carrier power       was reduced to between a tenth and a half of its nominal level when       Transponder-B was in use.  Over time periods of an orbit,       the frequency and strength of the spur did not change       appreciably; so a calibration of carrier level at one point       in the orbit was sufficient to establish carrier level       during other parts of the orbit.         For the bistatic surface scattering observations in October and       November 1993, estimates of transmitted power and spur parameters were       derived from spacecraft engineering telemetry and ground measurements.       The total power at S-band was 4.188+/-0.025 watts; the total       power at X-band was 17.298+/-0.100 watts.  The X-band spur       was approximately 9.3 MHz above and at least 0.5 dB stronger than the       carrier.  For experiments conducted in May and June of 1994,       Transponder-A was used so that full power was available in each       carrier (no X-band spur).         Calibration Description - Spacecraft     ====================================       No information available.         Platform Mounting Descriptions - Spacecraft     ===========================================       The spacecraft +Z axis vector was in the nominal direction       of the HGA boresight.  The +X axis vector was parallel to       the nominal rotation axis of the solar panels.  The +Y axis       vector formed a right-handed coordinate system and was in       the nominal direction of the star scanner boresight.  The       spacecraft velocity vector was in approximately the -Y       direction when the spacecraft was oriented for left-looking       SAR operation.  The nominal HGA S-band polarization for radar       operation was linear in the y-direction; the nominal HGA S-band       polarization for telecommunications (and radio science) was       linear in the x-direction.  The nominal X-band polarization       was circular, with the sense depending on the transmitter       attached.         Cone Offset Angle              : 0.00       Cross Cone Offset Angle        : 0.00       Twist Offset Angle             : 0.00         The medium gain antenna boresight was 70 degrees from the +Z       direction and 20 degrees from the -Y direction.  The low       gain antenna was mounted on the back of the HGA feed; its       boresight was in the +Z direction and it had a hemispherical       radiation pattern.         Principal Investigators     =======================       The Principal Investigators for the gravity investigations       were William L. Sjogren, Michel Lefebvre, and Georges       Balmino.  The Principal Investigator for the radio       occultation experiments was G. Leonard Tyler.  The       Principal Investigator for the surface bistatic radar       experiments was Gordon H. Pettengill.  Investigators for the       solar scintillation and Faraday rotation observations were       Richard Woo and Michael Bird, respectively.         Instrument Section / Operating Mode Descriptions - Spacecraft     =============================================================       The Magellan radio system consisted of two sections, which       could be operated in the following modes:         Section      Mode       -------------------------------------------       Oscillator   two-way (coherent)                    one-way (non-coherent)       RF output    low-gain antenna (no information available)                    medium-gain antenna                    high-gain antenna         Selected parameters describing NST performance are listed       below:         Oscillator Parameters:                    S-Band     X-Band          Two-Way Transponder Turnaround Ratio  880/749    880/749          One-Way Transmit Frequency (MHz)     2297.963   8425.864          Frequency Uncertainty (+/- MHz)        0.0005      0.002          Nominal Wavelength (cm)                 12.97       3.54         RF Output parameters:                     S-Band     X-Band          RF Power Output (w)                       5.6       17.8          Medium-Gain Antenna:            Half-Power Half Beamwidth (deg)         9.2            Gain (dBi)                             19.

Each complex is equipped with       several antennas [including at least one each 70-m, 34-m High       Efficiency (HEF), and 34-m standard (STD)], associated       electronics, and operational systems.  Primary activity at each       complex is radiation of commands to and reception of telemetry       data from active spacecraft.  Transmission and reception is       possible in several radio-frequency bands, the most common       being S-band (nominally a frequency of 2100-2300 MHz or a       wavelength of 14.2-13.0 cm) and X-band (7100-8500 MHz or 4.2-       3.5 cm).  Transmitter output powers of up to 400 kw are       available.         Ground stations have the ability to transmit coded and uncoded       waveforms which can be echoed by distant spacecraft.  Analysis       of the received coding allows navigators to determine the       distance to the spacecraft; analysis of Doppler shift on the       carrier signal allows estimation of the line-of-sight       spacecraft velocity.  Range and Doppler measurements are used       to calculate the spacecraft trajectory and to infer gravity       fields of objects near the spacecraft.         Ground stations can record spacecraft signals that have       propagated through or been scattered from target media.       Measurements of signal parameters after wave interactions with       surfaces, atmospheres, rings, and plasmas are used to infer       physical and electrical properties of the target.         Principal investigators vary from experiment to experiment.       See the corresponding section of the spacecraft instrument       description or the data set description for specifics.         The Deep Space Network is managed by the Jet Propulsion       Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology for the       U.S.  National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

Subsystems - DSN     ================       The Deep Space Communications Complexes (DSCCs) are an integral       part of the Radio Science instrument, along with other       receiving stations and the spacecraft Radio Frequency       Subsystem.  Their system performance directly determines the       degree of success of Radio Science investigations, and their       system calibration determines the degree of accuracy in the       results of the experiments.  The following paragraphs describe       the functions performed by the individual subsystems of a DSCC.

The DMC is the center of activity at a DSCC.  The         DMC receives and archives most of the information from the         NOCC needed by the various DSCC subsystems during their         operation.  Control of most of the DSCC subsystems, as well         as the handling and displaying of any responses to control         directives and configuration and status information received         from each of the subsystems, is done through the DMC.  The         effect of this is to centralize the control, display, and         archiving functions necessary to operate a DSCC.         Communication among the various subsystems is done using a         Local Area Network (LAN) hooked up to each subsystem via a         network interface unit (NIU).           DMC operations are divided into two separate areas: the         Complex Monitor and Control (CMC) and the Link Monitor and         Control (LMC).  The primary purpose of the CMC processor for         Radio Science support is to receive and store all predict         sets transmitted from NOCC such as Radio Science, antenna         pointing, tracking, receiver, and uplink predict sets and         then, at a later time, to distribute them to the appropriate         subsystems via the LAN.  Those predict sets can be stored in         the CMC for a maximum of three days under normal conditions.         The CMC also receives, processes, and displays event/alarm         messages; maintains an operator log; and produces tape labels         for the DSP.  Assignment and configuration of the LMCs is         done through the CMC; to a limited degree the CMC can perform         some of the functions performed by the LMC.  There are two         CMCs (one on-line and one backup) and three LMCs at each DSCC         The backup CMC can function as an additional LMC if         necessary.           The LMC processor provides the operator interface for monitor         and control of a link -- a group of equipment required to         support a spacecraft pass.  For Radio Science, a link might         include the",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:mgs.accel,ACCELEROMETER for MGS,ACCELEROMETER,"     Instrument Overview   ===================     An accelerometer is an instrument that measures the acceleration     of the case of the sensor due to external forces. All     accelerometers have a 'proof mass' and it is the tendency of the     proof mass to move relative to the case that is a measure of the     acceleration of the case. Early accelerometers produced output     that was directly related to acceleration; but modern sensors     integrate the internally measured signal, to reduce noise, and the     output is proportional to the change in velocity over the     integration time. In high precision accelerometers, like those on     MGS, the proof mass is an electronically floating magnetic body.     The electromagnetic field is varied to keep the proof mass     stationary relative to the case. The voltage required to     accomplish this is proportional to the acceleration. The accel-     erometers on MGS are sensitive to acceleration of the center of     mass (c.m.) of the s/c, pseudo-accelerations (i.e., centrifugal)     due to rigid motion of the s/c about the c.m., and differences in     gravitational force at the proof mass and the c.m. of the s/c     (gravity gradient).       The MGS Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) contains four accel-     erometers. The principal accelerometer used in the aerobraking     analysis is the z-axis accelerometer. This accelerometer is     located at approximately (-0.44, -0.38, 0.72) m relative to the     center of mass. The accelerometers are Sundstrand QA1200-AA08     model Q-Flex and continuously integrate acceleration to obtain     velocity data. The instrument is sampled every 0.1 seconds. The     data are recorded in instrument counts or quantized velocity     increments equivalent to 0.332 mm/s per count. The QA1200 bias has     a specified temperature sensitivity of 10 mg/K or approximately     0.3 counts/K. The temperature of the IMU assembly is actively     controlled. IMU telemetered temperatures are quantized at 0.12 K     and typical changes during an entire aerobraking pass are between     two quantized values. Consequently, only a single, constant bias     is determined for each pass through the atmosphere.       Scientific Objectives   =====================     Accelerometer data were used to characterize the nature of the     atmosphere, to determine the effect of the atmosphere on each     orbit, and to predict the effect of the atmosphere on future     orbits.       Calibration   ===========     The instrument was calibrated on each orbit to determine drift in     instrument bias.  Bias is determined by monitoring the     accelerometer instrument during periods of inactivity before and     after entering the atmosphere. The bias acceleration is then     estimated over the entire pass by trending the data from the pre-     and post-atmospheric entry periods.  The pre- and post-atmospheric     periods were defined by instrument turn-on and turn-off times and     a lower limit on the altitude of data used for calibration,     typically 200 km.       Operational Considerations   ==========================     The instrument readings are affected by changes in temperature.     The instrument is mounted in the inertial measurement unit (IMU).     The temperature of the IMU box is monitored by two temperature     sensors, one inside the box and one on the box housing, and     controlled by a single heater. The quantum of temperature     measurement inside the IMU is 0.117 deg C and the highest     temperature variation was 2 quanta over a period of 4 seconds.     To calculate the effect of this temperature variation on     accelerometer measurements, the acclerometer manufacturer's     estimate of 0.3 counts of acceleration change per deg C of     temperature change was used. Therefore, a 2 quanta temperature     variation over 4 seconds resulted in an acceleration change of     5.8 * 10^-6 m/s^2. When compared to the acceleration values, the     value of acceleration due to temperature change was negligible for     altitudes within 30 km of periapsis. The temperature did not     exhibit any increase or decrease that would indicate atmospheric     heating was affecting the accelerometers inside the IMU. IMU     temperature data, as telemetered during the first 201 orbits,     yielded changes of less than 0.25 degrees C over an aerobraking     pass.     Operational Modes   =================     The data from the accelerometer are passed to the telemetry deck     during an aerobraking pass from the time the s/c reaches     aerobraking orientation until the s/c returns to nominal orbit     attitude.     Measured Parameters   ===================     An accelerometer is an instrument that measures the change in     velocity of the spacecraft over a time interval by measuring the     fluctuations of voltage to a magnetically floating assembly. The     assembly is essentially a simple magnetic mass floating in a     magnetically charged ring.  When the spacecraft accelerates, the     position of the mass inside the ring is maintained by varying the     voltage.  By recording the change in voltage to the ring and     knowing the physical properties of the mass, the acceleration of     the spacecraft can be calculated.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:mgs.er,ELECTRON REFLECTOMETER for MGS,ELECTRON REFLECTOMETER,"       Instrument Overview   ===================     The Electron Reflectometer system consists of a ''symmetric     quadrisphere'' imaging electrostatic analyzer, followed by a     microchannel plate (MCP) detector system with a resistive imaging     anode.  The analyzer has a narrow energy pass band (about 25%), which     can be set by the inner hemisphere potential.  This potential is     generated by a programmable high voltage supply, which is swept     through its range to measure electrons from 10eV to 20KeV.  Electrons     are imaged onto the MCP, which multiplies individual electrons by a     factor of about a million.  This cloud of electrons then hits a     resistive anode.  The relative signal level on each end of the anode     is measured by the Pulse Position Analyzer (PPA) to determine the     location on the anode that the electron cloud landed.  This location     translates into the direction in the field-of-view plane the incident     electron was coming from.  The output of the PPA is an 8 bit digital     value proportional to the incident direction, from 0 to 360 deg.       This information is run through a Pitch Angle Mapper (PAM) which     sorts the events into 16 pitch angle bins, which are then counted in     a bank of counters.  The PAM is programmed by the main electronics     package to convert the PPA output to pitch angle bins based on the     measured magnetic field vector provided by the magnetometer sensors.     The counters are read out to the main electronics package over a     serial interface 32 times a second, synchronized to the telemetry     clock (RTI).  The analyzer control voltages and PAM are programmed by     the main electronics package via another serial interface.       Platform Mounting Descriptions   ==============================     The ER is mounted on the instrument deck.  The ER's symmetry axis     (Z, which is orthogonal to its FOV) is orthogonal to the spacecraft     Z axis.  The projection of the symmetry axis onto the spacecraft XY     plane is 10 degrees from the -Y axis and 80 degrees from the +X     axis.       Principal Investigator   ======================     The Principal Investigator for the MAG/ER experiment is Mario     Acuna.  The Lead Investigator for the Electron Reflectometer is     Robert P. Lin.       For more information on the Electron Reflectometer see     [ACUNAETAL1992].       Scientific Objectives   =====================     See the MISSION_OBJECTIVES_SUMMARY item in the file MISSION.CAT.     (This file is in the CATALOG directory on this disk.)       Operational Considerations   ==========================     Parts of the spacecraft are within the instrument's FOV.  During pre-     mapping, the stowed high gain antenna (HGA) blocked ~70 degrees.     Once the HGA was deployed, only small amounts of blockage remained,     which are caused by attitude control thrusters and the -Y solar array     gimbal and yoke assembly.  One effect this has on the measurements is     to block ambient electrons from the directions of the obstacles. This     is most clearly seen at high energies (> 100 eV), which are only     slightly deflected by the spacecraft floating potential.  In     addition, when these obstacles are illuminated by the sun, they emit     photoelectrons up to ~50 eV, which can enter the ER aperture and     elevate the counting rate at low energies.  The detailed signature of     this effect depends on the illumination pattern as the spacecraft     rotates, which is a function of the angles between Earth, Mars, and     the Sun.  These angles vary over the course of the mission.     Photoelectron contamination has not been removed from the data;     however, the presence of contamination is readily identified in the     low energy channels (< 50 eV) by a sharp (nearly discontinuous)     increase in counting rate which appears once per spacecraft spin     (~100 minutes during pre-mapping, ~120 minutes during mapping).  The     contamination disappears as abruptly as it appears.       For a duration of ~4 minutes every half-spin of the spacecraft,     sunlight can directly enter the ER aperture and scatter inside the     instrument, creating secondary electrons. A tiny fraction of these     photons and secondary electrons can scatter down to the anode and     create a ''pulse'' of spurious counts.  This sunlight pulse appears     at all energies, but is most noticeable from 10 to 80 eV and above     1 keV.  Sunlight pulses have not been removed from the data.       The instrument's energy scale is referenced to spacecraft ground.     In sunlight, spacecraft ground floats a few volts positive relative     to the plasma in which the spacecraft is immersed.  Electrons are     accelerated by the spacecraft potential before they can enter the     ER aperture, thus all energies are shifted upward by a few eV.  In     addition to shifting the electron energy, the trajectories of low     energy electrons can be significantly bent by electric fields     around the spacecraft.  Thus, the energy scale and imaging     characteristics are relatively poor at the lowest energies (10-30     eV), becoming much more accurate at higher energies.       Calibration   ===========     The ER may be put into one of 5 automated calibration modes by     command. These modes (1, 2, 3, 4, and 6) are designed to measure     specific instrument performance characteristics.  Each mode     consists of a sequence of steps, each of which lasts one packet     collection interval. A calibration mode sequence can be programmed     to repeat from 1 to 255 times.  After the selected number of     iterations has been performed, the system is returned to its     original state, with a few minor exceptions. These exceptions     include:         1. The test pulser is turned off at the end of Cal mode 1,          independent of its original state.       2. The ER_PAM_FIX table and ER_PAM_OFFSET value are modified in          all Cal modes.       In all modes except mode 6, the telemetry format is identical to     the normal format, but the instrument is operated differently, as     described below, except that Case Current telemetry data is usually     garbled.  In mode 6, a block of each packet is used for the ADC     measurements, and the rest of the packet is scrapped.       In all Calibration modes, the PAM_FIXED mode is used (see below),     and the PAM_FIX table and PAM_OFFSET value are modified.  The     nominal values for the table are described below, but all can be     reprogrammed.         (1) ER Calibration Mode 1 (Test Pulser)         This mode is used to stimulate the instrument when the analyzer is     not functional (high voltages off).  It can also be used to     calibrate the PPA anode.  If the instrument high voltage is turned     on, real particle counts will be mixed with the test pulser counts.     The PAM is loaded with a fixed map which maps the region near the     pulser input with highest resolution (1 PPA bin per counter), with     the rest of the anode going into counter number 15 (the last pitch     angle bin).  Next the test pulser is turned on.  Its amplitude is     increased linearly from zero to full scale synchronous with the     normal one second analyzer voltage sweep, so that what is normally     energy step in the telemetry is now test pulser amplitude.  This is     repeated for one packet duration, and then the cycle is repeated     for the next packet with the next test pulser.  The whole sequence     lasts four ER packet intervals, as shown in the table below:             Packet Counter            Test Pulser    PAM_OFFSET             0                     A (30  deg)        13             1                     B (180 deg)       120             2                     C (330 deg)       227             3                     B (180 deg)       120         PAM_OFFSET is set to center the nominal test pulser location on the     high resolution part of the PAM.  The values of PAM_OFFSET and the     sequence of test pulsers are programmable.         (2) ER Calibration Mode 2 (MCP Bias)         This mode is used to determine the optimum setting of the MCP bias     voltage.  The instrument continues to operate in the normal mode,     except that the MCP bias voltage is modified once per packet, over     a cycle of 8 ER packets.  Also, the PAM_FIXED mode is used, with     the PAM table set to 16 equal 22.5 deg fixed image plane bins.     This allows a look at MCP efficiency as a function of location on     the MCP.  If there is one particular point on the MCP that should     be monitored, the PAM_FIX table generated for Cal mode 2 can be     modified in ER_CAL_PAM table - see discussion above.       Assuming conditions are stable over the test cycle time, the data     from the different MCP voltage settings can be compared on the     ground, and an optimum voltage can be selected and commanded up.     The pattern of MCP voltages used is programmable using the     ER_CAL2_MCPOFFSET command; the default values are +3, +6, 3, 0, -3,     -6, -3, 0.  The values from this table are added to the current MCP     DAC setting.  The last entry in this table should be 0; the MCP     will be left at the voltage level of the final entry.  Note that     the default table has steps of about 48 volts.         (3) ER Calibration Mode 3 (Background)         Calibration mode 3 is used to measure the instrument background     counting rate from noise and cosmic rays.  The instrument sweep is     stopped at about 10eV with the deflector attenuator set on.  The     PAM_FIX table and MCP bias are set and sequenced identically to Cal     mode 2, so that the background can be measured as a function of MCP     bias voltage. Unfortunately, unlike the case of Mars Observer, one     cannot completely shut off incoming electrons, so this mode is of     marginal usefulness.         (4) ER Calibration Mode 4 (Deflector Attenuator)         This mode is used to inter-calibrate the instrument sensitivity     with and without the deflector attenuator on.  This is done by     disabling normal sweeps, and fixing the analyzer voltage at the     place where the grid attenuator is normally turned on.  For the     first packet, the attenuator is off, and for the second packet it     is turned on (the cycle lasts 2 ER packet intervals).  The PAM_FIX     table is loaded for 16 equally spaced 22.5 deg bins.         (5) ER Calibration Mode 6 (Voltage Calibration)         This mode is used to measure the various analyzer voltages which     normally vary during a packet via the analog housekeeping ADC.  The     voltages are swept over their range slowly, and the ER analog     housekeeping ADC read-out time slot is dedicated to the measurement     (giving 4 samples per second).  The voltage sweeps are synchronized     to the ADC read-out times. The data from the ADC is loaded directly     into the ER telemetry packet right after the header, taking 48 16     bit words (48 12-bit ADC samples per packet, with the 4 MSB of each     word set to zero).  Normal telemetry data is lost, and the rest of     the packet will be garbled.  The mode consists of 2 different     cycles, each looking at different voltages, and each taking 1     packet interval to complete.         (5a) ER Calibration Mode 6, Cycle 1 (Analyzer and Deflector          Attenuator Voltages)         This cycle measures 32 samples of the analyzer voltage, using every     4th value of the normal analyzer sweep table.  Note that the gain     of the housekeeping channel switches when the gain of the     programming DAC for the analyzer is changed, and by the same     amount, so to correctly interpret the measurements, the setting of     the gain bit must be known for each measurement.  The MSB of each     sample contains the gain bit of the DAC for this purpose.  The     remaining 16 values are measurements of the attenuator grid made     while the analyzer and grid voltages are programmed in their normal     pattern over the second half of the sweep table, again using every     4th entry of the table.         (5b) ER Calibration Mode 6, Cycle 2 (Case Voltage)         The second packet of ER Cal mode 6 contain measurements of Vcase     (the case voltage), Icase (the case current), and Icase*80 (the     high gain Icase measurement), while the Case Voltage DAC is ramped     over its full range in 16 steps (starting at 0, 16 DAC steps each     sample). The data is ordered as 16 Vcase samples, followed by 16     Icase samples, and finally 16 Icase*80 samples.       Operational Modes   =================       (1) Energy sweep and attenuator         Data is accumulated over one or more energy sweeps.  Each energy     sweep takes 1 second, and is divided into 128 equal steps     (synchronized to the RTI).  The analyzer high voltage is swept from     high to low energy during the sweep in an approximately exponential     decay.  Data is collected for 16 pitch angle bins 30 times each     sweep, dividing phase space into 16 pitch angles by 30 energy bands     over the energy range of the instrument. Note that data is not     collected during the first 4 energy steps when the analyzer high     voltage is re-charged, or during the 4 steps that the attenuator     grid voltage is charged up.       The sweep voltage is controlled via the ER sweep registers to a 12     bit DAC with a gain switch.  The gain switch changes the sweep     voltage by a factor of 16 to increase the accuracy of the voltage     setting at the low end.  The software generates a log sweep pattern     on turn-on (which may be over-written by ground command), and     automatically sets the gain bit appropriately.       At a selectable point in the sweep, the deflection attenuator turns     on (default is at step 124, which means it never turns on).  This     decreases the sensitivity of the instrument by a factor of 43.5.     This is needed to avoid saturating the instrument at the low energy     end (where there are typically a lot of electrons), while allowing     maximum sensitivity at the high energy (where there are few     electrons).  When energized, the deflectors bend electrons from the     normal aperture out of the analyzer field of view, while     simultaneously bending electrons from the lower, attenuated     aperture into the analyzer field of view.  The deflection supply     runs at 8 times the analyzer high voltage,  but the supply tops out     at about 600 volts, and works only in the low gain range of the     analyzer high voltage.  The sweep voltage pauses while the grid     attenuator voltage comes on for one accumulation sector time, and     the data collected from that interval is discarded.         (2) PAM-variable Mode: (onboard pitch angle sorting)         The events are converted into 16 pitch angle bins, corresponding to     the 16 counters, using the PAM table.  This table is generated by     the software based on the direction of the magnetic field vector.     The PAM table is updated every 2, 4, or 8 seconds at 1296, 648, and     324bps respectively.  A one second average of the magnetic field     samples is computed for this purpose.  Offsets are then subtracted     from a programmable table.  Next, the vector is rotated into ER     sensor coordinates using a variable rotation array set by the solar     array motion model (see below), followed by a second fixed rotation     matrix.  The vector is then normalized and the azimuthal angle     (PHI) and cosine of the elevation angle (COSTH) are computed.  PHI     is the angle around the FOV plane, coded in an 8 bit number such     that 256=360 deg, zero degrees being at the anode break point,     increasing clockwise as viewed from the top of the analyzer (the     anode break point is 135 deg clockwise from the RPA aperture).     COSTH is the cosine of the elevation angle out of the FOV plane,     zero degrees being is the image plane.  COSTH is always positive,     since the sign is unimportant for PAM table computation.  These     quantities are the basis of the PAM table generation, and are     transmitted in the ER packet so that the PAM table can be     reconstructed on the ground for computing the bin weighting.       The PAM table is generated by computing the image plane location of     the pitch angle bin boundaries, and then filling in the rest of the     table, using the relationship:           Bin = PHI +- Cos-1(COSPAi/COSTH)           where:        Bin is the image plane bin corresponding to pitch angle boundary # i        COSPAi is the cosine of the i-th pitch angle boundary        +- is the 'plus-or-minus' sign, normally represented by a + sign             above a - sign, but written here as +- for typographical             reasons.         The COSPAi are programmable.         (3) PAM-fixed Mode.         This computation can be bypassed by going to a 'Fixed' PAM table,     which is independent of the magnetic field direction.  This can be     done by command or automatically during calibration cycles.  The     'fixed' map is characterized by a set of 16 image plane boundaries     and a rotation of that pattern similar in function to PHI.       Before the PAM table is loaded into the ER, the table is masked to     remove a programmable set of 'bad' regions.  These are parts of the     image plane which are noisy or which have objects in the FOV     distorting the trajectories.  This table defaults to 'none'.       Measured Parameters   ===================     The ER measures particle counts from 1 to 507904.  The instrument     integrates for 0.0625 seconds at each energy channel every 2     seconds. The noise level is about 10 counts per second at all     energies.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:mgs.mag,MAGNETOMETER for MGS,MAGNETOMETER,"     Abstract   ========     The Mars Global Surveyor magnetic field instrument consists of     dual, triaxial fluxgate magnetometers, capable of measuring fields     between +/- 4 nT and +/- 65536 nT. Automated range switching allows     the instrument to maintain maximum digital resolution over a wide     range of field strengths.       The text of this instrument description has been abstracted from     the instrument paper [ACUNAETAL1992]:         Acuna, M. A., J. E. P. Connerney, P. Wasilewski, R. P. Lin,       K. A. Anderson, C. W. Carlson, J. McFadden, D. W. Curtis, H.       Reme, A. Cros, J. L. Medale, J. A. Sauvaud, C. d'Uston, S. J.       Bauer, P. Cloutier, M. Mayhew, and N. F. Ness, Mars Observer       Magnetic Fields Investigation, J. Geophys. Res., 97, 7799-7814,       1992.       The description and ASCII drawings of the instrument mounting and     frames are derived from the SPICE instrument kernel version 1.2     dated Sept. 16, 1998. Please review the published material for a     complete description of the instrument.       Scientific Objectives   =====================     The primary objective of the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) magnetic     field experiment is to establish the nature of the magnetic field     of Mars. This includes determining whether or not Mars has a global     field of internal origin indicating either present or past dynamo     field generation. The existence of an internally generated field     would place significant constraints on the composition, thermal     state, and dynamics of the interior of the planet.       Even if dynamo activity ceased as the planet cooled, there is     evidence that dynamo activity existed in the past. Remanent     magnetization has been observed in meteorites that are widely     believed to have originated on Mars [BOGARD&JOHNSON1983]. An     important objective of the magnetic field investigation is to     identify and characterize crustal remanent magnetization. Magnetic     anomaly maps, together with geological data will provide a history     of Martian magnetism and crustal evolution.       Previous missions to Mars have determined that if there is a global     magnetic field at Mars it must be small [LUHMANN1991]. Remanent     magnetic fields are also likely to be small [ACUNAETAL1992]. In     order to accurately measure magnetic fields of Martian origin, the     nature of the solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field     interactions with Mars must be well determined.       Calibration   ===========     The flight software incorporated into the on-board data processor     includes diagnostic and self-calibration routines [ACUNAETAL1992].     On-board calibration sequences provide the currents required for     determination of the gain of each axis sensor for the various     dynamic ranges, as well as for determination of electronic offsets     by reversal of the polarity of the signals processed by the     magnetometer electronics. In addition, spacecraft maneuvers will be     performed that will allow the spacecraft field and sensor offsets     to be determined independently.       Operational Considerations   ==========================     The magnetometer power consumption is 375 mW in zero field and     increases with the magnitude of the measured field up to 420 mW.     The typical rms noise level in the sensors is 0.006 nT over a 10 Hz     bandwidth. The zero-level stability is less than 0.15 nT over the     range of -40 to +60 degrees Centigrade and for durations up to a     year. The upper range of 65,536 nT allows the instrument to be     operated in the Earth's magnetic field without special shields or     field cancellation magnets.       Detectors   =========     The MGS magnetometer experiment consists of two, fully redundant,     fluxgate magnetometers. There are two sensor triads, two sets     of electronics, and two power converter packages. Either sensor     triad can be connected to either electronics package. Only one of     the two systems is powered at any time. The other system is powered     off and maintained in a standby state for redundancy.       The detectors are constructed using the ring core geometry, which     has been shown to have excellent performance characteristics in     terms of long-term zero-level stability and drive power     requirements. The magnetic material used to manufacture the sensors     in an advanced molybdenum-permalloy alloy developed for low-noise,     high-stability applications.       The MGS spacecraft does not have a magnetometer boom to mount the     sensors on as the original Mars Observer spacecraft did. Instead,     the two sensor packages are mounted on the solar panel arrays.

This frame is defined in an MGS SCLK file       created by mgs_scet2sclk program at LMA. Orientation of this       frame is provided in the CK files produced by the ATTREC program       at LMA.         'MGS_LEFT_SOLAR_ARRAY' and 'MGS_RIGHT_SOLAR_ARRAY' frames are       associated with the +Y and -Y solar array gimbals respectively.       These frames are defined in an MGS SCLK file created by the       mgs_scet2sclk program at LMA. Orientation of these frames is       provided in the CK files produced by the MGSSCK program at LMA.       Note that there are no separate frames defined for inboard       ('elevation') and outboard ('azimuth') gimbals for each solar       array. Instead each pair of gimbals is considered as a single       gimbal having two degrees of rotation. These frame can be       considered as 'nominal' solar array position frames since they       specify gimbal orientation and do not take into account any       additional rotations/transformation that can (did) occur due to       incomplete deployment of an array.         'MGS_+Y_SOLAR_ARRAY' and 'MGS_-Y_SOLAR_ARRAY' frames are       associated with the +Y and -Y solar array yokes respectively.       These frames are 'fixed offset' frames whose orientation is       specified by a set of Euler angles relative to the corresponding       frames associated with gimbals. Defining these frames was       required because of -Y Solar array deployment failure, which       introduced an additional rotation in the yoke for that panel.       For the +Y panel this frame is the same as the gimbal frame.         'MGS_MAG_+Y_SENSOR' and 'MGS_MAG_-Y_SENSOR' frames are associated       with +Y and -Y MAG sensors. These frames are fixed offset frames       whose orientation is specified by a set of Euler angles relative       to the corresponding yoke frames.       Electronics   ===========     Signals from the sensors are first processed by the analog     electronics and then by the digital processing unit (DPU). Analog     data are anti-alias filtered and then sent to a twelve bit     (12-bit) successive approximation analog to digital (A/D) converter     that is controlled by a microprocessor. Variable time resolution     data are derived from the basic measurements and the spacecraft     telemetry mode. The microprocessor activates the automatic gain     control logic in the electronics. If the magnitude of the measured     vector component falls within upper or lower guard bands (256 data     numbers), then the range (scale factor) is incremented or     decremented to maintain maximum digital resolution. Range     adjustments change the dynamic range and digital quantization by a     factor of four.

The system consists of a master     executive program that is resident in ROM. The DPU uses the 80C86     microprocessor and associated memory and peripheral devices. Default     parameter tables used for data processing are stored in ROM but can     be modified by ground command. Parameters such as sensor zero     levels, alignment matrices, scale factors, etc. are expected to be     updated periodically under normal operating conditions. RAM memory     is used to double buffer data while packets are being created and     accessed by the PDS. Double buffering allows a completed packet to     be read out while a new packet is being created without access     conflicts between the instrument and the PDS. Data collection and     processing routines are interrupt driven by a real time interrupt     (RTI) signal provided eight times per second by the onboard PDS.     The clock is multiplied four times (32 Hz) and is the fundamental     timing signal for all processes in the instrument.       Data compression techniques are used to maximize data return within     the bandwidth allocated to the experiment. Raw magnetometer data are     averaged and then 6-bit differenced between adjacent averages. The     differences are combined with periodic 12-bit 'full-words' and     formatted into data packets. If the differences exceed the dynamic     range of six bits, the system folds the values (modulo 64) over     rather than saturating. This allows the reconstruction of rapidly     varying fields that would otherwise be lost. If the number of     folded differences exceeds a predetermined value, the DPU left     shifts the differencing scheme by the least significant bit doubling     the dynamic range. There is a maximum of two left shifts permitted.     The data return sample rate is linked to the spacecraft data rate.     The instrument has three data rate allocations. Both the rate of     primary (compressed) samples and secondary (full-word) samples     varies with the data rate.          Data Rate          Primary Values         Secondary Values        (bits/sec)         (samples/sec)            (samples/sec)        -----------------------------------------------------------          324                   8                       1/6          648                  16                       1/3         1296                  32                       2/3in       ===================================================================          ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:mgs.moc,MARS ORBITER CAMERA for MGS,MARS ORBITER CAMERA,"     (Note: the majority of this text was derived from that in   [MALINETAL1991])     Instrument Overview   ===================     The Mars Observer Camera (MOC) was initially developed as part of     the Mars Observer instrument complement.  After the loss of MO,     the MOC flight spare was completed and flown on the Mars Global     Surveyor spacecraft.  To avoid a confusing change of acronym, the     instrument on MGS is called the Mars Orbiter Camera, but is often     referred to internally to the MOC project as MOC2.  Regardless,     the two instruments are essentially identical.       MOC is a three-component imaging system (one narrow-angle and two     wide-angle cameras) designed to take high spatial resolution     pictures of the surface and to obtain lower spatial resolution,     synoptic coverage of the surface and atmosphere [MALINETAL1992,     MALINETAL1998].  The cameras are based on the 'push broom'     technique, acquiring one line of data at a time as the spacecraft     orbits the planet.  Using the narrow-angle camera during the     Mapping Phase of the mission, areas ranging from 2.8 x 2.8 km to     2.8 x 25.2 km (depending on available internal digital buffer     memory) can be imaged at about 1.4 m/pixel.  Additionally,     lower-resolution pictures (to a lowest resolution of about 11     m/pixel) can be acquired by pixel averaging; these images can be     much longer, ranging up to 2.8 x 500 km at 11 m/pixel.       The following table summarizes MOC characteristics.

The MOC wide-angle     cameras are capable of viewing Mars from horizon to horizon and     are designed for low-resolution global and intermediate     resolution regional studies.  Low-resolution observations can be     made every orbit during the Mapping Phase, so that in a single     24-hour period a complete global picture of the planet can be     assembled at a resolution of at least 7.5 km/pixel.  Regional     areas (covering hundreds of km on a side) may be imaged at a     resolution of better than 250 m/pixel at the nadir.  These images     will be particularly useful in studying time-variable features     such as lee clouds, the polar cap edge, and wind streaks, as well     as acquiring stereoscopic coverage of areas of geological     interest.  The limb can be imaged at vertical and along-track     resolutions of better than 1.5 km.  Color filters within the two     wide-angle cameras permit color images of the surface and     atmosphere to be made to distinguish between clouds and the     ground and between clouds of different composition.       Calibration   ===========     MOC is fixed to the nadir panel of the spacecraft, and therefore     cannot view any spacecraft-mounted calibration targets.  Through     a combination of pre-launch calibration over temperature ranges     anticipated at Mars, and occasional coordinated observations with     TES, especially during regional or global dust storms when the     atmosphere obscures the surface and presents a relatively     featureless target, it is anticipated that MOC data can be     calibrated photometrically to about <=10% in an absolute sense,     although the relative photometric precision of the data (pixel to     pixel) should be better than 3%.       Operational Considerations   ==========================     The pre-mapping MOC observations were taken while MGS was in its     elliptical capture and aerobraking orbits.  Imaging was only done     for a few minutes immediately after periapsis, when the     spacecraft was either tracking the nadir or performing the     so-called 'rollout', a reorientation maneuver that returned it     from the aerobraking drag pass to an Earth-pointed attitude.  (A     handful of images were taken when the spacecraft was explicitly     slewed to point at targets of interest, including the Viking and     Pathfinder landing sites, Phobos, and the 'Face on Mars'.)     Altitudes were at times lower than those expected in mapping, but     the high velocity of the spacecraft usually precluded clocking     the line array fast enough to produce images with a 1:1 pixel     aspect ratio.  In this period, a wide variety of summing modes     and line times were used to address imaging goals in the best way     possible.  Global coverage with the wide angle cameras was not     possible in this period; typically a small fraction of the MOC     buffer was devoted to reduced-resolution WA images for regional     monitoring, while the lion's share of the buffer was used to     store targeted NA images.       The remainder of this discussion describes observations planned     from the mapping orbit.  Low resolution observations can be made     every orbit, so that in a single 24-hour period a complete global     picture of the planet can be assembled at a resolution of at     least 7.5 km/pixel.  Of course, because the Mars Global Surveyor     orbit is sun synchronous, this global picture shows how each part     of Mars appears at approximately 2:00 PM local time.  From an     imaging perspective, this global map also illustrates two     principal limitations in the Mars Global Surveyor orbit: the     absence of diurnal coverage (it samples Mars only at two times of     day, one of which is unsuitable for visible imaging) and the poor     illumination angle (chosen prior to the selection of a camera for     the mission).  Relief will be less apparent in images taken at     low incidence angles near the equator, but at higher latitudes     (i.e., nearer the terminator), relief shading will become more     prominent.  Shadows will be visible near the poles.       The fields of view of both the NA and WA cameras, the nature of     the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft and mission, and specific     aspects of the MOC design place certain constraints on viewing     Mars.  The width of MOC NA frames is limited by the camera FOV to     be about 2.9 km.  Even if MGS orbits were uniformly spaced, it     would take over 600 days for the same location near the equator     to be viewed twice.  Given the 687 nominal mission duration and     the vagaries of the Mars Global Surveyor orbit that result from     gravitational perturbations and atmospheric drag, MOC will be     fortunate to pass over each equatorial area once.  At higher     latitudes, of course, the number of opportunities to image a     given location increases.  Unfortunately, the along- and     cross-track orbit prediction uncertainties are larger than the NA     FOV owing to mission operational constraints on Earth.  Thus,     targeting a given feature will be a probabilistic activity.     Contiguous 'mosaics' of NA images are not possible.  The WA FOV     covers approximately 1300 km on the surface from nadir to each     limb.  At the equator, MGS orbits are spaced about 1500 km, so     the limb on one orbit is at the nadir on the subsequent orbit,     and again at the limb on the orbit after that.  There is     therefore good overlap at the equator, and excellent overlap     closer to the poles.  Contiguous WA mosaics are possible.       MOC image sizes are determined by the camera FOV (cross-track     dimension, as noted above) and by the size and utilization of the     12 MB digital buffer (along-track).  Using realtime compression,     it is possible to acquire an image longer than the orbit     determination along-track uncertainty.  However, other contents     of the buffer may prevent its use in this manner.  Buffer space     is thus an important resource that requires close management.     For this reason, MOC images can vary in size and compression     factor.  For the NA, areas ranging from 2.9 km X 2.9 km to 2.9 km     X 25.2 km (depending on available buffer memory) can be imaged at     about 1.4 m/pixel.  Additionally, lower resolution pictures (to a     lowest resolution of about 11 m/pixel) can be acquired by pixel     averaging.  Contingent as well upon available power, these images     can be much longer, ranging up to 2.9 X 500 km at 11 m/pixel.       Since payload selection and the Mars Observer project 'new start'     in 1986, the data return from the MOC has grown significantly     with better understanding of the spacecraft and ground     telecommunication system.  Mission data rates, and the MOC data     rate allocation, vary substantially over the course of the MGS     mission, owing to Deep Space Network link performance.  They     include recording at 3.5, 7, and 14 Kbps, and transmitting in     realtime at 34.2 Kbps.  MOC data rates vary from 0.7 Kbps during     the lowest record rate to 9 Kbps during the highest record rate,     and 29 Kbps during realtime transmissions.  These rates permit     the daily transmission of roughly 2, 4, and 8 uncompressed 2048 X     2048 images during 'record only' days and, once every three days,     14 such images during an eight hour realtime pass.  These numbers     can be larger or smaller, depending on the compression factors     used and the resolution of the global map that is being acquired     at the same time.  MOC is capable of simultaneously sending data     to both the record and realtime streams, and is further capable     of matching any data rate available on-board the spacecraft.       Detectors   =========     To minimize mass and complexity, and to increase reliability, all     three MOC camera heads are line-scan imagers.  This allows the     detectors to be electronically shuttered, eliminating the need     for a mechanical shutter.  The substantial advantages of     line-scan systems comes at the cost of fixed exposure times.     This is not a problem for the WA (f/6, 13 lines per second), but     is a substantial problem for the NA (f/10, 2200 lines per     second).  In order to meet the signal to noise requirement of     20:1 over an appreciable part of the planet, the overall signal     chain noise performance must be better than 100 electrons.  This     performance must be met at the raw acquisition pixel processing     rate of 5 million pixels per second.       In order to meet the noise and other performance requirements,     two custom CCDs were fabricated for the MOC by Ford Aeronutronics     (now Loral Aeronutronics): one for the MOC NA (2048 13 um pixels,     two outputs) and one for the MOC WA (3456 7 um pixels, one     output).  Development work also resulted in devices with thinner     polysilicon layers than used in Ford's standard process,     increasing their quantum efficiency in the blue (400 to 450 nm).       The custom CCDs are individually packaged and mounted on custom     hybrid ceramic substrates.  Each hybrid is attached to a small     printed circuit board (PCB) that contains a small amount of     pre-amplification circuitry inside the radiation shielding to     minimize low level signal path lengths.  The hybrid and PCB are     mounted together in a focal plane assembly that provides     mechanical alignment of the detector to the optics, radiation     shielding of the detector (down to <1 kilorad for the NA, <2     kilorad for the WA), and thermal control.  Each FPA has a heater     to keep it warm during the cold cruise to Mars, and each     incorporates a thermal path to conduct away heat produced during     operation.  In the case of the NA, the thermal path runs from the     FPA to an 'internal radiator' behind the primary mirror.  This     radiator loses its heat by radiation to the back of the primary     mirror which, in turn, loses heat by radiation to Mars during the     nominal mission, or to space during interplanetary cruise.  The     focal plane assemblies are attached to the main analog circuitry     through flex cables with multiple isolated return paths to     minimize cross-talk.       Based on breadboard measurements, the NA signal chain has a     readout noise is less than 70 electrons, and a dark current noise     of less than 3 electrons rms at its operating rate.  The WA     signal chain has a readout noise of less than 15 electrons, and a     dark current noise of less than 25 electrons at WA operating     rates.  In-band quantum efficiency for the NA detector (i.e.,     between 500-900 nm) is better than 35%, for the WA red detectors     (575-625 nm) better than 35%, and for the WA blue detectors     (400-450 nm) better than 10%.  Both detector designs have charge     transfer efficiencies better than 0.999995.       Combined with the optics described previously, the 2048 X     1-element line array with 13 um pixels provides permits a NA     resolution of 1.41 m/pixel from 380 km altitude and better than     1.5 m/pixel over the entire range of operational altitudes, while     the WA cameras, using the 3456 X 1-element line array with 7 um     pixels, achieve nadir resolutions of 233 m/pixel (blue) and 242     m/pixel (red) from 380 km altitude.       Electronics   ===========       Analog Electronics     ------------------       Separate but similar processing chains are used for the NA and       WA cameras.  Both chains provide control of gain to 3 db ('root       2') resolution.  Offset control in 256 steps covering the range       from 0 to 5 times the full scale of the analog-to-digital       converter (A/D) is provided to subtract the effects of, for       example, atmospheric scattering prior to A/D conversion.  All       camera outputs are digitized to eight bit resolution.         Correlated double sampling (CDS) is implemented in both cameras       to attenuate reset and low-frequency noise.  In the WA this is       performed by the fairly conventional means of using two       separate sample and hold circuits, one holding the reset level       and the other the video level, both driving the inputs of a       difference amplifier.  Owing to the high speed of the NA (each       of the two NA CCD outputs produces pixels at 400 ns intervals),       a 200 ns delay line comb filter is used in each output chain to       form the difference between the reset and video period, and       this difference is further filtered and sampled before the       offset and A/D operation.         All variable gain is taken before the CDS, while the signal is       effectively 'chopped,' providing immunity from offset drift in       these amplifiers.  Monolithic transimpedance amplifiers are       extensively used in the NA for their compactness and       high-frequency performance.  A slow feedback loop maintains the       average reset level of the signal at a fixed voltage, keeping       the reset and video levels in a stable, linear range of the       amplifiers while the clock feedthrough transients are removed       by clipping stages to keep the amplifiers out of saturation.         For each of the NA and WA, dual-tracking linear field effect       transistor-series regulators, operating with about 300 mV of       headroom, provide overall post-regulation and ripple rejection       for the analog 10 V power rails.  L-C-R decoupling is used to       isolate individual amplifiers.  These regulators provide       overcurrent power cycling and current monitoring to the       housekeeping telemetry.  They operate as switches to shut down       the analog load by microprocessor command, to conserve power.         Both NA and WA analog systems show long-term gain stability of       better than 1% and gain stability over temperature excursions       of better than 0.5% per 10 degrees C.  The NA system uses about       700 parts and draws about 3 W; each of the WA systems uses       about 450 parts and draws 1 W.  Noise through the WA analog       system is 25 electrons, while noise through the NA analog       system is less than 80 electrons.         'Slow Digital' Electronics     --------------------------       The MOC digital system is divided into two parts: that       constrained to operate at the clock speed of the microprocessor       (the 'fast' digital electronics) and that which is not so       constrained (the 'slow digital' electronics).  In order to       isolate potential noise interactions between the 'slow' and       'fast' electronics, and to minimize the amount of circuitry       that had to be placed on one face of a 35 cm diameter PCB, they       have been placed on separate faces of two-sided PCB assemblies.         The MOC 'slow digital' electronics include the power supply,       bus interface unit (BIU), housekeeping/engineering measurement       circuitry, and power switching elements (PSE).  The power       supply consists of two flyback-type switching converters, each       capable of operating asynchronously at approximately 45 KHz but       normally synchronized to a common 50 KHz clock.  Both       converters share a common input filter.  One converter (the       'digital' converter) operates whenever the spacecraft-provided       28 VDC bias is present.  It provides +5 V to the digital logic       and +20, +10 and -10.5 V to various sensitive analog loads (for       which separate return lines are maintained).  The second       converter (the 'analog' converter) also draws from the       spacecraft 28 VDC power, but may be turned off using secondary       control logic.  It supplies only analog referenced voltages:       +22.5, +10.5, -10.5, +12, -5, and -20 V.         Voltages from each of two 'slow digital' boards are 'diode       or'd' to provide power redundancy to the analog and digital       systems.         The bus interface unit is Mars Global Surveyor Project-provided       hardware that acts as the link between the MOC and the       spacecraft Payload Data Sub-System (PDS).  Three functions are       accomplished by the BIU: 1) it receives MOC uplink commands       from the PDS (in the form of a serial bit-stream that is       converted by the BIU to a 16-bit parallel format at the BIU/MOC       interface), 2) it requests and receives from the MOC science       and engineering data in 16-bit words on specific polling       schedules, and 3) it provides a spacecraft timing reference       signal (the Real-Time Interrupt, RTI) eight times a second.       The PDS to BIU link is Manchester II encoded, and the BIU       incorporates a custom encoder/decoder chip to decode commands.       All three signals are carried over shielded differential       twisted wire pairs.         MOC housekeeping/engineering monitoring occurs for 48 points       within each redundant system--34 voltages and currents and 14       temperatures.  Test points are selected using analog switches;       the voltage from a selected test point is fed to a voltage       controlled oscillator (VCO) which is allowed to settle for two       output cycles.  VCO cycles are counted by an A/D converter,       with sampling initiated on an integer RTI and completed one RTI       later.  The final count may be read immediately thereafter.       Housekeeping telemetry is sampled four times each second.         Owing to power constraints, the MOC implements power management       circuity.  Power switching elements permit various sections of       the MOC digital and analog electronics to be power-cycled to       reduce orbit-average power consumption.  Some of these elements       also incorporate circuitry to sense overcurrents that result       from cosmic-ray induced single-event latchups (SEL).       Power-cycling these sections enables the MOC electronics to       avoid the deleterious effects of such latch-ups.         'Fast Digital' Electronics     --------------------------       The MOC digital electronics incorporate many advanced       technologies.  Three aspects of the all-CMOS digital       electronics are highlighted here: the microprocessor, the three       custom ASIC designs (on two chips), and the DRAM buffer memory.       Figure 5 shows the layout of the 'fast digital' board,       illustrating the relationships between the main elements of the       digital design.         The MOC control system is based on a radiation-hard version of       the National Semiconductor 32C016 microprocessor developed by       Sandia National Laboratories (the Sandia SA3300).  The SA3300       is a 32-bit microprocessor with a 16-bit bus and a 24-bit       address space.  The MOC operates its SA3300 at 10 MHz, giving a       computational performance of just under 1 MIPS.  Among the       advantages of this processor is that all flight software could       be written in a high level programming language ('C').  All       memory and control registers are located in the logical address       space of the microprocessor.  All of its address space is also       directly accessible by ground command through the PDS by direct       memory load.         All of the MOC digital design except the microprocessor,       memory, and BIU is implemented in gate arrays.  Three basic       designs are used, with two occurring on the same chip.  The       three designs are called the Control Gate Array (CGA), the       Buffer Gate Array (BGA), and the Narrow Angle Gate Array       (NAGA).  Four parts (1 CGA, 2 BGA, and 1 NAGA) are used in each       of the redundant half-systems.         The CGA provides the link between the SA3300 microprocessor and       the rest of the system by performing all address decoding and       memory mapping.  It incorporates interfaces to the program       memory and operational memory, three direct memory access (DMA)       channels to the BIU, and the housekeeping/engineering VCO.  It       also includes the reset/bootstrap controller and 'deadman'       timer.  The CGA permits direct memory/register access without       CPU intervention, allowing the MOC to continue to function       should its microprocessors fail during the mission, albeit in a       degraded fashion.         The BGAs provide DRAM interfaces to each of two separate       'banks' consisting of 6 MByte each.  Each BGA also provides WA       CCD clocking, analog setting control, and downtrack summing for       one of the two WA cameras, as well as WA data DMA.  Each BGA       allows data DMA for both the Mars Balloon Relay (MBR) link and       the NA camera, and applies ECC to the MBR data.         The NAGA provides acquisition control and image processing       capabilities for the NA camera.  It generates the NA clocking       and acquisition control signals.  Image processing capabilities       include cross-track summing, and one- and two-dimensional       predictive compression, resampling, and Huffman encoding.  All       data acquired through the NAGA may be optionally impressed with       a 16-bit polynomial ECC syndrome capable of correcting 2 bit       errors in 256.         Each of the MOC's two half-systems incorporates more digital       memory than has cumulatively flown on planetary missions:       ninety- six 1 Mbit DRAMs arranged in two banks of 3 million       16-bit words each.  The primary use of this memory is image       storage and downlink data rate buffering, although       approximately 1 MByte is allocated for flight software use       (e.g., command sequences, scratch space, etc.).  Access       bandwidth to the RAM buffer is sufficient to accommodate NA,       WA, and MBR acquisitions, and memory refresh and PDS DMA       transfers, all simultaneously and at their maximum rates.  CPU       accesses are given lower priority and are delayed as necessary       to allow other system activities the access they require.         The DRAM devices are susceptible to both cosmic-ray induced       single event upset and latchup (SEU and SEL).  Based on tests       performed by the MOC design team, SEUs will probably occur less       than 100 times each day under normal solar conditions.  The ECC       applied to information stored in the DRAM was designed to       repair such data corruption; the software refresh rate is       selectable to match the actual upset rate.  Such procedures       will not work during energetic solar flares, but these are       expected to occur rarely during the Mars Observer mission.       Additionally, every set of three devices (i.e., one bit in the       16-bit word) has a separate power sensing element capable of       detecting SEL-induced overcurrent, and power-cycling those       parts.  As these devices use capacitive storage, the short-       duration power-cycles are non-destructive (i.e., the memories       retain their contents).         The MOC includes two other memory banks--one each for program       memory and operational memory.  The program memory consists of       128 KBytes of ultraviolet-erasable programmable read-only       memory (UVEPROM), while the operational memory consists of 192       KBytes of radiation-hard static random access memory (SRAM).       The flight software is stored in the UVEPROM, with ECC.  It is       copied into the SRAM for execution.  A small amount of SRAM is       also used as a high- speed line buffer for the NAGA.         Flight Software     ---------------       The MOC flight software is very sophisticated.  It is capable       of establishing the acquisition parameters of many different       data types, while simultaneously conducting routine       housekeeping and data compression tasks.  Among its       housekeeping tasks is the continual refreshing of the DRAM       buffer ECC.         WA commanding constitutes the most complicated task of the       flight software.  Owing to the desire to simultaneously acquire       global monitoring, NA context, and local and regional WA       coverage, a schema of 'virtual cameras' was implemented.  The       BGA incorporates a 16-line 'ring buffer' into which WA       observations are continuously acquired on each sun-lit pass;       the flight software routes lines from this buffer to separate       addresses, each representing a different acquisition or       'camera.' Downtrack and cross-track summing can be performed       separately from full- resolution acquisitions.  Different pixel       positions along the detectors may also be selected so that, for       example, both nadir 'context' frames and limb observations can       be acquired at the same time without returning to Earth the       full 3456 pixel FOV.         Data Compression     ----------------       MOC has considerable capabilities to compress images to       optimize use of its buffer and downlink bandwidth allocation.       Three different forms of compression are available.  During       acquisition of images (i.e., in realtime), a predictive       compression technique can be employed, in either lossless or       'lossy' form, to acquire more data than would otherwise fit in       the MOC buffer.  As noted above, predictive compression is       implemented in hardware for the NA camera; the same algorithm       can be applied in software to WA data.  Depending on scene       content, lossless compression factors from 1.5 to 2.5 are       possible; with loss, the factors are larger but image quality       degrades rapidly, primarily by contouring that results from       insufficient bits to represent the actual image gray levels.       Once otherwise uncompressed data are in the buffer, they can be       compressed using two transform compression techniques: Walsh-       Hadamard (WH) and Discrete Cosine (DC).  WH transform       compression, which uses square-wave approximations of spatial       frequency content, can be used to compress images by factors of       3 to 5 with acceptable degradation, that appears mostly in the       form of 'blockiness' associated with the loss of high frequency       information.  DC transform compression, using cosine       representation of spatial frequencies, provides the highest       compression factors with the least degradation, but takes about       30 minutes to compress a typical image (2048 X 2048).       Compression factors of 10:1 show little visual evidence of       degradation, although they may have increased radiometric noise       (in the 1-3 DN range) within each 16 X 16 pixel transform       block.  Visual degradation of DC transformed images typically       focuses on the boundaries between the transform blocks, which       become more obvious when these blocks contain different       information owing to requantization of the higher frequency       components.       Optics and Filters   ==================     The NA camera is a 3.5 m focal length (f/10) Ritchey-Chretien     telescope, filtered to operate in the 500-900 nm bandpass.  The     WA system consists of two cameras with the same FOV, one     optimized in the 400-450 nm ('blue') bandpass and the other in     the 575-625 nm ('red') bandpass.  The blue WA camera (f/6.3) has     an on-axis focal length of 11.4 mm, while the red WA camera     (f/6.4) has an on- axis focal length of 11.0 mm.       The MOC structure is approximately 88 cm in length and 40 cm in     diameter, including four major components.  The largest component     of the camera is the NA tube (called the Secondary Mirror Support     Assembly or SMSA), which holds the secondary mirror spider and     acts as both an optical baffle and the primary/secondary distance     metering bench.  The SMSA is fabricated of pseudo-isotropic     P75S/ERL1962 graphite/epoxy in a (0, 45, 90, 135) layup.     P75S/ERL1962 graphite/epoxy was selected as the main structural     material within the MOC primarily for its high strength and     stiffness per unit mass and low density (leading to a low mass)     and low coefficient of thermal expansion over a large temperature     range (allowing it to maintain focus without active mechanisms or     complicated matched-material thermal metering).  Attached to the     side of the SMSA is the WA assembly, consisting of a mechanical     support tube (the Wide Angle Support Assembly, or WASA) also made     of P75S/ERL1962 graphite/epoxy with Invar fittings, the two WA     optics and focal planes, and a WA baffle.  Beneath the SMSA is     the P75S/ERL1962 graphite/epoxy Main Body Structural Assembly     (MBSA), which supports the primary mirror, NA focal plane and     associated electronics, and connects these to the SMSA.  Below     the MBSA is the electronics assembly, housing three 2-sided     electronics boards within an aluminum chassis/radiator assembly,     connected to the MBSA by a T300/934 graphite/epoxy conical     'flexure skirt.'       Owing to the high magnification on the secondary mirror (7.75X)     required to fold a 3.5 m focal length into 45 cm (17.8 inches),     the NA optics are extremely sensitive to focus: a 1 um shift     between the primary and secondary mirrors results in a 60 um     movement of the plane of best focus, and the relatively fast     optics provides only a 115 um depth of field.  Thus, the NA     design is extremely sensitive to gravitational, vibrational, and     thermal loads, and to moisture absorption, which arises from the     hygroscopic nature of the epoxy.  Great care has been taken to     minimize the effects of temperature variations on the camera.     For example, the secondary spider vanes are arranged such that     expansion or contraction of their lengths will rotate rather than     despace, decenter or tilt the secondary mirror.  Adoption of a     passive, graphite/epoxy-based structural metering system, and the     uncertainties in its performance prior to actual testing of the     Flight system, led to the inclusion of a bakeout heater to     dehydrate the structure during cruise to Mars.       Owing to their short focal lengths and compact design, the WA     optics (each is a 9-element all refractive design) and their     titanium housings are relatively insensitive to gravitational,     vibrational, and thermal loading.       The MOC optics/structure weighs 9.5 Kg, the primary mirror and     its mechanical assembly accounting for 3.4 Kg (36%).  The primary     mirror has been ligh",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:mgs.mola,MARS ORBITER LASER ALTIMETER for MGS,MARS ORBITER LASER ALTIMETER,"     Instrument Overview   ===================     The principal components of MOLA are a diode-pumped, Nd:YAG laser     transmitter that emits 1.064 micrometer wavelength laser pulses, a     0.5 m diameter telescope, a silicon avalanche photodiode detector,     and a time interval unit with 10 nsec resolution.  When in the     Mapping Phase of the mission, MOLA provides measurements of the     topography of Mars within approximately 120 m diameter footprints     and a center-to-center along-track footprint spacing of 300 m along     the MGS nadir ground-track.  The elevation measurements are     quantized with 1.5 m vertical resolution by the 100 MHz timing     interval unit (TIU) and an interpolator, giving it effectively     0.375 m resolution.  MOLA profiles are adjusted for orbit and     pointing errors using 66 million altimetric crossover constraints.     MOLA profiles are assembled into global planetocentric grids     referenced to Mars' center-of-mass with an absolute accuracy of     approximately 1 m.  Standard data products include NASA level 0     (CODMAC Level 2) corrected telemetry, NASA level 1a (CODMAC Level 3)     profiles in  engineering and geophysical units, and NASA level 2     (CODMAC Level 5) maps at various resolutions of planetary shape     (radius) areoid (equipotential datum surface), topography     (shape-equipotential), and maps of shot counts per bin. With roughly     10,000 usable orbital profiles, each with ascending and descending     equator crossings, mapping resolution is limited mainly by the     across-track spacing of individual orbits, and by the along-track     spacing of MOLA footprints.  At 1/32 degree by 1/32 degree per     pixel, more than one half of all pixels contain at least one     observation, while higher density occurs at the poles. Products at     resolutions of up to 128 pixels per degree are available, in     factor-of-two increments, interpolated where necessary by     minimum-curvature surfaces under tension [SMITH&WESSEL1990].     Special products include images of topographic gradients, kilometer-     and footprint-scale roughness, and a global 0.25 x 0.25 degree grid     of 1.064 micrometer surface reflectivity.       All major components of MOLA except for the laser and telescope were     designed, built and tested at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center,     Greenbelt, MD.       On June 31, 2001, after firing 670 million shots during 4.5 years of     the primary and extended missions and undergoing several hundred     power cycles, MOLA ceased operation as an altimeter. A 100 MHz     timing oscillator signal, divided down to a 10 Hz interrupt,     degraded rapidly and then failed.  Laser firing, controlled in     hardware by the 10 Hz signal, is no longer possible, but the     receiver electronics are fully operational.  A software patch was     uplinked that records at high resolution the detector noise counts     in place of laser data, providing a radiometric signal. The     background noise counts from the MOLA receiver can be used as a     radiometric measurement in the 1.064 micron band.       In radiometer mode, MOLA is clocked by 8 Hz interrupts from the     spacecraft master clock, and the original MOLA 10 Hz interupt has     been masked.  Flight software sets the receiver threshold every 10     interrupts, to maintain an approximately constant rate of noise     triggers. Noise counts are recorded at every interrupt on channels     1 and 2, and the totals for a half-frame of 10 interrupts are     stored for all four channels in a compressed (pseudo-log) format.     The precision  of the measurement is limited by the statistics of     the approximately 1000 noise counts per shot. Summing channels 1     and 2 increases precision. Each half-frame constitutes a single     record with a duration of 1.25 seconds and provides 10 radiometric     measurements.  The threshold settings and noise counts are     interpreted radiometrically using an analytical model of the MOLA     receiver characteristics. This model [SUNETAL1992, SUNETAL2001] has     been calibrated with respect to preflight test data and in-flight     experience, as well as similar measurements obtained by the Mars     Global Surveyor Thermal Emission Spectrometer Bolometer and by the     Hubble Space Telescope. Precision orbit data describing the     instrument's position and target location has been added to each     record. The precision orbit data is supplied by the MOLA Science     Team.       MOLA Science Objectives   =======================     The primary MOLA objective is to determine globally the topography     of Mars at a level suitable for addressing problems in geology and     geophysics [ZUBERETAL1992, SMITHETAL1998].  Secondary objectives     include characterizing the 1.064 micrometer wavelength surface     reflectivity of Mars to contribute to analyses of global surface     mineralogy and seasonal albedo changes.  Other objectives include     addressing problems in atmospheric circulation and providing     geodetic control and topographic context for the assessment of     possible future Mars landing sites.

The instrument normally operates in a single     autonomous mode, in which it produces ranging measurements.     Surface topography estimates can be derived from these data, given     appropriate corrections for the position and attitude of the     spacecraft.       MOLA's transmitter is a Q-switched, Nd:YAG laser oscillator which     is pumped by a 44 bar laser array.  Each bar contains ~1000 AlGaAs     (Aluminum, Gallium Arsenide) laser diodes.  The Q-switch controls     the emission of the laser, and Nd:YAG refers to the composition of     the material that is optically excited to produce laser action:     Neodymium-doped Yttrium Aluminum Garnet. The laser emits 8.5-ns-wide     (full width at half the maximum pulse amplitude, FWHM) pulses at     1.064 micrometers.  The pulse repetition rate is 10 Hz. The     pulse energy was 45 mJ at the beginning of the Mapping Phase     and 20 mJ at end of mission.  Energy fluctuated somewhat as     temperature varied aboard the spacecraft, and dropped several times     when individual diode bars failed. The remaining diodes appear     to have been operating at full output when the firing signal     stopped.  The laser consumed 13.7 W when operating.       The development of a space-qualified, long-lifetime laser represents     one of the primary engineering challenges associated with MOLA.  For     comparison, the ruby flashlamp laser altimeters flown on the Apollo     15, 16 and 17 missions [KAULAETAL1972, KAULAETAL1973, KAULAETAL1974]     each operated for less than 10^4 laser pulses.  High     pulse-repetition-rate lasers with lifetimes on the order of 10^9     shots have been made possible due to breakthroughs in solid-state     laser technology, resulting in improvements in the peak power,     brightness, and availability of semiconductor diodes and arrays     [CROSSETAL1987, BYERETAL1988].  The key technological advance has     been the replacement of the flashlamp, which is the device that has     traditionally been used to pump optical energy into the laser rod,     with a highly efficient array of laser diodes.  While flashlamp     lasers fail catastrophically, diode-pumped lasers such as MOLA's     instead undergo a gradual degradation in energy output as individual     pump diodes fail.  Laser diodes also produce the required pump     energy only in a narrow region near the laser rod's absorption band,     which dramatically improves the laser's electrical to optical     efficiency.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:mgs.rss,RADIO SCIENCE SUBSYSTEM for MGS,RADIO SCIENCE SUBSYSTEM,"       Instrument Overview     ===================       The Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) Radio Science investigations       utilized instrumentation with elements on the spacecraft and       at the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN).  Much of this was       shared equipment, being used for routine telecommunications       as well as for Radio Science.  The performance and       calibration of both the spacecraft and tracking stations       directly affected the radio science data accuracy, and they       played a major role in determining the quality of the       results.  The spacecraft part of the radio science       instrument is described immediately below; that is followed       by a description of the DSN (ground) part of the instrument.         Instrument Specifications - Spacecraft     ======================================       The Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft telecommunications       subsystem served as part of a radio science subsystem for       investigations of Mars.  Many details of the subsystem are       unknown; its 'build date' is taken to be 1994-10-12, which       was during the Prelaunch Phase of the Mars Global Surveyor       mission.

Other components included two redundant Low-Gain Receive       antennas (LGR); two redundant Low-Gain Transmit antennas       (LGT); two redundant Command Detector Units (CDU); two       redundant Traveling Wave Tube Amplifiers (TWTA); a single       high-gain antenna (HGA); a single UltraStable Oscillator       (USO); miscellaneous cables, connectors, waveguides, and       switches; and a Ka-band Link Experiment (KaBLE).         The X-band capability reduced plasma effects on radio       signals by a factor of 10 compared with previous S-band       systems, but absence of a dual-frequency capability (both       S- and X-band) meant that plasma effects could not be       estimated and removed from radio data.         The spacecraft was capable of X-band uplink commanding and       simultaneous X-band downlink telemetry.  The MOT generated a       downlink signal in either a 'coherent' or a 'non-coherent'       mode, also known as the 'two-way' and 'one-way' modes,       respectively.  When operating in the coherent mode, the MOT       behaved as a conventional transponder; its transmitted       carrier frequency was derived coherently from the received       uplink carrier frequency with a 'turn-around ratio' of       880/749.  The nominal coherent downlink frequency was       8417716050 Hz.         In the non-coherent mode, the downlink carrier frequency was       derived from one of the spacecraft's on-board crystal-       controlled oscillators.  After warm-up, the 'auxiliary'       oscillator (AUX OSC) frequency was estimated to be       8417700000. Hz.  A temperature-controlled UltraStable       Oscillator (USO) was used as the frequency reference during       one-way Radio Science observations.

During Inner Cruise, maneuvers,       and spacecraft anomalies the TWTA output was fed to a low-       gain transmitting antenna.  Nominal Effective Isotropic       Radiated Power (EIRP) for both high- and low-gain antennas       is shown below:           Quantity                  Units     HGA          LGT                                          (Mapping) (Inner Cruise)         ------------------------  -----  --------- --------------         RF Power Output            dBm     44.23        44.23         Transmitter Circuit Loss   dB      -0.97        -1.37         Boresight Antenna Gain     dBi     38.72         6.90         Antenna Pointing Loss      dB      -0.30        -4.60                                            -----        -----              EIRP toward Earth     dB      81.68        45.16         The strength of a spacecraft carrier signal, and thus the       quality of the radio science data, depends on its modulation       state.  Mars Global Surveyor telemetry data were sent to       Earth at rates between 10 bits per second (bps) and 75       kilobits per second (kbps).  Minimum Pt/No ratio (total       signal power to receiver noise in 1 Hz bandwidth) was 43 dB       during Inner Cruise with LGT1 transmitting to a 34-m HEF       on the ground; this would support a data rate of at least 8       kbps.  For Outer Cruise Pt/No began at 76 dB and dropped       monotonically to 50 dB, the latter supporting a data rate       of 43 kbps.  During Mapping, Pt/No varied between 47 dB and       64 dB, allowing data rates to 34-m HEF antennas of at least       21 kbps.         The HGA consisted of a 1.5-meter Cassegrain reflector system       with a dual-frequency (X- and Ka-band) feed horn.       Reflector, subreflector, and struts were spares from the       Mars Observer mission.  The feed horn was a new Lockheed       Martin Astronautics (LMA) design consisting of co-located       X- and Ka-band elements.  A radome fabricated of reinforced       germanium-coated Kapton covered the entire HGA aperture to       protect the system from the predicted aerobraking thermal       environment.  TWTAs and associated components were enclosed       and mounted on the back of the HGA structure.         The HGA structure was mounted at the end of a 2-meter boom       with two gimbals to control azimuth and elevation pointing.       Certain parts of the sky were not visible with the HGA, but       pointing toward Earth was possible from all parts of the       orbit (see important exceptions described in the section       'Operational Considerations - Spacecraft' below).  The HGA       azimuth gimbal was used during Mapping to track the slowly       changing seasonal (apparent) motion of the Earth.  The HGA       elevation gimbal rotated at orbital rate to track the Earth       and was rewound every orbit during Earth occultation.  The       orbital rate was 0.051 deg/sec, and the rewind rate was       0.12 deg/sec.  Stepper motors controlled both gimbals. Step       size was 0.009375 deg; the stepping rate of approximately       5 per second was visible as a 5 Hz modulation in open-loop       Radio Science data collected after HGA deployment.         HGA performance is defined in terms of gain and beamwidth.       The table below summarizes some of those data.  Beamwidth is       half-power, full-width, one-way.

Science Objectives     ==================       Two different types of radio science experiments were       conducted with Mars Global Surveyor: radio tracking       experiments in which the magnitude and direction of the       planet's gravity field were derived from the Doppler (and,       sometimes, ranging) measurements, and radio propagation       experiments in which signal modulation detected on Earth       could be attributed to properties of the medium.  Several       variations of the radio propagation experiments were carried       out including radio occultations by the atmosphere of Mars       and scattering from its surface.  Measurements were also       obtained when the radio wave passed through the solar corona.           Gravity Measurements       --------------------         Measurement of the gravity field provides significant         constraints on inferences about the interior structure of         Mars.  Precise, detailed study of the spacecraft motion         in Mars orbit can yield the mass distribution of the         planet.  Topographic data obtained by the Mars Orbiting         Laser Altimeter (MOLA) forms a critical adjunct to these         measurements since only after the gravitational effects         are adjusted for topography can the gravity anomalies be         interpreted geophysically.           Studies of the gravity field emphasize both the global         field and local characteristics of the field.  The first         task is to determine the global field.  Doppler and range         tracking measurements yield accurate spacecraft trajectory         solutions.  Simultaneously with reconstruction of the         spacecraft orbit, observation equations for field         coefficients and a small number of ancillary parameters         can be solved.  This type of gravity field solution is         essential for characterizing tectonic phenomena and can         also be used to study localized features.  An early         gravity model based on MGS data was presented by         [SMITHETAL1999].  Later versions were described in         [LEMOINEETAL2001] and [YUANETAL2001].           'Short-arc' line-of-sight Doppler tracking measurements         obtained when the Earth-to-spacecraft line-of-sight is         within a few degrees of the orbit plane provide the         highest resolution of local features.  The results from         this type of observation typically are presented as         contoured acceleration profiles of specific features         (e.g., craters, volcanoes, etc.) or line-of-sight         acceleration maps of specific regions.  The high spatial         resolution of these products makes them especially useful         to geophysicists for study of features in the size range         of 300 to 1,000 km.  Because of the relative simplicity         of the data analysis, results can be available very soon         after the data are collected.           A by-product of the gravity field analysis is information         on the density structure of the upper atmosphere         [TRACADISETAL2001].           Radio Occultation Measurements       ------------------------------         Atmospheric measurements by the method of radio         occultation contribute to an improved understanding of         structure, circulation, dynamics, and transport in the         atmosphere of Mars.  These results are based on detailed         analysis of the radio signal received from MGS as it         entered and exited occultation by the planet.  Two phases         of the atmospheric investigation may be defined.  The         first is to obtain vertical profiles of atmospheric         structure with emphasis on investigation of large-scale         phenomena.  The second is to concentrate on studies of         scintillations in the signal, which provide information         on smaller scale variations -- e.g, turbulence.           Retrieval of atmospheric profiles requires coherent         samples of the radio signal that has propagated through         the atmosphere, plus accurate knowledge of the antenna         pointing and the spacecraft trajectory.  The latter was         obtained first from the MGS Navigation Team and later         from high quality orbits derived by the Team's own         gravity investigators.  Initial solutions from MGS         occultations provided atmospheric structure -- temperature         and pressure vs. absolute radius -- to altitudes as high         as about 50 km from the surface [HINSONETAL1999].           The spatial and temporal coverage in the radio occultation         experiments are determined by the geometry of the         spacecraft orbit and the dates and times at which         occultation data were acquired.  Since radio occultation         experiments were conducted on a regular basis using a         polar orbit, there was extensive occultation coverage at         high northern and southern latitudes (e.g., beyond 60         degrees).  Often several occultations were observed in         succession in each hemisphere at time spacings of less         than two hours.  Later in the primary mission, as the         orbit appeared to drift from edge-on to nearly broadside         as viewed from Earth, occultation points moved toward the         equator and the entry/exit angle approached grazing.         For several months in 1999, there were no occultations at         all.  More than 21000 neutral atmosphere profiles had         been derived from MGS radio occultations by the end of         the mission.           No scintillations which could be attributed to turbulence         were detected in the occultation data.           It is also possible to retrieve profiles of electron         density in the ionosphere from occultation data.  When         the density is high enough, it reduces the refractive         index of the medium (where the neutral atmosphere         increases the refractive index) causing the radio wave         phase to be advanced.  The methods for retrieval are         somewhat different since hydrostatic equilibrium cannot         be assumed in the plasma.  5600 electron density         profiles were derived from MGS data, mostly near the         terminator [BOUGHERETAL2001][BOUGHERETAL2004]         [WITHERSETAL2005].           Bistatic Surface Scattering Measurements       ------------------------------------------         For a few seconds before and after geometrical occultation         the HGA illuminated a small strip of surface as well as         the atmosphere.  Under some circumstances, an echo could be         observed from the surface.  For smooth surfaces, the echo         properties (particular the strength) could be related to the         surface dielectric constant through the Fresnel reflection         equations.  For rougher surfaces, diffraction and surface         wave phenomena may play a role.  Surface echoes were         sought during most occultation events and several thousand         were studied in some detail [TYLERETAL2001].           The spacecraft telecommunications antenna could also be         pointed toward the surface of the planet.  The strength         of the scattered signal from the illuminated area could         then be interpreted in terms of the dielectric constant         of the surface through the Fresnel equations; the         frequency dispersion of the signal could be related to the         texture of the surface at the reflecting point.  One such         experiment was conducted over the Mars Polar Lander/Deep         Space 2 site in May 2000 [SIMPSON&TYLER2001].           For some surface materials, the Fresnel equations do not         apply; most of the signal penetrates the surface and is         scattered by the volume below.  Clean water ice is known         to have these properties, and has been postulated as the         cause of anomalous scattering from the Galilean satellites         of Jupiter and from polar deposits on both Mercury and         Mars.  Interpreting such observations quantitatively is not         straightforward, but Mars Global Surveyor had the         potential for collecting such data in a bistatic geometry,         providing additional insight on the surface structure         and properties.  Although such observations were sought,         none were ever scheduled.           Search for Gravitational Waves       ------------------------------         During the MGS Cruise Phase, nearly continuous radio         tracking of the spacecraft was conducted.  At the same time         an effort was made to keep on-board spacecraft activity to         a minimum.  The objective during this period was to search         for evidence that gravitational waves were passing through         the solar system while the spacecraft was at maximum         separation from known massive bodies.  A gravitational wave         was expected to change the position and motion of the         spacecraft, the Earth, or both.  Two-way tracking was used;         both closed-loop and open-loop data were collected, the         latter being more sensitive but also more voluminous.  Sources         of gravitational waves have been postulated outside the solar         system [ANDERSONETAL1993][ESTABROOKETAL1995], but no         unambiguous detection of such radiation has ever been made.           Solar Scintillation and Faraday Rotation Experiments       ----------------------------------------------------         Solar scintillation and Faraday rotation experiments are         conducted to improve our understanding of the structure         and dynamics of the solar corona and wind.  Because Mars         orbits the Sun, spacecraft like MGS are transported behind         the solar disk, as seen from Earth.  Radio waves         propagating between MGS and Earth stations are refracted         and scattered (scintillation) by the solar plasma         [WOO1993].  Intensity fluctuations can be related to         fluctuations in electron density along the path, while         Doppler or phase scintillations can be related to both         electron density fluctuations and also the speed of the         solar wind.  Many plasma effects decrease as the         square of the radio frequency; scintillations are about an         order of magnitude stronger at X-band than Ka-band.         The first solar conjunction observed with MGS was on         12 May 1998; more data were collected and archived two         years later [BARBINIS2001].         Operational Considerations - Spacecraft     =======================================       Descriptions given above are for nominal performance.  The       spacecraft transponder system comprised redundant units,       each with slightly different characteristics.  As       transponder units age, their performance changes slightly.       More importantly, the performance for radio science depended       on operational factors such as the modulation state for the       transmitters, which cannot be predicted in advance.  The       performance also depended on factors which were not always       under the control of the Mars Global Surveyor Project.         Early in the Mapping phase, the HGA assembly encountered an       obstruction.  Two gimbals allowed the HGA to point toward       Earth; the elevation gimbal rotated the HGA in the orbit       plane, and the azimuth gimbal pointed the HGA out of the orbit       plane at the Earth 'beta' angle.  The obstruction prevented       the azimuth gimbal from pointing at any beta angle less than       41.5 deg.  After the anomaly (1999-04-15) and until the beta       angle exceeded 41.5 deg (1999-05-06), the spacecraft was       operated in the Fixed High Gain Antenna (FHGA) configuration.       The Earth beta angle dropped below 41.5 deg again in February       2000 and remained there until June 2001, during which the       spacecraft was operated in the 'Beta Supplement' mode.         In Beta Supplement the spacecraft was oriented so that the       azimuth gimbal could be set to the supplement of the beta angle;       the elevation gimbal was flipped.  The supplement to the beta       angle ranged from 139 to 183 deg during the second year of       Mapping.  But there was physical interference between the HGA       and its boom; and HGA rewinds, which normally occurred while       the spacecraft was occulted, now took place on the 'front'       side of the planet.  The boom interference precluded collection       of occultation egress measurements during most of Mapping; the       HGA rewind reduced the amount of nearside radio tracking that       could be captured.         During normal operations, the spacecraft sensed solar       eclipses; a pre-programmed timing offset initiated onboard       radio occultation activities so that orbit prediction errors       would not affect collection of occultation data.  During Beta       Supplement, all occultation times were derived from the MGS       Navigation Team Orbit Propagation and Timing Geometry file;       when the OPTG predicted occultation time was in error by more       than about 40 s, occultation data were lost (for example on       2001-02-06 and 2001-02-07).         The HGA azimuth obstruction mysteriously disappeared during a       'safe' mode event which ended on 2005-09-28.  After testing,       the spacecraft was allowed to fly in its normal (non-Beta       Supplement) configuration for the remainder of the mission.       And, when other restrictions were not imposed, occultations       at both ingress and egress were recorded.         Calibration Description - Spacecraft     ====================================       No information available.         Platform Mounting Descriptions - Spacecraft     ===========================================       Origin of the spacecraft reference frame was located at the       intersection of the spacecraft/launch vehicle interface       plane and the spacecraft central axis -- that is, at the       bottom of the propulsion unit nozzle. The spacecraft +Z axis       was along the spacecraft central axis and normal to the       nadir equipment deck; the main engine was aimed in the -Z       direction.  The +X axis vector was in the direction of the       velocity vector during Mapping.  +X was also in the       direction of the HGA boresight during Cruise, and the HGA       boom was mounted to the +X panel of the propulsion module.       The +Y axis completed an orthogonal rectangular coordinate       system.  The +/-Y axes defined generally the deployment       directions of the solar panels.  The solar cells themselves       were on the -Z sides of the panels.         The primary LGT was mounted on the TWTA enclosure, which       was mounted on the rim of the HGA reflector; its boresight       was aligned with the HGA boresight, which was in the +X       direction until HGA deployment.  The backup (LGT2) was also       mounted on the TWTA enclosure; its boresight was aligned at       a cant angle approximately 160 degrees away from the shared       boresights of the HGA and LGT1. This angle was chosen to       minimize the consequences of a gimbal failure once HGA       articulation began after deployment of the HGA boom in the       mapping orbit.  LGT2 was not used prior to HGA deployment       because its orientation and proximity to the nadir payload       deck would lead to irradiation of the payload instruments       while the HGA was in its stowed position.  One LGR was       mounted on the -X panel of the equipment module; the other       was on the +X side of the propulsion module.         The five MGS antennas -- HGA, primary and backup low-gain       transmitting antennas (LGT1 and LGT2, respectively) and       low-gain antennas for receiving on the +X and -X sides of       the spacecraft (LGR1 and LGR2, respectively) are shown       below in their stowed (pre-HGA deployment) configuration.       Note that dimensions are given in inches; one inch (1 in)       equals 0.0254 meters.           -Y Side View:                               ^ S/C +Z Axis                             |                             |                             |  +39.318 in                             |<----------->|                             |             |                             | +39.318 in  |                             |<--------->| |                             |           | |                             | +20.72 in | |                             |<-->|      | |                    -25.81 in|                     |<----->|  LGT2 __LGT1                     |       |    @=|  |=@   ----------------                     |       |      |  | __               ^                     |       |      |__|/  |              |                     | +-----------+   /   |              |                     | |           |  /    |              |+81.46 in                     | |           | /     |              |                     | |           ||      |              |              LGR2   | |           ||  HGA | ------       |               ----- @=|           ||      |     ^        |                 ^     |-----------| \     |     |        |                 |     |           |  \    |     |        |                 |     |               \   |     |        |                 |     |     +31.75 in  \__|     |        |                 |     |     |<----->|           |        |                 |     |     |       | LGR1      |+66.15  |                 |     |           |=@ ---       |   in   |                 |     +----+-+----+    ^        |        |                 |+49.94   / | \        |+17.56  |        |                 |   in   /  |  \       |   in   |        |                 v       /   |   \      v        v        v               -------- +----o----+  ------------------------>                             | S/C Frame                S/C +X Axis                             |   Origin             Top View:                               ^ S/C +Y Axis                             |                             |           __                                  LGR1  /  |      |                       +-----------+   /   |      v                  |    |           |=@/ ------------              0 in|    | S/C Frame | /     |      |+5.29 in                  v    |  Origin   ||  HGA |      |                ---- @=|     o     ||__    | ------------  --->                  ^  LGR2          ||  |   |  ^   ^    ^   S/C +X Axis                  |    |           ||  |   |  |        |                       |           ||  |   |  |-28.18  |                       +----+-+----+|  |   |  |   in   |-30.05 in                                    |  |\__|  v        |                                    |  |=@   ---       v                                  @=|__| ---------------------                                LGT2    LGT1           The geometrical center of the HGA (coordinates given below)       is taken to be the geometric center of the HGA reflector rim.

Each configuration had slightly       different performance, but the quantitative differences are       unknown.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:mgs.tes,THERMAL EMISSION SPECTROMETER for MGS,THERMAL EMISSION SPECTROMETER,"       Instrument Overview   ===================     The TES instrument consists of three sub-sections, the primary     one being a Michelson interferometer that produces spectra from     1700 to 200 cm-1 (~6 to 50 microns), at a spectral sampling of     either ~5 or ~10 cm-1 [CHRISTENSENETAL1992].  The instrument     cycle time, including collection of the interferogram, mirror     flyback, and electronic reset, is 2 sec for 10 cm-1 (single     scan) operation, and 4 sec for 5 cm-1 (double scan) operation.     The interferometer includes a visible interferometer that is     used to generate fringes which are used to control the linear     drive servo and to determine position in the interferogram.     This system uses two redundant neon lamps that produce an     emission line at 703.2 nm for fringe generation and a continuum     that is used for a quasi-white-light source for determination     of zero path difference.  The finite size and off-axis position     of the six detectors results in self-apodization and a spectral     shift that is a function of both distance from the axis and     optical frequency.  The resulting full-width half-maximum     (FWHM) value is ~12.5 cm-1 for 10 cm-1 sampling at 200 cm-1 and     15.4 cm-1 at 1650 cm-1.  For the corner detectors and at the     highest frequency (shortest wavelength) there is a significant     departure from the ideal, with a worst-case degradation to a     FWHM of ~24 cm-1.  Because all of the response functions have     the same area there is no loss in signal when viewing a smooth     continuum scene like Mars.  However, there will be a slight     loss in contrast of narrow spectral features due to broadening     of the spectral width.  Because the self-apodization is     considerable, the data will generally be used without further     apodization.  Separate fast fourier transform (FFT) algorithms     are used for the center and edge detectors in order to     partially correct for the different spectral shifts introduced     into these detectors.  As a result, the data generated by the     two FFTs will have approximately the same frequency sampling.

Scientific Objectives   =====================     The scientific objectives of the Thermal Emission Spectrometer     (TES) investigation include the following:       (1) Determine the composition and distribution of surface         materials.       (2) Determine the composition, particle size, and spatial and         temporal distribution of suspended dust.       (3) Determine the location, temperature, height, and water         abundance of H2O clouds.       (4) Determine the composition, seasonal behavior, total energy         balance, and physical properties of the polar caps.       (5) Determine the particle size distribution of rocks and fines         on the surface.       Calibration   ===========     The TES instrument was radiometrically, spectrally, and     spatially calibrated prior to delivery.  Three categories of     calibration requirements were considered: absolute accuracy of     all three bands, relative accuracy of spectral measurements     within the spectrometer, and calibration stability over the     lifetime of the instrument.  The spectrometer and thermal     bolometric channels were calibrated in a thermal/vacuum chamber     using blackbody reference sources operated over the expected     Martian temperature range of 130 to >310 K.  The calibration     sequence was repeated for instrument temperatures over the     operating temperature range.       The solar reflectance channels were calibrated under ambient     conditions using filament lamps traceable to National Institute     of Standards and Technology (NIST) standards and a diffuser     plate with known bidirectional reflectance distribution     function properties.  Altering the distance from the lamps to     the plate was used to vary the radiance over the expected     dynamic range.  The absolute accuracy of the calibration was     better than 5%.  This calibration was confirmed by measurements     in the thermal/vacuum chamber over the expected instrument     operating temperature range.       The inflight radiometric calibration is performed using     observations of space (zero level) and an internal blackbody     (gain).  The instrument has an unobstructed view to space with     the line of sight at 85 degrees from nadir in at least one     direction, with an unobstructed half angle of 10.75 degrees on     either side of this line of sight.  These calibration     measurements allow the instrument response function and zero     levels to be determined and removed from the measured spectra     prior to transmission to Earth.  This calibration is performed     internally to permit coadding of spectra from more than one     detector and from more than one measurement.  The internal     blackbody and lamp calibration sources will be viewed by     rotation of the pointing mirror, providing a complete     end-to-end system calibration.       Operational Considerations   ==========================     None       Detectors   =========     Each sensor array consists of uncooled deuterated triglycine     sulfate (DTGS) pyroelectric detectors.  A narrow bandpass     filter is used to isolate the emission line at 703.2 nm for     fringe generation and the continuum is used for a     quasi-white-light source for determination of zero path     difference.  A silicon photodiode detector is used for each of     these functions.       Electronics   ===========     The outputs from all TES channels are digitized at 16 bits,     processed, and formatted before being sent to the spacecraft     Payload Data Subsystem (PDS).  The outputs of the     interferometer receive the following processing within the     instrument before transfer to the PDS:       1) selectable apodization;     2) Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) of data from all six        interferometer channels;     3) correction for gain and offsets;     4) data editing and aggregation;     5) data compression; and     6) formatting for the PDS.       Filters   =======     None       Optics   ======     The interferometer telescope is a reflecting Cassegrain     configuration with a focal ratio of f/4 and an intermediate     field stop which limits stray light from being admitted to the     interferometer and aft optics sections of the optical system.     The afocal output beam of the telescope is 1.524 cm in     diameter.  After passing through the Michelson interferometer     the energy is focused by an off-axis mirror on to a 2 x 3 array     of field stops.  The focal ratio at the field stops is also     f/4.  Behind each stop is a field lens operating at     approximately f/1 and a pyroelectric detector.       A separate 1.5-cm-diameter reflecting telescope, collimated     with the main telescope and using the same pointing mirror, is     used for the thermal and albedo radiometer channels.  The     optical system consists of a single off-axis paraboloidal     mirror operating at f/8.       Location   ========     Payload deck of MGS (+Z panel), boresighted with MOC       Operational Modes   =================     The overall science objectives of the TES experiment will be     addressed during the standard mission through a variety of     observation types.  These include:       (1) nadir pointing observations of the surface and atmosphere         collected along the spacecraft groundtrack,       (2) surface mosaics constructed by observing a particular         region forward, nadir, and then aft along the groundtrack,       (3) limb observations produced by scanning the pointing mirror         to and across the limb, and       (4) emission phase functions produced by viewing a particular         region at a limited set of emission angles fore and aft.       In addition, the TES processor will operate in a wide variety     of data collection and processing modes that will allow great     flexibility in the types and data volume of observations that     will be made.  Substantial on-board data processing is     necessitated by data rate constraints.  A variety of observing     modes will be used.  These will be based on:       (1) combining outputs from selected combinations of detectors         (spatial averaging),       (2) retention of limited numbers of spectral points (spectral         editing) and       (3) averaging results over several instrument cycles (temporal         averaging).       Data modes will be selected, depending on position in the orbit     and on scientific requirements, that limit the variable data     flow into the internal TES buffer to an orbitally averaged     level consistent with the telemetry rate.  Internal tables will     be used to select between the possible operational modes.  For     example, the full sampling rate can be utilized over the     warmest region of the planet, whereas data can be spectrally     and spatially averaged at night and over the poles to decrease     the data volume while increasing the signal-to-noise ratio.     Control of the instrument parameters and processor activities     will be accomplished using an internal command language and     internal tables to select between the possible operational     modes.  These modes include control of the pointing mirror     position and motion, spectral selection, spatial and temporal     averaging and editing, and data compression.  The basic     instrument parameters will be set for each two-second     observation.  Sequences will be constructed to form a     self-contained set of observations; for example, calibration     observations followed by three minutes of nadir viewing.  Orbit     Schedules will be constructed from a list of Sequences, each     timed to begin at a specified time following the nighttime     equator crossing.       Two types of Schedules will run in parallel:       1) a basic observing plan designed to be used repetitively; and       2) a targeting Schedule to be used for specific, targeted        observations that vary from orbit to orbit.       Finally, a Mission Plan will be constructed and stored within     the instrument.  It will contain the Schedules for the next 3     to 18 days of operation.  Using this scheme the TES instrument     can be controlled completely internally using minimum number of     uplink commands, yet utilizing the full, inherent flexibility     of a microprocessor-controlled instrument.         Mapping Operations     ------------------       Because of the limited (9 km) cross-track FOV, the TES       instrument will build up a global image using multiple       orbits, with approximately 200 days required to obtain full       coverage at the equator.  During the mission, the TES could       observe each point on the equator three times and each point       on the planet an average of 4.7 times.  Given the likelihood       of dust obscuration during a substantial portion of the       mission, this coverage may be significantly reduced.  It will       therefore be necessary to acquire observations in a well       defined, systematic manner.  Seasons of highest surface       temperature will be chosen for surface compositional mapping,       and opportunities provided by increased spacecraft data rate       will be incorporated into the observing plan.  Observations       of temporal phenomena, such as dust storms, polar cap growth       and retreat, seasonal pressure variations, and atmospheric       phenomena, will be incorporated into the basic plan and       collected whenever possible.         Nadir Observations     ------------------       The nominal TES operating mode will provide a nadir oriented       view of the planet, utilizing all three of the cross-track       IFOVs.  These observations will be assembled as part of the       standard data reduction procedure into global maps of the       surface observations.         Emission Phase Angle Observations     ---------------------------------       Multiple emission angle observations will provide information       on the scattering properties of the surface and atmosphere       over regional areas.  Because of planetary rotation (0.24       km/sec at the equator) it will not be possible to view       exactly the same surface point at multiple emission angles on       a single spacecraft revolution.  However, regional       characteristics can be determined in one revolution and       observations from different revolutions may be combined to       refine surface photometric estimates.  Individual emission       angle sequences will consist of 2-5 off-nadir views spaced at       fixed angles.         Surface Mosaics     ---------------       The TES instrument has the capability to construct mosaics up       to 50 km wide by 110 km long from a single revolution with       little loss of spatial resolution by utilizing the planetary       rotation.  These observations will permit direct comparison       with Mars Observing camera and Viking images, and will permit       the study of regional features, such as dune fields, wind       streaks, and polar lanes on a single orbit.         Atmospheric Observations     ------------------------       A wide range of atmospheric observations will be accomplished       using the TES instrument.  These utilize both limb scans and       variable emission angle observations of the surface and       atmosphere.  The observing strategy uses a combination of       nadir sounding, fore and aft limb scans, and variable       emission angle (nominally+-60 deg ) observations to allow       retrieval of vertical temperature profiles, atmospheric       aerosol characterization, determination of condensates in the       north polar hood, measurement of water ice and vapor and       possibly O3, pressure retrievals under high surface       temperature conditions, and characterization of localized       dust storms.         Observing Strategy     ------------------       The TES flight software has been programmed with four default       operating modes to allow data collection immediately upon       instrument turn-on and in the event of an interruption in       instrument commanding.  This illustrates the level of       complexity and flexibility that can be programmed into the       TES observing strategy.  A default mode has been designed to       provide 28, uniformly spaced atmospheric limb observations,       distributed in both fore and aft viewing directions.  In       addition, it optimizes the data collection, with full       spectral and spatial data obtained during the day, 6 x 9 km       data at half spatial resolution collected over the poles, and       12 x 9 km data at full spectral resolution collected at       night.  Emission phase observations and limb occultation       observations are also collected to permit characterization of       polar ices, clouds, and the atmosphere.  Actual, mapping       orbit observations will vary from this default case, in order       to optimize seasonal viewing opportunities, but will probably       maintain the basic structure outlined above.

Calibration:   ============       Calibration processes are accomplished via both flight software     and ground processing software.  Flight software is used primarily     to accommodate variations in measurements due to spacecraft motion.     Ground based calibration is accomplished through a combination of     calibration data values (see COMIMI_0000) coupled with various     algorithms to generate particle flux from measured count rates.    Operational Considerations:   ===========================       The MIMI power consumption is nomially ~19.0 W.

Sensors:   ==========       The MIMI experiment consists of three independent sensors: Charge     Energy Mass Spectrometer (CHEMS), Ion Neutral Camera (INCA), and Low     Energy Magnetospheric Measurements (LEMMS).  Each sensor has specific     targeted energies and populations to be examined and collectively     provide the ability to fully characterize the energetic charged and     neutral particle population in the Saturnian Magnetosphere as well as     the Solar Wind, the Jovian Magnetosphere, and the Earth Magnetosphere.       Each sensor is a combination of geometric components, silicon     detectors, micrpchannel plates, and electronics/software components     that give them the ability to fully answer the missions scientific     objectives. When the spacecraft is spinning the MIMI sensors obtain     measurements over a full four pi steradians.  The different MIMI     sensors share common electronics and provide complimentary     measurements of energetic plasma distributions, composition, and     energy spectrum, and the interaction of that plasma with the extended     atmosphere and moons of Saturn.       The CHEMS sensor is mounted on the particles and fields instrument     pallet with a field of view of approximately 160 degrees in latitude     (bisected by the spacecraft x-y plane) by 4 degrees in azimuth     centered on the spacecraft -x axis. CHEMS measures ions from     approximately 3 to 220 KeV/e.       Frames diagram     --------------       All MIMI telescope directions are described in terms of the     spacecraft fixed frame.     CHEMS latitudinal field of view of 160 degrees is bisected by the     spacecraft x-y plane and its azimuthal field of view of 4 degrees     is centered on the spacecraft -x axis.      There are no otherwise specifically defined Cassini MIMI frames.     Electronics:   ============       Signals from the sensors are first processed by the analog     electronics and then by the digital processing unit (DPU). Analog     data are placed into the digital system and with respect to CHEMS     minimal processing is done.            The CHEMS sensor has a variable high voltage     potential to determine selection of particle based upon energy     and to then subsequently place particles into energy, mass, and/or     mass/charge bins.        The DPU unit's primary function is to catalog incoming particle     measurements based upon underlying logic and to count events in     accumulation bins.  The DPU also packages the data along with the     instrument housekeeping data (instrument states) and then integrated     into telemetry for broadcast to ground station.          Parameters that control the high voltage supplies, the selection     of priority counters etc, are expected to be updated periodically     under normal operating conditions.       Data compression and sampling techniques are used to maximize data     return within the bandwidth allocated to the experiment.

Operational Modes:   ===========================     The INCA detector has the capability to be placed in either ion mode     or neutral mode.  Ion mode indicates that the potential of the     deflection plates is set to zero so that ions are also counted along     with neutrals.  Neutral mode identifies that there is a potential     applied to the plates that will cause the ions to deflect away from     the entrance aperture and not be counted.  The efficiency of this     process is strongly dependent upon the applied plate potential.  The     applied plate potential is a configurable parameter within the system     and is based upon the science goals, dust environment, and the     expected plasma and high energy particle distributions.      Operational Considerations:   ===========================       The MIMI power consumption is nomially ~19.0 W.  Typical operations     include the capability to sense 6-7 orders of magnitude in particle     flux over a dynamic energy range for electrons of 30 KeV to 5 MeV and     for ions from 3 KeV to 160 MeV.

The INCA sensor is separately mounted and nearly co-aligned with the     remote sensing instruments, with a field of view of 120 degrees in     latitude and 90 degrees in azimuth, centered on a vector rotated 9.5     degrees toward the spacecraft +x axis from the -y axis. INCA makes two     different types of measurements.  It obtains the directional     distribution, energy spectra, and crude composition of magnetospheric     ions between 7 keV/nuc and 500 keV/nuc and it makes remote images of     the global distribution of the energetic neutral emission of hot     plasmas in the Saturnian magnetosphere, measuring the composition and     energy spectra of those energetic neutrals for each image pixel.

With      respect to INCA thebdata is shifted into appropriate bins based      upon the current spacecraft orientation and spin rates.          The INCA instrument has the ability through the     use of high voltage potentials applied to the aperture plates to     deflect ions away from the entrance slit and instead image     neutral particles.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:mimi.co,MAGNETOSPHERIC IMAGING INSTRUMENT for CO,MAGNETOSPHERIC IMAGING INSTRUMENT,"       Abstract:   =========       The Cassini Magnetospheric Imaging Instrument (MIMI)     consists of three separate sensors: the Charge Energy Mass     Spectrometer (CHEMS) sensor, the Low Energy Magnetospheric     Measurement (LEMMS) sensor, and the Ion Neutral Camera (INCA) . This combination of sensors provides the capability     to perform both global imaging and in situ measurements to study     the overall configuration and dynamics of Saturn's magnetosphere     and its interactions with the solar wind, Saturn's atmosphere,     Titan, the icy satellites and the ring particles.       The text of this instrument description has been abstracted from the     instrument paper [KRIMIGISETAL2004]:         Krimigis, S.M., Magnetosphere Imaging Instrument (MIMI) on the       Cassini Mission to Saturn/Titan, in Space Science Reviews, Springer       Science and Business Media, B.V., formerly Kluwer Academic       Publishers B.V., Vol. 114, No. 1-4, pp. 233-329, December 2004.       Scientific Objectives:   ======================       The MIMI instrument onboard the Cassini Orbiter has the following     primary goals at Saturn:     1.  Determine the global configuration and dynamics of hot plasma         in the magnetosphere of Saturn through imaging and in situ         measurements.     2.  Study the sources of plasma and energetic ions through in situ         measurements of energetic ion composition, spectra, charge         state, and angular distributions.     3.  Study magnetospheric substorm-like activity at Saturn.     4.  Determine through imaging the formation of clouds of neutral         hydrogen, nitrogen, and water products.     5.  Investigate the modification of satellite surfaces and         atmospheres through plasma and radiation bombardment.     6.  Study Titan's cometary interaction with Saturn's magnetosphere         via high resolution imaging and in situ measurements.     7.  Measure the high energy (E_elec > 1 MeV, E_p > 15 MeV) particle         component in the inner (L < 5 Rs) magnetosphere to assess         CRAND source characteristics.     8.  Study magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling through remote sensing         of aurora and in situ measurements of precipitating energetic         ions and electrons.     Calibration:   ============       Calibration processes are accomplished via both flight software     and ground processing software.  Flight software is used primarily     to accommodate variations in measurements due to spacecraft motion.     Ground based calibration is accomplished through a combination of     calibration data values (see COMIMI_0000) coupled with various     algorithms to generate particle flux from measured count rates.       Operational Modes:   ===========================     The INCA detector has the capability to be placed in either ion mode     or neutral mode.  Ion mode indicates that the potential of the     deflection plates is set to zero so that ions are also counted along     with neutrals.  Neutral mode identifies that there is a potential     applied to the plates that will cause the ions to deflect away from     the entrance aperture and not be counted.  The efficiency of this     process is strongly dependent upon the applied plate potential.  The     applied plate potential is a configurable parameter within the system     and is based upon the science goals, dust environment, and the     expected plasma and high energy particle distributions. There are no     other specific operational modes of the detectors.     Operational Considerations:   ===========================       The MIMI power consumption is nomially ~19.0 W.  Typical operations     include the capability to sense 6-7 orders of magnitude in particle     flux over a dynamic energy range for electrons of 30 KeV to 5 MeV and     for ions from 3 KeV to 160 MeV. Data quality is affected by direct sun     exposure into the instruments and INCA operations are tailored to     reduce the possibility of direct dust particle impacts into the sensor     aperture during ring crossings.

The CHEMS sensor is mounted on the particles and fields instrument     pallet with a field of view of approximately 160 degrees in latitude     (bisected by the spacecraft x-y plane) by 4 degrees in azimuth     centered on the spacecraft -x axis. CHEMS measures ions from     approximately 3 to 220 KeV/e.       The INCA sensor is separately mounted and nearly co-aligned with the     remote sensing instruments, with a field of view of 120 degrees in     latitude and 90 degrees in azimuth, centered on a vector rotated 9.5     degrees toward the spacecraft +x axis from the -y axis.

It obtains the directional     distribution, energy spectra, and crude composition of magnetospheric     ions between 7 keV/nuc and 500 keV/nuc and it makes remote images of     the global distribution of the energetic neutral emission of hot     plasmas in the Saturnian magnetosphere, measuring the composition and     energy spectra of those energetic neutrals for each image pixel.       The LEMMS sensor is double ended, with oppositely directed 15 degree     and 30 degree (full angle) conical fields of view (FOV).  LEMMS is     mounted on a rotation platform, with the spin axis parallel with the     spacecraft y axis, such that when rotating, the LEMMS telescopes sweep     through 360 degrees in the spacecraft x-z plane.  The LEMMS spin     mechanism failed on February 1, 2005.         Frames diagram     --------------       All MIMI telescope directions are described in terms of the     spacecraft fixed frame.     LEMMS telescopes rotate around the -y axis (in the x-z plane) with     the 15 degree (low energy) telescope at zero degrees when it is     pointing in the -z direction and hence the 30 degree telescope (high     energy) telescope is pointing along the +z axis.     CHEMS latitudinal field of view of 160 degrees is bisected by the     spacecraft x-y plane and its azimuthal field of view of 4 degrees     is centered on the spacecraft -x axis.     INCA is separately mounted and nearly co-aligned with the remote     sensing instruments with a latitudinal field of view of 120 degrees     and an azimuthal field of view of 90 degrees centered on a vector     rotated 9.5 degrees toward the spacecraft +x axis from the -y axis.       There are no otherwise specifically defined Cassini MIMI frames.     Electronics:   ============       Signals from the sensors are first processed by the analog     electronics and then by the digital processing unit (DPU). Analog     data are placed into the digital system and with respect to CHEMS     and LEMMS minimal processing is done.  With respect to INCA the     data is shifted into appropriate bins based upon the current     spacecraft orientation and spin rates.     All channel definitions are predefined by the electronics for     the LEMMS sensors and the CHEMS sensor has a variable high voltage     potential to determine selection of particle based upon energy     and to then subsequently place particles into energy, mass, and/or     mass/charge bins. The INCA instrument has the ability through the     use of high voltage potentials applied to the aperture plates to     deflect ions away from the entrance slit and instead image     neutral particles.  When the high voltage supply is turned off     then the instrument see both neutrals and ions.       The DPU unit's primary function is to catalog incoming particle     measurements based upon underlying logic and to count events in     accumulation bins.  The DPU also packages the data along with the     instrument housekeeping data (instrument states) and then integrated     into telemetry for broadcast to ground station.     Parameters that control the high voltage supplies, the selection     of priority counters etc, are expected to be updated periodically     under normal operating conditions.       Data compression and sampling techniques are used to maximize data     return within the bandwidth allocated to the experiment.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:mo.rss,RADIO SCIENCE SUBSYSTEM for MO,RADIO SCIENCE SUBSYSTEM,"         Instrument Overview     ===================       The Mars Observer spacecraft telecommunications subsystem was       to have served as part of a Radio Science instrument for       investigations of Mars.  The remainder of the 'instrument' was       located at ground stations of the NASA Deep Space Network       (DSN).  Much of the equipment at both ends was shared, being       used for routine telecommunications as well as for Radio       Science.  Radio data were themselves shared; Doppler and range       measurements were used to calculate the spacecraft trajectory       and to search for gravity waves.  Measurements of signal       parameters after waves had propagated through the       interplanetary medium were used to infer properties of the       medium, characterize small perturbations in spacecraft       attitude, and search for gravity waves.         Data included in this archive data set are from routine       tracking and special tests conducted while Mars Observer was in       its Cruise Phase between Earth and Mars.  Cruise operations       were used to improve operator proficiency in carrying out       activities related to radio science observations and to measure       the performance of various parts of the radio science and       ground data systems.         Instrument Overview - Spacecraft     ================================       Spacecraft Radio System: The spacecraft radio system was       constructed around a redundant pair of Mars Observer       Transponders (MOTs) which received at 7.2 GHz and transmitted       at 8.4 GHz, both of which are called 'X-band' frequencies.  The       exact transmitted frequency was controlled by the signal       received from a ground station or by an on-board oscillator.       The transponders provided the usual uplink command and downlink       data transmission capabilities.  The MOT also included a       ranging 'channel' which could be driven either by signals from       the ground for measurement of absolute range or by tones       generated on-board to enable measurement of differential range       between two ground stations.         An MOT generated a downlink signal in either a 'coherent' or a       'non-coherent' mode, also known as the 'two-way' and 'one-way'       modes, respectively.  When operating in the coherent mode, the       MOT behaved as a conventional transponder, its transmitted       carrier frequency being derived from the received uplink       carrier frequency with a 'turn-around ratio' of 880/749.  In       the non-coherent mode, the downlink carrier frequency was       derived from one of the spacecraft's on-board oscillators.         One of the on-board oscillators, the 'ultra-stable oscillator'       (USO), had been specially provided to serve as a precision       frequency reference for radio occultation experiments.  Built       by the Applied Physics Laboratory of John Hopkins University,       the USO was positioned within the spacecraft so as to minimize       its exposure to thermal variations and mechanical vibration.       The USO consisted of a quartz crystal resonator contained in a       temperature-controlled titanium dewar.  Its output frequency       was near 19.14 MHz.  The X-band carrier for non-coherent       downlink transmission was produced by multiplying the USO       output frequency by 440.  The Mars Observer USO was from a       newer generation than those flown on the Voyager and Galileo       spacecraft.  Its frequency stability, as characterized by the       Allan deviation and after accounting for linear drift, was       measured to be better than 2E-13 for integration times in the       range one to several hundred seconds.  This represents more       than an order of magnitude improvement in performance over the       Voyager and Galileo devices.  After a 25 day warm-up period,       the USO was expected to have a daily aging rate of 6E-11 and a       long term frequency change after five years of significantly       less than 1E-6.  Laboratory measurements also showed       state-of-the-art phase noise and spectral purity as well as       amplitude stability performance for a device of this type.       During Cruise, the USO drifted 0.2 Hz/day at its X-band output       frequency; Allan Deviation for the end-to-end non-coherent       system was consistent with the 2E-13 measurements before       launch.         Each MOT also contained a separate, 'auxiliary' oscillator       which could be used to generate the non-coherent downlink       carrier.  However, the frequency stability of the auxiliary       oscillators was about six to seven orders of magnitude poorer       than the USO.  They were, therefore, not applicable to these       radio science investigations.         The strength of a spacecraft carrier signal, and thus the       quality of the radio occultation data, depends on its       modulation state.  Mars Observer telemetry data were Manchester       encoded and then used to modulate a 1 MHz square wave       subcarrier which, in turn, modulated the X-band carrier.       Telemetry modulation typically resulted in carrier suppression       of either 15.2 dB (simultaneous transmission of science and       engineering telemetry) or 9.3 dB (engineering telemetry only).       The two-way ranging channel, when activated, suppressed the       carrier by about 0.2 dB; the differential range modulation       reduced the carrier by another 0.2 dB when in use.  Each       modulation type -- telemetry, range, and differential range       modulation -- could be switched on or off independently.         Traveling wave tube amplifiers, driven at saturation, amplified       the MOT output before the signals were radiated via (nominally)       a steerable 1.5 m diameter parabolic high gain antenna (HGA).       Effective isotropic radiated power was about 83 dBm.  In       contrast to past practice for planetary missions, the HGA was       mounted at the end of a 5.6 meter boom so that the phase center       of the antenna was about 6 meters from the spacecraft center of       mass.         Pertinent details of the subsystem are shown below:         Instrument Id                  : RSS       Instrument Host Id             : MO       Pi Pds User Id                 : LTYLER       Instrument Name                : RADIO SCIENCE SUBSYSTEM       Instrument Type                : RADIO SCIENCE       Build Date                     : N/A       Instrument Mass                : N/A       Instrument Length              : N/A       Instrument Width               : N/A       Instrument Height              : N/A       Instrument Manufacturer Name   : MOTOROLA           Principal Investigator       ----------------------         The Team Leader for the Radio Science Team was G.  Leonard         Tyler of Stanford University.         Scientific Objectives     =====================       Two different types of radio science experiments were to be       conducted with Mars Observer: radio tracking experiments in       which the magnitude and direction of the planet's gravity field       were derived from the Doppler and ranging measurements, and       radio propagation experiments in which modulation on the signal       received on Earth could be attributed to properties of an       occulting medium, such as the atmosphere of Mars.           Gravity Measurements       --------------------         Measurement of the gravity field provides significant         constraints on inferences about interior structure of Mars.         Precise, detailed study of the spacecraft motion in Mars         orbit would have yielded the mass distribution of the planet.         Topographic data obtained by the Mars Observer Laser         Altimeter (MOLA) would have formed a critical adjunct to the         measurements of the gravity field since only after the         gravitational effects are adjusted for topography can the         gravity anomalies be interpreted geophysically.  For example,         our present understanding of the geometrical flattening is         sufficiently uncertain that discussions as to whether or not         Mars is in hydrostatic equilibrium cannot be conclusive until         altimeter data are available; similarly, the large         uncertainty in the precession constant precludes knowledge of         individual moments of inertia.  Values for these basic         quantities derived from Mars Observer would have been useful         in studies of Mars' internal stress, radial density, and         internal temperature.           Studies of the gravity field would have emphasized both the         global field and local characteristics of the field.  The         first task was to determine the global field.  Doppler and         range tracking measurements spanning periods of several days         would have yielded accurate spacecraft trajectory solutions.         Simultaneously with reconstruction of the spacecraft orbit,         observation equations for approximately 2500 field         coefficients and a small number of ancillary parameters would         have been derived.  This type of gravity field solution is         essential for characterizing tectonic phenomena such as the         Tharsis bulge and can also be used to study localized         features.  Results were expected to be available some months         after the data were collected, although the final global         gravity field would not have been available for one or two         years after the end of the Mission.           'Short-arc,' line-of-sight Doppler tracking measurements         obtained when the Earth-to-spacecraft line-of-sight was         within a few degrees of the orbit plane were expected to         provide the highest resolution of local features.  The         results from this type of observation typically are presented         as contoured acceleration profiles of specific features         (e.g., craters, volcanoes, etc.) or line-of-sight         acceleration maps of specific regions.  The high spatial         resolution of these products makes them especially useful to         geophysicists for study of features in the size range of 300         to 1,000 km.  Because of the relative simplicity of the data         analysis, results can be available within a few weeks after         the data are collected.           Radio Occultation Measurements       ------------------------------         Atmospheric measurements by the method of radio occultation         were expected to contribute to an improved understanding of         the circulation, dynamics, and the transport of volatiles and         dust in the atmosphere of Mars.  These results would have         been based on detailed analysis of the radio signal received         from Mars Observer as it entered and exited occultation by         the planet.  Two coordinated investigations of the atmosphere         were planned within the Radio Science Team.  The first was to         focus on obtaining vertical profiles of atmospheric structure         with emphasis on investigation of large-scale phenomena,         while the second was to concentrate on studies of the         small-scale atmospheric structure that causes scintillations         in the radio signal.           Retrieval of atmospheric profiles requires coherent samples         of the radio signal that has propagated through Mars'         atmosphere, plus accurate knowledge of the spacecraft         trajectory.  The latter was to be obtained first from the         Mars Observer Navigation Team and later, internally, from         Radio Science Team gravity investigators.  Initial solutions         were expected to provide atmospheric structure -- temperature         and pressure vs.  absolute radius -- to altitudes of at least         50 km with about 240 m vertical resolution; these 'standard'         profiles were expected within 2-4 weeks of data acquisition.         After correction for diffractive propagation effects,         vertical resolutions of 10-20 m might have been obtained.         These 'high-resolution' profiles require an increase in the         complexity of retrieval algorithms, which were being revised         when the spacecraft was lost.  Measures of total columnar         content, surface pressure, planet radius at the occultation         point, and properties of the ionosphere, if detectable, would         have been obtained for each occultation.           The spatial and temporal coverage in the radio occultation         experiments would have been determined by the geometry of the         spacecraft orbit.  In the mapping phase of the mission, the         Mars Observer spacecraft was to circle Mars in a         low-altitude, sun-synchronous, near-polar orbit with a period         of about 117 min.  As most orbits of the spacecraft included         an occultation by Mars, this trajectory provided frequent         opportunities for radio occultation measurements of the         neutral atmosphere and ionosphere.  The occultations         generally occurred at high latitudes in both hemispheres.         The rotation of the planet between successive orbits would         have allowed systematic measurements at regular intervals of         about 29 degrees in longitude.  Although most occultations         were expected to be in polar regions, the view from Earth of         the sun-synchronous spacecraft orbit would have evolved         slowly in response to the orbital motions of Earth and Mars         about the Sun, yielding opportunities for occultation         measurements at a variety of latitudes and local times over         the course of the 687-day mission.         Operational Considerations     ==========================       Descriptions given here are for nominal performance.  The       spacecraft transponder system comprised redundant units, each       with slightly different characteristics.  As transponder units       age, their performance changes slightly.  More importantly, the       performance for Radio Science depended on operational factors       such as the modulation state for the transmitters, which cannot       be predicted in advance.  The performance also depended on       factors which were not always under the control of the Mars       Observer Project.         During radio occultation periods, telemetry modulation would       have been turned off; during many of the tests included in the       Cruise data set telemetry was also suspended.  No special       modulation requirements were required during routine tracking       for trajectory determination.         The steerable 1.5 m diameter parabolic high gain antenna (HGA)       was mounted at the end of a 5.6 meter boom so that the phase       center of the antenna was about 6 meters from the spacecraft       center of mass.  An area of concern to the Mars Observer Radio       Science and Navigation Teams was the set of 'pseudo-Doppler'       effects introduced into the radio tracking and occultation data       by motion of the HGA relative to the spacecraft center of mass;       it would have been necessary to remove these during data       reduction before deriving the gravity field or occultation       profiles.  Six sources of HGA motion were identified: (i) the       spacecraft rotation needed to maintain nadir pointing while in       orbit, (ii) articulation of the HGA to maintain Earth point,       (iii) HGA boom flexure, (iv) short term migration of the       spacecraft center of mass associated with effects such as       'sloshing' of propellants and motions of articulating booms,       (v) spacecraft attitude instability, and (vi) spacecraft       response to cycling of momentum wheels.  The first two error       sources are deterministic to the extent that their effects can       be taken into account accurately with rather straightforward       modeling.  Boom flexure was believed to be insignificant.       Other motions of the spacecraft center of mass were studied;       there were reasons to believe that they would not have proven       to be major problems.         Item (v) remained a concern at the time the spacecraft was       lost.  When first analyzed in 1987, tracking error from this       source alone was calculated to be nearly an order-of-magnitude       greater than that from the next largest source.  For the normal       'mapping' configuration, nadir pointing of the spacecraft would       have been controlled by referencing spacecraft attitude to the       Mars 'horizon' as defined by carbon dioxide emissions from the       atmosphere.  Atmospheric disturbances can affect determination       of the horizon, however, causing the spacecraft attitude to       deviate from the true nadir orientation.  Doppler error from       HGA motion, then, can be coupled to atmospheric features, some       of which are stable and associated with surface features (e.g.,       the semi-permanent waves associated with the Tharsis volcanoes,       and the winter polar hood).  This coupling would have made such       signatures difficult or impossible to distinguish in the data       from Doppler effects caused by the spacecraft response to       gravity features.  After the 1987 analysis, attitude control       design engineers at the spacecraft contractor (General       Electric, AstroSpace Division) and at the Jet Propulsion       Laboratory (JPL) implemented new control algorithms to reduce       spacecraft attitude response to local atmospheric features.  By       mid-1993, analytically predicted Doppler effects resulting from       HGA motion relative to the spacecraft center of mass no longer       represented the dominant error source for gravity field or       atmospheric occultation measurements.  Predicted errors       associated with the attitude control system remained       significant, however, and study of this question was       continuing.         Item (vi) was identified as a potential source of error only       after launch of Mars Observer.  Normal rotation of the       spacecraft resulted in transfer of angular momentum among the       on board momentum wheels.  At regular intervals, spaced by 90       degrees of rotation, one set of wheels or another would pass       through zero angular momentum and physically stop.  Static       friction prevented smooth resumption of wheel rotation as the       spacecraft continued turning; an attitude transient resulted,       which could last for several minutes.  Modeling of these       'sticksion' events based on reconstruction of attitude allowed       most Doppler effects to be removed from non-coherent Cruise       data.  But signal-to-noise ratios would have been considerably       higher during Mapping, and the accuracy to which this could       have been carried out under the best radio science observing       conditions remained a concern.         Calibration     ===========       No information is available on calibration of the radio system.         Operational Modes     =================       The Mars Observer telecommunications system could be viewed as       having two sections, which could be operated in the following       modes:           Section      Mode       -------------------------------------------       Oscillator   two-way (coherent)                    one-way (non-coherent)       RF output    low-gain antenna                    high-gain antenna         Selected parameters describing transponder performance are       listed below:         Oscillator Parameters:                      X-Band          Two-Way Transponder Turnaround Ratio     880/749          One-Way Transmit Frequency (MHz)         8423.200         RF Output parameters:                       X-Band          Power at HGA output                      46.5 dBm          High-Gain Antenna:            Gain (dBi)                             39.95            Polarization                           Right Circular           Instrument Overview - DSN     =========================       Three Deep Space Communications Complexes (DSCCs) (near       Barstow, CA; Canberra, Australia; and Madrid, Spain) comprise       the DSN tracking network.  Each complex is equipped with       several antennas [including at least one each 70-m, 34-m High       Efficiency (HEF), and 34-m standard (STD)], associated       electronics, and operational systems.  Primary activity at each       complex is radiation of commands to and reception of telemetry       data from active spacecraft.  Transmission and reception is       possible in several radio-frequency bands, the most common       being S-band (nominally a frequency of 2100-2300 MHz or a       wavelength of 14.2-13.0 cm) and X-band (7100-8500 MHz or 4.2-       3.5 cm).  Transmitter output powers of up to 400 kw are       available.         Ground stations have the ability to transmit coded and uncoded       waveforms which can be echoed by distant spacecraft.  Analysis       of the received coding allows navigators to determine the       distance to the spacecraft; analysis of Doppler shift on the       carrier signal allows estimation of the line-of-sight       spacecraft velocity.  Range and Doppler measurements are used       to calculate the spacecraft trajectory and to infer gravity       fields of objects near the spacecraft.         Ground stations can record spacecraft signals that have       propagated through or been scattered from target media.       Measurements of signal parameters after wave interactions with       surfaces, atmospheres, rings, and plasmas are used to infer       physical and electrical properties of the target.         Principal investigators vary from experiment to experiment.       See the corresponding section of the spacecraft instrument       description or the data set description for specifics.         The Deep Space Network is managed by the Jet Propulsion       Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology for the       U.S.  National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

Subsystems - DSN     ================       The Deep Space Communications Complexes (DSCCs) are an integral       part of the Radio Science instrument, along with other       receiving stations and the spacecraft Radio Frequency       Subsystem.  Their system performance directly determines the       degree of success of Radio Science investigations, and their       system calibration determines the degree of accuracy in the       results of the experiments.  The following paragraphs describe       the functions performed by the individual subsystems of a DSCC.       This material has been adapted from [ASMAR&HERRERA1993]; for       additional information, consult [DSN810-5].         Each DSCC includes a set of antennas, a Signal Processing       Center (SPC), and communication links to the Jet Propulsion       Laboratory (JPL).  The general configuration is illustrated       below; antennas (Deep Space Stations, or DSS -- a term carried       over from earlier times when antennas were individually       instrumented) are listed in the table.               --------   --------   --------   --------   --------          | DSS 12 | | DSS 18 | | DSS 14 | | DSS 15 | | DSS 16 |          |34-m STD| |34-m STD| |  70-m  | |34-m HEF| |  26-m  |           --------   --------   --------   --------   --------               |            |     |             |          |               |            v     v             |          v               |           ---------            |     ---------                --------->|GOLDSTONE|<----------     |EARTH/ORB|                          | SPC  10 |<-------------->|   LINK  |                           ---------                  ---------                          |   SPC   |<-------------->|   26-M  |                          |  COMM   |         ------>|   COMM  |                           ---------         |        ---------                               |             |            |                               v             |            v              ------       ---------         |        ---------             | NOCC |<--->|   JPL   |<-------        |         |              ------      | CENTRAL |                |   GSFC  |              ------      |   COMM  |                | NASCOMM |             | MCCC |<--->| TERMINAL|<-------------->|         |              ------       ---------                  ---------                                                       ^     ^                                                       |     |                    CANBERRA (SPC 40) <----------------      |                                                             |                      MADRID (SPC 60) <----------------------                             GOLDSTONE     CANBERRA      MADRID              Antenna        SPC 10       SPC 40       SPC 60             --------      ---------     --------     --------             26-m            DSS 16       DSS 46       DSS 66             34-m STD        DSS 12       DSS 42       DSS 61                             DSS 18       DSS 48       DSS 68             34-m HEF        DSS 15       DSS 45       DSS 65             70-m            DSS 14       DSS 43       DSS 63             Developmental   DSS 13           Subsystem interconnections at each DSCC are shown in the       diagram below, and they are described in the sections that       follow.

The DMC is the center of activity at a DSCC.  The         DMC receives and archives most of the information from the         NOCC needed by the various DSCC subsystems during their         operation.  Control of most of the DSCC subsystems, as well         as the handling and displaying of any responses to control         directives and configuration and status information received         from each of the subsystems, is done through the DMC.  The         effect of this is to centralize the control, display, and         archiving functions necessary to operate a DSCC.         Communication between the various subsystems is done using a         Local Area Network (LAN) hooked up to each subsystem via a         network interface unit (NIU).           DMC operations are divided into two separate areas: the         Complex Monitor and Control (CMC) and the Link Monitor and         Control (LMC).  The primary purpose of the CMC processor for         Radio Science support is to receive and store all predict         sets transmitted from NOCC such as Radio Science, antenna         pointing, tracking, receiver, and uplink predict sets and         then, at a later time, to distribute them to the appropriate         subsystems via the LAN.  Those predict sets can be stored in         the CMC for a maximum of three days under normal conditions.         The CMC also receives, processes, and displays event/alarm         messages; maintains an operator log; and produces tape labels         for the DSP.  Assignment and configuration of the LMCs is         done through the CMC; to a limited degree the CMC can perform         some of the functions performed by the LMC.  There are two         CMCs (one on-line and one backup) and three LMCs at each DSCC         The backup CMC can function as an additional LMC if         necessary.           The LMC processor provides the operator interface for monitor         and control of a link -- a group of equipment required to         support a spacecraft pass.  For Radio Science, a link might         include the DSCC Spectrum Processing Subsystem (DSP) (which,         in turn, can control the SSI), or the Tracking Subsystem.         The LMC also maintains an operator log which includes         operator directives and subsystem responses.  One important         Radio Science specific function that the LMC performs is         receipt and transmission of the system temperature and signal         level data from the PPM for display at the LMC console and         for inclusion in Monitor blocks.  These blocks are recorded         on magnetic tape as well as appearing in the Mission Control         and Computing Center (MCCC) displays.  The LMC is required to         operate without interruption for the duration of the Radio         Science data acquisition period.           The Area Routing Assembly (ARA), which is part of the Digital         Communications Subsystem, controls all data communication         between the stations and JPL.  The ARA receives all required         data and status messages from the LMC/CMC and can record them         to tape as well as transmit them to JPL via data lines.  The         ARA also receives predicts and other data from JPL and passes         them on to the CMC.           DSCC Antenna Mechanical Subsystem       ---------------------------------         Multi-mission Radio Science activities require support from         the 70-m, 34-m HEF, and 34-m STD antenna subnets.  The         antennas at each DSCC function as large-aperture collectors         which, by double reflection, cause the incoming radio         frequency (RF) energy to enter the feed horns.  The large         collecting surface of the antenna focuses the incoming energy         onto a subreflector, which is adjustable in both axial and         angular position.  These adjustments are made to correct for         gravitational deformation of the antenna as it moves between         zenith and the horizon; the deformation can be as large as 5         cm.  The subreflector adjustments optimize the channeling of         energy from the primary reflector to the subreflector and         then to the feed horns.  The 70-m and 34-m HEF antennas have         'shaped' primary and secondary reflectors, with forms that         are modified paraboloids.  This customization allows more         uniform illumination of one reflector by another.  The 34-m         STD primary reflectors are classical paraboloids, while the         subreflectors are standard hyperboloids.           On the 70-m and 34-m STD antennas, the subreflector directs         received energy from the antenna onto a dichroic plate, a         device which reflects S-band energy to the S-band feed horn         and passes X-band energy through to the X-band feed horn.  In         the 34-m HEF, there is one 'common aperture feed,' which         accepts both ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:mpfr.apxs,ALPHA PROTON X-RAY SPECTROMETER for MPFR,ALPHA PROTON X-RAY SPECTROMETER,"     Instrument Overview   ===================     The Alpha/Proton/X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) is a foreign-provided     copy of an instrument design flown on the Russian Vega, Phobos,     and Mars '96 missions.  Thus, the instrument has extensive,     applicable flight heritage.  The alpha and proton spectrometer     portions were provided by the Max Planck Institute, Mainz     Germany.  The X-Ray spectrometer portion was provided by the     University of Chicago.  Integration of the instrument portions     was the responsibility of the Principal Investigator.       This elemental analysis instrument consists of nine curium-244     alpha-particle sources and three detectors for each of three     types of particles: backscattered alpha particles, protons, and     X-rays.  The APX spectrometer was placed against rocks and soils     on Mars to determine the abundances of all elements except     hydrogen, with a lower detection limit of about 0.1 weight     percent.  The analytical process is based on three interactions     of alpha particles with matter: elastic scattering of alpha     particles by nuclei, alpha-proton nuclear reactions with certain     light elements, and excitation of the atomic structure of atoms     by alpha particles leading to the emission of characteristic     X-rays.  The approach used is to expose material to a radioactive     source that produces alpha particles with a known energy, and to     acquire energy spectra of the alpha particles, protons and X-rays     returned from the sample.       The basis of the alpha mode of the instrument is the dependence     of the energy spectrum of alpha particles scattered from a     surface on the composition of the surface material.  The method     has the best resolving power for the lighter elements (carbon and     oxygen).  A least-squares analysis of a complex spectrum from an     unknown sample in terms of a library of known, pure element     spectra determines the elements and their abundance in the     sample.  A characteristic of the alpha technique is that, due to     variations in scattering intensity with atomic number, there is a     minimum in the scattering probability for elements with atomic     numbers between 9 and 14.  This includes the important elements     Na, Mg, and Al, so the alpha mode alone is insufficient for these     elements.  On the other hand, these elements produce protons when     bombarded with alpha particles.  The proton spectra for alpha     particles interacting with elements with atomic numbers from 9 to     14 are very characteristic of the individual elements, reflecting     the resonance nature of the nuclear interactions involved.  The     proton mode allows their detection and measurement.  The alpha     particles from the radiation sources are also an efficient source     for production of characteristic X-rays.  The addition of a third     detector for X-rays therefore results in a significant extension     of the accuracy and sensitivity of the instrument, particularly     for the heavier, less abundant elements.  In the X-ray technique,     characteristic X-rays are emitted when the low electron orbit     vacancies (in the K- and L-shells) produced by bombardment of     atoms by alpha particles are filled by electrons from higher     orbits.       The APXS electronics are mounted in the rover warm electronics     box in a temperature-controlled environment.  Cables leaving the     electronics box connect the APXS electronics to the APXS sensor     head, which contains the radioactive sources and particle     detectors.  The instrument sensor head is held by a robotic arm     (deployment mechanism) attached to the back of the rover.  The     deployment mechanism, which places the APXS in contact with rock     and soil surfaces, interfaces the APXS with the microrover.  For     the APXS to conduct a high quality measurement of a rock or soil     sample, it must be placed with its front aperture ring in contact     with the sample surface and the axis of the sensor head must be     within 20 degrees of normal to the surface.  The linkage is     designed to allow the APXS to be placed at a variety of     elevations above nominal ground level and at a variety of     rotational orientations.  The mounting of the APXS to the     deployment mechanism permits about 20 degrees of compliance     motion as the APXS is placed in contact with the sample.  Three     contact sensors on the deployment mechanism bumper ring indicate     to the rover that the positioning is complete, thereby     terminating the positioning motions.  The sources and detectors     are recessed in a cylinder 4 cm behind the bumper and the area of     rock or soil that is analyzed with the instrument is a circle 5     cm across.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:mpfr.rclt,ROVER CAMERA LEFT for MPFR,ROVER CAMERA LEFT,"     Instrument Overview   ===================     The rover, named 'Sojourner', was essential to the achievement of     the major scientific goals of the Pathfinder mission because it     carried the Alpha Proton X-ray Spectrometer, or APXS, that     analyzed rocks and other surface materials.  Aside from     transporting the APXS, the rover also contributed scientifically     by carrying three cameras that yielded a large quantity of image     data.  The discussion of the rover 'instrument' per se in this     section will focus on the salient characteristics of the three     cameras, and not of the APXS.  For a complete discussion of the     latter, see the instrument description for the APXS.       Two front monochromatic camera/laser systems provided stereo     viewing and ranging, while the rear mounted camera was     discriminant in the red, green, and IR spectral bandwidths to     produce color images.  Whereas the Imager for Mars Pathfinder     (IMP) camera viewed the Martian scenes from a fixed platform at     spatial resolutions that diminished with distance, the mobile     rover was able to drive up to landforms, including those hidden     from the IMP, to image them at higher resolution.       The rover cameras were built by the Microrover Flight Experiment     Team at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.       Scientific Objectives   =====================     The rover's Primary Mission was planned for seven sols (Martian     days).  The rover was designed to interact with slightly more     than 300 square meters of Martian terrain, though initial     operations were conducted within a limit of 10 meters or less of     the lander.       Primary objectives for the rover were 1) exit the lander as early     as practical on the basis of lander stereoscopic images, 2) send     initial vehicle performance and technology experiment data to the     lander, 3) move a few meters and repeat objective #2, 4) acquire     and transmit images showing the condition of the lander, 5)     acquire images at the end of daily traverses for navigation     purposes, or encounter, acquire, and transmit an image of a rock     or soil patch for subsequent APXS analysis, 6) deploy APXS on the     imaged rock or soil patch, if possible, for 1 to 10 hours     duration for chemical analysis, 7) query the APXS for final data     and transmit interim and final data to the lander, and 8)     traverse diverse terrains and repeat objective #2.       An Extended Mission of 30 sols was planned and more than     realized, as the governing spacecraft, rover and site-related     factors permitted rover activities to continue for 81 sols.     Extended Mission objectives were similar to the Primary     objectives, with technology experiments amended to explore the     diverse terrains further away from the lander.       As during the Primary Mission, Extended operations of the rover     cameras were to yield a high resolution image dataset critical     for navigation purposes and geologic analysis of structures in     rocks and soil-like materials.  The rover image data were to     contribute to the technology experiments by affording high     resolution stereoscopic and multispectral examination of 1)     features targeted for APXS chemical analysis, 2) slumped or     eroded surface material that had been excavated by the churning     rover wheels, 3) aeolian effects on the exposed, upturned     material, and 4) overturned rocks.  This would aid in achieving     the scientific objective of better understanding surface material     properties such as grain size, bulk density, friction angle,     cohesion, and compressibility, which could then be put in the     larger context of geologic features seen in the lander IMP     images.       Of the ten Technology Experiments, rover camera images were     acquired to support the following six: a) Terrain     Characterization, b) Basic Soil Mechanics, c) Wheel Abrasion, d)     Thermal Characterization, e) Dead Reckoning and Path     Reconstruction, and f) Vision Sensor Performance.  For a     description of these experiments, refer to [MATIJEVICETAL1997A].       Subsystems   ==========     There were three imaging subsystems aboard the rover.  Two     broad-band monochrome camera/laser systems were located on the     forward part of the rover, and a third camera was located on the     aft part near the APXS.  The two front cameras, used in     conjunction with laser stripe projectors for hazard detection,     provided images for stereoscopy and measurements.  The aft     camera, which was rotated 90 degrees, provided spectral     information while imaging the APXS target area, rover tracks, and     terrain.       The 'cameras' were CCDs clocked out by the rover Central     Processing Unit (CPU).  The camera systems were capable of     auto-exposure, block truncation coding (BTC) data compression,     bad pixel/column handling, and image data packetizing.       The major components of the camera systems are described in     detail below.       Detectors   =========     Front Camera Specifications:       CCD array size        : 484 (vertical) x 768 (horizontal) pixels     Pixel size            : 13.6 um (vertical) x 11.6 um (horizontal)     Full well             : 60,000 electrons                             (manufacturer claims 80,000)     Output sensitivity    : 10 uV/electron     Dynamic range         : > 60 dB     Dark Noise            : 40 electrons rms     Dark Current          : < 0.5 nA/cm**2     Blooming suppression  : > 300 X     Maximum Data Rate     : 14.3 MHz     Image lag             : negligible       Aft Camera Specifications:       Same as the Front Camera specs, except that the CCD chip was     engineered as a Color Filter Array.  The pixels were arranged in     a 'field-staggered 3G' color mosaic filter pattern.  In each 4 x     4 pixel block, 12 were green sensitive, 2 were red sensitive and     2 were blue sensitive.  The blue pixels were sensitive to both     blue and infrared wavelengths.  Given that the camera optics     blocked out much of the light in the blue part of the spectrum,     the 'blue' pixels were essentially infrared pixels.  (More     information about the aft, color CCD is available in     [DLUNA&FROSINI1992] and [PARULSKIETAL1992].) The pixel map for     the color CCD is as follows:                             G R G R                           G G G G                           B G B G                           G G G G       This map repeats in both the row and column directions.  This is     the orientation of the pixel map for a rotated image, and thus     will have to be rotated 90 degrees to match the color map     published by the manufacturer of the CCD (Eastman Kodak Company).       Optics   ======     Optical Material:       There were three elements that made up the optical subsystem: 1)     camera window, 2) objective lens, and 3) field flattener lens.     Their material makeup included optical grade sapphire and zinc     selenide.  This was significant in that the zinc selenide     effectively blocked transmittance of most Blue light.  For a     diagram of the optical elements, see document [SEPULVEDA1994].       Camera window        : Optical grade sapphire     Objective lens       : Optical grade zinc selenide     Field Flattener lens : Optical grade zinc selenide       General Camera Features:       The resolving power of the rover cameras contributed     significantly to the technology experiments measuring grain sizes     in surface material.  The rover cameras were designed to be able     to resolve fragments about 0.6 to 1.0 cm across at a nominal     range of 0.65 m.  Closer viewing of the surface near the wheels     could reduce these sizes by four-tenths, and special situations     (ie., close-up views of a rock 20 cm high) could reduce these     values by as much as one-tenth.       Lens focal length                : 4 mm     Forward camera separation        : 12.56 cm     Approximate height above surface : 26 cm       Fields of View:       Forward cross track     : 127.5 deg     Forward along track     : 94.5 deg     Aft cross track         : 94.5 deg     Aft along track         : 127.5 deg     Forward Boresight Angle : -22.5 deg     Aft Boresight Angle     : -41.4 deg       Average Spatial Resolution per Pixel:       Spatial resolution is the product of the distance of an object or     surface from the camera and the camera resolution (in mrad/pixel).     To calculate the average spatial resolutions, a camera resolution     of 0.003153 mrad/pixel was used.       Forward cross track : 0.166 deg (2.897 mrad)     Forward along track : 0.195 deg (3.409 mrad)     Aft cross track     : 0.195 deg (3.409 mrad)     Aft along track     : 0.166 deg (2.897 mrad)       Filters   =======     The zinc selenide material contained in the camera fore optics     (see Optical Material above) served to filter out most light     transmitted in the Blue region below 500 nm.  This effect applied     to all cameras.       The filter on the front cameras was to have a peak transmittance     of 97% at the central wavelength, which is defined as W = 860 nm     +30 nm / -30 nm.       For every 4x4 block of pixels in the aft Color Filter Array, 12     were green, two were red, and two were infrared, allowing     multispectral imaging of surface materials.  Compared to the     response for the red and green pixels, that of the infrared     pixels was low.  When exposure time was increased to improve the     dynamic range of the infrared pixels, the impact was negative as     light bled from the red and green pixels into the infrared     pixels.  As a result, the aft color camera was most useful in     providing red and green color information.  For a schematic     diagram showing the relative spectral responses of the aft color     camera, see Figure 5 in the [MATIJEVICETAL1997A].       Forward Wavelength Sensitivity : 830 - 890 nm     Aft Wavelength Sensitivity     : 500 - 900 nm       Operational Modes   =================     Many optional command parameters are available to control the     exposure and processing.  These include everything from exposure     time to the amount and type of data compression.  All of this     information is attached to the image headers.       Laser ranging:       Proximity scanning using the lasers was controlled by a table of     camera/laser combinations.  For each combination, a list of     calibrated scan lines was stored.  For each laser at each line,     the nominal spot position, first-order scaling of pixel offset to     height, and correction scale factors for pitch and roll were     stored.       Image capture:       Image capture was executed by applying low-level functions to     manage the acquisition, readout, and optionally, compression of     the data.  Valid image data were in rows 6 through 489 and     columns 0 through 767; row 490 contained dark reference pixels.     The data was packetized for telemetry, with enclosed identifiers     describing the exposure (in milliseconds) and image region.       Auto exposure determination was indicated by an exposure time of     zero.  Given an image region, an overexposed image was taken and     the brightest (saturated) pixel found.  Then a geometric search     of exposure times was performed, until an image was found with an     average pixel value between 40% and 50% of saturation.  Finally,     exposure time was reduced by 25% as many times as necessary until     no more than 1% of the pixels were within 5% of saturation.  An     exposure time of 1 indicated that the last computed auto exposure     time was re-used.  If no auto exposure had been performed since     the last wakeup, a new auto exposure time was determined.       As part of the auto exposure, a shift factor was employed to     manage the A/D conversion from 12 bits to 8 bits.  Proper auto     exposure for the front B&W cameras generally required a shift     factor of 2, while the aft color camera used a shift factor of 1.       Compression:       Used optionally on front camera B&W images only, the block     truncation coding (BTC) algorithm gave a fixed 4.9:1 compression     ratio, helping to reduce the communication time without unduly     sacrificing image quality.  In pre-flight tests, a S/N ratio of     145:1 was achieved.  Compression was performed on 16 column by 4     row blocks of image data.  When the BTC compression was performed     on aft camera images, a loss of color information resulted.       Calibration   ===========     The overall approach to acquiring camera calibration data for the     rover was to capture images of a calibration target placed at two     distinct but known locations in front of the camera.  The     calibration target was rigid with a known geometry, and consisted     of a flat black square with a 17 x 17 array of white circles with     known separation machined into its surface, mounted to a     structural framework.  The rover was placed on a stable platform     and oriented so that the forward cameras faced the calibration     fixture, with the fixture near the center of the camera field of     view.  A theodolite system measured the precise location of the     rover and the four corners of the target.  The target was imaged     by the forward rover camera.  The target was then moved backward     approximately one meter, but still located near the center of the     cameras' field of view.  The location of the target was again     determined by the theodolite system, and the target was again     imaged.  The entire process was repeated with the rear rover     camera facing toward the target.       The data collected for the rover was then processed using a set     of programs, collectively referred to as CCAL, to produce the     CAHV camera models for each rover camera.  A description of the     CCAL software follows.       CCAL       These programs have been written for calibrating cameras for use     in robotic machine vision.  The programs were developed in the     Robotics Vehicles Group (known by other names in years past) of     Section 345 (formerly 347) at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.  The     camera models are based on the linear models of Yakimovsky and     Cunningham, were extended to include radial lens distortion by     Gennery, and were further extended to include fish-eye lenses by     Xiong and Gennery.  The calibration measurement and reduction     algorithms were designed by Gennery.  For more information on the     camera models, see the references below.       There are a number of programs for performing camera calibration.     All of them assume that the cameras are mounted and/or aligned as     needed prior to calibration, and that the user has some method of     obtaining calibration images from the cameras stored into files.     The file format used is a local format call PIC.  This format is     very simple.  The first four bytes of the file are the integer     number of rows in the image.  The next four bytes are the integer     number of columns in the image.  Following these are the byte     pixels in normal scan line order.  While the nominal storage of     the 4-byte integers is big-endian on all current systems (MSB     first, LSB last), the software will recognize little-endian     integers as well.       Most of the CCAL programs display graphical data by using the X     windowing system, and therefore must be run under an X-based     graphical user interface (GUI).         Calibration Overview     --------------------       Camera calibration is broken into two major stages.  The first       is the collection of calibration data; the second is the       reduction of those data to form camera models.         The calibration data is a collection of 3D-to-2D correspondence       points.  For each of a number of locations within the field of       view of the camera, it is necessary to determine both its 3D       world coordinate, and where it falls in the 2D image plane.       The 3D locations of points must be non-coplanar in order to be       able to solve for the camera-model parameters.         Two programs are provided to collect calibration data.  One       lets the user indicate with a mouse click where each of 2D       points falls.  The other does analysis of images showing a       special calibration fixture in known locations.  The output of       both of these programs is a data file containing the 3D-to-2D       correspondence data.         The next step involves using another program to reduce the       data.  Other programs may then be used to examine the resulting       camera models.         Programs     --------       The following is a brief overview of the calibration programs:         Ccal5d is used to make a manual collection of calibration data.       The user inputs 3D coordinates either interactively or from a       file and then specifies with a mouse click where in a displayed       image the corresponding 2D images points are located.         Ccaldots is used to analyze images of a special calibration       fixture in known locations.  With minimal operator       initialization this program will determine 2D locations to       sub-pixel accuracy and match them up to the a priori 3D       locations.         Ccaladj performs a least-squares fit of the calibration data to       the parameters of the camera models.  It outputs the model       parameters along with covariance data.  It can produce the old       linear perspective CAHV camera models, the newer CAHVOR models       that include terms for radial lens distortion, or the most       recent CAHVORE models that include a moving entrance pupil.       Both perspective and fish-eye lenses are handled in CAHVORE.         Ccalres graphically displays the residuals of the calibration       by examining the input data and comparing the input 2D       locations to the 2D locations computed with the camera model.       The user can scale the residuals for easy viewing.         Ccaldist displays the amount of distortion in a CAHVOR camera       model.  It can render the display in a graphical form and in a       textual/numeric form.  In the case of the numeric form, the       user is prompted for 2D image locations at which distortion       information is wanted.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:mpfr.rcrr,ROVER CAMERA REAR for MPFR,ROVER CAMERA REAR,"     Instrument Overview   ===================     The rover, named 'Sojourner', was essential to the achievement of     the major scientific goals of the Pathfinder mission because it     carried the Alpha Proton X-ray Spectrometer, or APXS, that     analyzed rocks and other surface materials.  Aside from     transporting the APXS, the rover also contributed scientifically     by carrying three cameras that yielded a large quantity of image     data.  The discussion of the rover 'instrument' per se in this     section will focus on the salient characteristics of the three     cameras, and not of the APXS.  For a complete discussion of the     latter, see the instrument description for the APXS.       Two front monochromatic camera/laser systems provided stereo     viewing and ranging, while the rear mounted camera was     discriminant in the red, green, and IR spectral bandwidths to     produce color images.  Whereas the Imager for Mars Pathfinder     (IMP) camera viewed the Martian scenes from a fixed platform at     spatial resolutions that diminished with distance, the mobile     rover was able to drive up to landforms, including those hidden     from the IMP, to image them at higher resolution.       The rover cameras were built by the Microrover Flight Experiment     Team at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.       Scientific Objectives   =====================     The rover's Primary Mission was planned for seven sols (Martian     days).  The rover was designed to interact with slightly more     than 300 square meters of Martian terrain, though initial     operations were conducted within a limit of 10 meters or less of     the lander.       Primary objectives for the rover were 1) exit the lander as early     as practical on the basis of lander stereoscopic images, 2) send     initial vehicle performance and technology experiment data to the     lander, 3) move a few meters and repeat objective #2, 4) acquire     and transmit images showing the condition of the lander, 5)     acquire images at the end of daily traverses for navigation     purposes, or encounter, acquire, and transmit an image of a rock     or soil patch for subsequent APXS analysis, 6) deploy APXS on the     imaged rock or soil patch, if possible, for 1 to 10 hours     duration for chemical analysis, 7) query the APXS for final data     and transmit interim and final data to the lander, and 8)     traverse diverse terrains and repeat objective #2.       An Extended Mission of 30 sols was planned and more than     realized, as the governing spacecraft, rover and site-related     factors permitted rover activities to continue for 81 sols.     Extended Mission objectives were similar to the Primary     objectives, with technology experiments amended to explore the     diverse terrains further away from the lander.       As during the Primary Mission, Extended operations of the rover     cameras were to yield a high resolution image dataset critical     for navigation purposes and geologic analysis of structures in     rocks and soil-like materials.  The rover image data were to     contribute to the technology experiments by affording high     resolution stereoscopic and multispectral examination of 1)     features targeted for APXS chemical analysis, 2) slumped or     eroded surface material that had been excavated by the churning     rover wheels, 3) aeolian effects on the exposed, upturned     material, and 4) overturned rocks.  This would aid in achieving     the scientific objective of better understanding surface material     properties such as grain size, bulk density, friction angle,     cohesion, and compressibility, which could then be put in the     larger context of geologic features seen in the lander IMP     images.       Of the ten Technology Experiments, rover camera images were     acquired to support the following six: a) Terrain     Characterization, b) Basic Soil Mechanics, c) Wheel Abrasion, d)     Thermal Characterization, e) Dead Reckoning and Path     Reconstruction, and f) Vision Sensor Performance.  For a     description of these experiments, refer to [MATIJEVICETAL1997A].       Subsystems   ==========     There were three imaging subsystems aboard the rover.  Two     broad-band monochrome camera/laser systems were located on the     forward part of the rover, and a third camera was located on the     aft part near the APXS.  The two front cameras, used in     conjunction with laser stripe projectors for hazard detection,     provided images for stereoscopy and measurements.  The aft     camera, which was rotated 90 degrees, provided spectral     information while imaging the APXS target area, rover tracks, and     terrain.       The 'cameras' were CCDs clocked out by the rover Central     Processing Unit (CPU).  The camera systems were capable of     auto-exposure, block truncation coding (BTC) data compression,     bad pixel/column handling, and image data packetizing.       The major components of the camera systems are described in     detail below.       Detectors   =========     Front Camera Specifications:       CCD array size        : 484 (vertical) x 768 (horizontal) pixels     Pixel size            : 13.6 um (vertical) x 11.6 um (horizontal)     Full well             : 60,000 electrons                             (manufacturer claims 80,000)     Output sensitivity    : 10 uV/electron     Dynamic range         : > 60 dB     Dark Noise            : 40 electrons rms     Dark Current          : < 0.5 nA/cm**2     Blooming suppression  : > 300 X     Maximum Data Rate     : 14.3 MHz     Image lag             : negligible       Aft Camera Specifications:       Same as the Front Camera specs, except that the CCD chip was     engineered as a Color Filter Array.  The pixels were arranged in     a 'field-staggered 3G' color mosaic filter pattern.  In each 4x4     pixel block, 12 were Green sensitive, 2 were Red sensitive and 2     were Blue sensitive.  The blue pixels were sensitive to both blue     and infrared wavelengths.  Given that the camera optics blocked     out much of the light in the blue part of the spectrum, the     'blue' pixels were essentially infrared pixels.  (More     information about the aft, color CCD is available in     [DLUNA&FROSINI1992] and [PARULSKIETAL1992].) The pixel map for     the color CCD is as follows:                             G R G R                           G G G G                           B G B G                           G G G G       This map repeats in both the row and column directions.  This is     the orientation of the pixel map for a rotated image, and thus     will have to be rotated 90 degrees to match the color map     published by the manufacturer of the CCD (Eastman Kodak Company).       Optics   ======     Optical Material:       There were three elements that made up the optical subsystem: 1)     camera window, 2) objective lens, and 3) field flattener lens.     Their material makeup included optical grade sapphire and zinc     selenide.  This was significant in that the zinc selenide     effectively blocked transmittance of most Blue light.  For a     diagram of the optical elements, see document [SEPULVEDA1994].       Camera window        : Optical grade sapphire     Objective lens       : Optical grade zinc selenide     Field Flattener lens : Optical grade zinc selenide       General Camera Features:       The resolving power of the rover cameras contributed     significantly to the technology experiments measuring grain sizes     in surface material.  The rover cameras were designed to be able     to resolve fragments about 0.6 to 1.0 cm across at a nominal     range of 0.65 m.  Closer viewing of the surface near the wheels     could reduce these sizes by four-tenths, and special situations     (ie., close-up views of a rock 20 cm high) could reduce these     values by as much as one-tenth.       Lens focal length                : 4 mm     Forward camera separation        : 12.56 cm     Approximate height above surface : 26 cm       Fields of View:       Forward cross track     : 127.5 deg     Forward along track     : 94.5 deg     Aft cross track         : 94.5 deg     Aft along track         : 127.5 deg     Forward Boresight Angle : -22.5 deg     Aft Boresight Angle     : -41.4 deg       Average Spatial Resolution per Pixel:       Spatial resolution is the product of the distance of an object or     surface from the camera and the camera resolution (in     mrad/pixel).  To calculate the average spatial resolutions, a     camera resolution of 0.003153 mrad/pixel was used.       Forward cross track : 0.166 deg (2.897 mrad)     Forward along track : 0.195 deg (3.409 mrad)     Aft cross track     : 0.195 deg (3.409 mrad)     Aft along track     : 0.166 deg (2.897 mrad)       Filters   =======     The zinc selenide material contained in the camera fore optics     (see Optical Material above) served to filter out most light     transmitted in the Blue region below 500 nm.  This effect applied     to all cameras.       The filter on the front cameras was to have a peak transmittance     of 97% at the central wavelength, which is defined as W = 860 nm     +30 nm / -30 nm.       For every 4x4 block of pixels in the aft Color Filter Array, 12     were green, two were red, and two were infrared, allowing     multispectral imaging of surface materials.  Compared to the     response for the red and green pixels, that of the infrared     pixels was low.  When exposure time was increased to improve the     dynamic range of the infrared pixels, the impact was negative as     light bled from the red and green pixels into the infrared     pixels.  As a result, the aft color camera was most useful in     providing red and green color information.  For a schematic     diagram showing the relative spectral responses of the aft color     camera, see Figure 5 in the [MATIJEVICETAL1997A].       Forward Wavelength Sensitivity : 830 - 890 nm     Aft Wavelength Sensitivity     : 500 - 900 nm       Operational Modes   =================     Many optional command parameters are available to control the     exposure and processing.  These include everything from exposure     time to the amount and type of data compression.  All of this     information is attached to the image headers.       Laser ranging:       Proximity scanning using the lasers was controlled by a table of     camera/laser combinations.  For each combination, a list of     calibrated scan lines was stored.  For each laser at each line,     the nominal spot position, first-order scaling of pixel offset to     height, and correction scale factors for pitch and roll were     stored.       Image capture:       Image capture was executed by applying low-level functions to     manage the acquisition, readout, and optionally, compression of     the data.  Valid image data were in rows 6 through 489 and     columns 0 through 767; row 490 contained dark reference pixels.     The data was packetized for telemetry, with enclosed identifiers     describing the exposure (in milliseconds) and image region.       Auto exposure determination was indicated by an exposure time of     zero.  Given an image region, an overexposed image was taken and     the brightest (saturated) pixel found.  Then a geometric search     of exposure times was performed, until an image was found with an     average pixel value between 40% and 50% of saturation.  Finally,     exposure time was reduced by 25% as many times as necessary until     no more than 1% of the pixels were within 5% of saturation.  An     exposure time of 1 indicated that the last computed auto exposure     time was re-used.  If no auto exposure had been performed since     the last wakeup, a new auto exposure time was determined.       As part of the auto exposure, a shift factor was employed to     manage the A/D conversion from 12 bits to 8 bits.  Proper auto     exposure for the front B&W cameras generally required a shift     factor of 2, while the aft color camera used a shift factor of 1.       Compression:       Used optionally on front camera B&W images only, the block     truncation coding (BTC) algorithm gave a fixed 4.9:1 compression     ratio, helping to reduce the communication time without unduly     sacrificing image quality.  In pre-flight tests, a S/N ratio of     145:1 was achieved.  Compression was performed on 16 column by 4     row blocks of image data.  When the BTC compression was performed     on aft camera images, a loss of color information resulted.       Calibration   ===========     The overall approach to acquiring camera calibration data for the     rover was to capture images of a calibration target placed at two     distinct but known locations in front of the camera.  The     calibration target was rigid with a known geometry, and consisted     of a flat black square with a 17 x 17 array of white circles with     known separation machined into its surface, mounted to a     structural framework.  The rover was placed on a stable platform     and oriented so that the forward cameras faced the calibration     fixture, with the fixture near the center of the camera field of     view.  A theodolite system measured the precise location of the     rover and the four corners of the target.  The target was imaged     by the forward rover camera.  The target was then moved backward     approximately one meter, but still located near the center of the     cameras' field of view.  The location of the target was again     determined by the theodolite system, and the target was again     imaged.  The entire process was repeated with the rear rover     camera facing toward the target.       The data collected for the rover was then processed using a set     of programs, collectively referred to as CCAL, to produce the     CAHV camera models for each rover camera.  A description of the     CCAL software follows.       CCAL       These programs have been written for calibrating cameras for use     in robotic machine vision.  The programs were developed in the     Robotics Vehicles Group (known by other names in years past) of     Section 345 (formerly 347) at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.  The     camera models are based on the linear models of Yakimovsky and     Cunningham, were extended to include radial lens distortion by     Gennery, and were further extended to include fish-eye lenses by     Xiong and Gennery.  The calibration measurement and reduction     algorithms were designed by Gennery.  For more information on the     camera models, see the references below.       There are a number of programs for performing camera calibration.     All of them assume that the cameras are mounted and/or aligned as     needed prior to calibration, and that the user has some method of     obtaining calibration images from the cameras stored into files.     The file format used is a local format call PIC.  This format is     very simple.  The first four bytes of the file are the integer     number of rows in the image.  The next four bytes are the integer     number of columns in the image.  Following these are the byte     pixels in normal scan line order.  While the nominal storage of     the 4-byte integers is big-endian on all current systems (MSB     first, LSB last), the software will recognize little-endian     integers as well.       Most of the CCAL programs display graphical data by using the X     windowing system, and therefore must be run under an X-based     graphical user interface (GUI).         Calibration Overview     --------------------       Camera calibration is broken into two major stages.  The first       is the collection of calibration data; the second is the       reduction of those data to form camera models.         The calibration data is a collection of 3D-to-2D correspondence       points.  For each of a number of locations within the field of       view of the camera, it is necessary to determine both its 3D       world coordinate, and where it falls in the 2D image plane.       The 3D locations of points must be non-coplanar in order to be       able to solve for the camera-model parameters.         Two programs are provided to collect calibration data.  One       lets the user indicate with a mouse click where each of 2D       points falls.  The other does analysis of images showing a       special calibration fixture in known locations.  The output of       both of these programs is a data file containing the 3D-to-2D       correspondence data.         The next step involves using another program to reduce the       data.  Other programs may then be used to examine the resulting       camera models.         Programs     --------       The following is a brief overview of the calibration programs:         Ccal5d is used to make a manual collection of calibration data.       The user inputs 3D coordinates either interactively or from a       file and then specifies with a mouse click where in a displayed       image the corresponding 2D images points are located.         Ccaldots is used to analyze images of a special calibration       fixture in known locations.  With minimal operator       initialization this program will determine 2D locations to       sub-pixel accuracy and match them up to the a priori 3D       locations.         Ccaladj performs a least-squares fit of the calibration data to       the parameters of the camera models.  It outputs the model       parameters along with covariance data.  It can produce the old       linear perspective CAHV camera models, the newer CAHVOR models       that include terms for radial lens distortion, or the most       recent CAHVORE models that include a moving entrance pupil.       Both perspective and fish-eye lenses are handled in CAHVORE.         Ccalres graphically displays the residuals of the calibration       by examining the input data and comparing the input 2D       locations to the 2D locations computed with the camera model.       The user can scale the residuals for easy viewing.         Ccaldist displays the amount of distortion in a CAHVOR camera       model.  It can render the display in a graphical form and in a       textual/numeric form.  In the case of the numeric form, the       user is prompted for 2D image locations at which distortion       information is wanted.

Two front monochromatic camera/laser systems provided stereo     viewing and ranging, while the rear mounted camera was     discriminant in the red, green, and IR spectral bandwidths to     produce color images.

Primary objectives for the rover were 1) exit the lander as early     as practical on the basis of lander stereoscopic images, 2) send     initial vehicle performance and technology experiment data to the     lander, 3) move a few meters and repeat objective #2, 4) acquire     and transmit images showing the condition of the lander, 5)     acquire images at the end of daily traverses for navigation     purposes, or encounter, acquire, and transmit an image of a rock     or soil patch for subsequent APXS analysis, 6) deploy APXS on the     imaged rock or soil patch, if possible, for 1 to 10 hours     duration for chemical analysis, 7) query the APXS for final data     and transmit interim and final data to the lander, and 8)     traverse diverse terrains and repeat objective #2.       An Extended Mission of 30 sols was planned and more than     realized, as the governing spacecraft, rover and site-related     factors permitted rover activities to continue for 81 sols.

Of the ten Technology Experiments, rover camera images were     acquired to support the following six: a) Terrain     Characterization, b) Basic Soil Mechanics, c) Wheel Abrasion, d)     Thermal Characterization, e) Dead Reckoning and Path     Reconstruction, and f) Vision Sensor Performance.  For a     description of these experiments, refer to [MATIJEVICETAL1997A].       Subsystems   ==========     There were three imaging subsystems aboard the rover.  Two     broad-band monochrome camera/laser systems were located on the     forward part of the rover, and a third camera was located on the     aft part near the APXS.  The two front cameras, used in     conjunction with laser stripe projectors for hazard detection,     provided images for stereoscopy and measurements.  The aft     camera, which was rotated 90 degrees, provided spectral     information while imaging the APXS target area, rover tracks, and     terrain.       The 'cameras' were CCDs clocked out by the rover Central     Processing Unit (CPU).  The camera systems were capable of     auto-exposure, block truncation coding (BTC) data compression,     bad pixel/column handling, and image data packetizing.       The major components of the camera systems are described in     detail below.

The pixels were arranged in     a 'field-staggered 3G' color mosaic filter pattern.  In each 4x4     pixel block, 12 were Green sensitive, 2 were Red sensitive and 2     were Blue sensitive.  The blue pixels were sensitive to both blue     and infrared wavelengths.  Given that the camera optics blocked     out much of the light in the blue part of the spectrum, the     'blue' pixels were essentially infrared pixels.  (More     information about the aft, color CCD is available in     [DLUNA&FROSINI1992] and [PARULSKIETAL1992].) The pixel map for     the color CCD is as follows:                             G R G R                           G G G G                           B G B G                           G G G G       This map repeats in both the row and column directions.  This is     the orientation of the pixel map for a rotated image, and thus     will have to be rotated 90 degrees to match the color map     published by the manufacturer of the CCD (Eastman Kodak Company).       Optics   ======     Optical Material:       There were three elements that made up the optical subsystem: 1)     camera window, 2) objective lens, and 3) field flattener lens.     Their material makeup included optical grade sapphire and zinc     selenide.  This was significant in that the zinc selenide     effectively blocked transmittance of most Blue light.  For a     diagram of the optical elements, see document [SEPULVEDA1994].       Camera window        : Optical grade sapphire     Objective lens       : Optical grade zinc selenide     Field Flattener lens : Optical grade zinc selenide       General Camera Features:       The resolving power of the rover cameras contributed     significantly to the technology experiments measuring grain sizes     in surface material.  The rover cameras were designed to be able     to resolve fragments about 0.6 to 1.0 cm across at a nominal     range of 0.65 m.  Closer viewing of the surface near the wheels     could reduce these sizes by four-tenths, and special situations     (ie., close-up views of a rock 20 cm high) could reduce these     values by as much as one-tenth.

To calculate the average spatial resolutions, a     camera resolution of 0.003153 mrad/pixel was used.

This effect applied     to all cameras.       The filter on the front cameras was to have a peak transmittance     of 97% at the central wavelength, which is defined as W = 860 nm     +30 nm / -30 nm.       For every 4x4 block of pixels in the aft Color Filter Array, 12     were green, two were red, and two were infrared, allowing     multispectral imaging of surface materials.  Compared to the     response for the red and green pixels, that of the infrared     pixels was low.  When exposure time was increased to improve the     dynamic range of the infrared pixels, the impact was negative as     light bled from the red and green pixels into the infrared     pixels.  As a result, the aft color camera was most useful in     providing red and green color information.  For a schematic     diagram showing the relative spectral responses of the aft color     camera, see Figure 5 in the [MATIJEVICETAL1997A].       Forward Wavelength Sensitivity : 830 - 890 nm     Aft Wavelength Sensitivity     : 500 - 900 nm       Operational Modes   =================     Many optional command parameters are available to control the     exposure and processing.  These include everything from exposure     time to the amount and type of data compression.  All of this     information is attached to the image headers.       Laser ranging:       Proximity scanning using the lasers was controlled by a table of     camera/laser combinations.  For each combination, a list of     calibrated scan lines was stored.  For each laser at each line,     the nominal spot position, first-order scaling of pixel offset to     height, and correction scale factors for pitch and roll were     stored.       Image capture:       Image capture was executed by applying low-level functions to     manage the acquisition, readout, and optionally, compression of     the data.  Valid image data were in rows 6 through 489 and     columns 0 through 767; row 490 contained dark reference pixels.     The data was packetized for telemetry, with enclosed identifiers     describing the exposure (in milliseconds) and image region.       Auto exposure determination was indicated by an exposure time of     zero.  Given an image region, an overexposed image was taken and     the brightest (saturated) pixel found.  Then a geometric search     of exposure times was performed, until an image was found with an     average pixel value between 40% and 50% of saturation.  Finally,     exposure time was reduced by 25% as many times as necessary until     no more than 1% of the pixels were within 5% of saturation.  An     exposure time of 1 indicated that the last computed auto exposure     time was re-used.  If no auto exposure had been performed since     the last wakeup, a new auto exposure time was determined.       As part of the auto exposure, a shift factor was employed to     manage the A/D conversion from 12 bits to 8 bits.  Proper auto     exposure for the front B&W cameras generally required a shift     factor of 2, while the aft color camera used a shift factor of 1.       Compression:       Used optionally on front camera B&W images only, the block     truncation coding (BTC) algorithm gave a fixed 4.9:1 compression     ratio, helping to reduce the communication time without unduly     sacrificing image quality.  In pre-flight tests, a S/N ratio of     145:1 was achieved.  Compression was performed on 16 column by 4     row blocks of image data.  When the BTC compression was performed     on aft camera images, a loss of color information resulted.       Calibration   ===========     The overall approach to acquiring camera calibration data for the     rover was to capture images of a calibration target placed at two     distinct but known locations in front of the camera.  The     calibration target was rigid with a known geometry, and consisted     of a flat black square with a 17 x 17 array of white circles with     known separation machined into its surface, mounted to a     structural framework.  The rover was placed on a stable platform     and oriented so that the forward cameras faced the calibration     fixture, with the fixture near the center of the camera field of     view.  A theodolite system measured the precise location of the     rover and the four corners of the target.  The target was imaged     by the forward rover camera.  The target was then moved backward     approximately one meter, but still located near the center of the     cameras' field of view.  The location of the target was again     determined by the theodolite system, and the target was again     imaged.  The entire process was repeated with the rear rover     camera facing toward the target.       The data collected for the rover was then processed using a set     of programs, collectively referred to as CCAL, to produce the     CAHV camera models for each rover camera.  A description of the     CCAL software follows.       CCAL       These programs have been written for calibrating cameras for use     in robotic machine vision.  The programs were developed in the     Robotics Vehicles Group (known by other names in years past) of     Section 345 (formerly 347) at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.  The     camera models are based on the linear models of Yakimovsky and     Cunningham, were extended to include radial lens distortion by     Gennery, and were further extended to include fish-eye lenses by     Xiong and Gennery.  The calibration measurement and reduction     algorithms were designed by Gennery.  For more information on the     camera models, see the references below.       There are a number of programs for performing camera calibration.     All of them assume that the cameras are mounted and/or aligned as     needed prior to calibration, and that the user has some method of     obtaining calibration images from the cameras stored into files.     The file format used is a local format call PIC.  This format is     very simple.  The first four bytes of the file are the integer     number of rows in the image.  The next four bytes are the integer     number of columns in the image.  Following these are the byte     pixels in normal scan line order.  While the nominal storage of     the 4-byte integers is big-endian on all current systems (MSB     first, LSB last), the software will recognize little-endian     integers as well.       Most of the CCAL programs display graphical data by using the X     windowing system, and therefore must be run under an X-based     graphical user interface (GUI).         Calibration Overview     --------------------       Camera calibration is broken into two major stages.  The first       is the collection of calibration data; the second is the       reduction of those data to form camera models.         The calibration data is a collection of 3D-to-2D correspondence       points.  For each of a number of locations within the field of       view of the camera, it is necessary to determine both its 3D       world coordinate, and where it falls in the 2D image plane.       The 3D locations of points must be non-coplanar in order to be       able to solve for the camera-model parameters.         Two programs are provided to collect calibration data.  One       lets the user indicate with a mouse click where each of 2D       points falls.  The other does analysis of images showing a       special calibration fixture in known locations.  The output of       both of these programs is a data file containing the 3D-to-2D       correspondence data.         The next step involves using another program to reduce the       data.  Other programs may then be used to examine the resulting       camera models.         Programs     --------       The following is a brief overview of the calibration programs:         Ccal5d is used to make a manual collection of calibration data.       The user inputs 3D coordinates either interactively or from a       file and then specifies with a mouse click where in a displayed       image the corresponding 2D images points are located.         Ccaldots is used to analyze images of a special calibration       fixture in known locations.  With minimal operator       initialization this program will determine 2D locations to       sub-pixel accuracy and match them up to the a priori 3D       locations.         Ccaladj performs a least-squares fit of the calibration data to       the parameters of the camera models.  It outputs the model       parameters along with covariance data.  It can produce the old       linear perspective CAHV camera models, the newer CAHVOR models       that include terms for radial lens distortion, or the most       recent CAHVORE models that include a moving entrance pupil.       Both perspective and fish-eye lenses are handled in CAHVORE.         Ccalres graphically displays the residuals of the calibration       by examining the input data and comparing the input 2D       locations to the 2D locations computed with the camera model.       The user can scale the residuals for easy viewing.         Ccaldist displays the amount of distortion in a CAHVOR camera       model.  It can render the display in a graphical form and in a       textual/numeric form.  In the case of the numeric form, the       user is prompted for 2D image locations at which distortion       information is wanted.

The instrument measures 2 m x 2 m x 2m and weighs 2 t. COMICS operates             in the wavelength range 7.5 - 25 µm and is optimized for use in the N-band (7.5 - 13.5 µm) and Q-             band (16 - 25 µm). The detectors used are 6 320-pixel by 240-pixel Si:As BIB detectors: 1 for              imaging/slit viewing (40"" slit length) and 5 arrays for spectroscopy, which provide high sensitivity,             high spatial resolution, and observational efficiency. The field of view (FOV) is 42 arcsec x 32 arcsec             for imaging, with a pixel size of 50 µm. Pixel scale is 0.13 arcsec (imaging) or 0.165 arcsec             (spectroscopy), which translates into specrtral resolution of 250-10,000 in N-band and 2,500 in Q-band.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:ns.mess,Neutron Spectrometer for MESSENGER,Neutron Spectrometer,"The Neutron Spectrometer (NS) instrument formed part of the geochemistry investigation of the MESSENGER mission and yielded information about the elemental composition of the planet's surface. NS measured the flux of ejected neutrons in three energy ranges and was particularly sensitive to the H content of a body. Neutron measurements were used to infer the composition of Mercury's surface over localized regions using established techniques, such as used recently on the Lunar Prospector and Mars Odyssey missions. The NS sensor consisted of three scintillators, each wrapped separately and coupled to separate photo-multiplier tubes. The three scintillators were sensitive to neutrons of different energies: thermal neutrons (0.025 - 1 eV), epithermal neutrons (1 eV - 500 keV), and fast neutrons (500 keV - 7 MeV). The first and third scintillators were lithium (6Li)-glass scintillators (LG1 and LG2) that respond to a combination of thermal and epithermal neutrons. The middle scintillator was a borated plastic (BP) scintillator that responded only to epithermal and fast neutrons due to its electronics setup. The interaction of galactic cosmic rays (GCR) with the surface of Mercury produces neutrons, some of which escape the surface and produce a neutron signal that can be measured by the orbiting NS sensor. The measured neutron energy spectrum reflects the transport properties of the surface composition and is sensitive to depths down to about 1 m. Thermal neutrons are sensitive to a variety of elements, including Fe, Ti, Gd, Sm, Cl, and C. Epithermal neutrons are mostly sensitive to H abundance. Fast neutrons can provide a good measure of average atomic mass. For the MESSENGER mission, the NS sensor mapped the abundance of H over most of the northern hemisphere of Mercury, providing significant new information regarding the potential presence of water ice within and near permanently shaded craters near the north pole.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:ody.accel,ACCELEROMETER for ODY,ACCELEROMETER,"       Instrument Overview     ===================       During aerobraking, the accelerometers measure the change in velocity of       the spacecraft due to aerodynamic forces. The dominant force is along the       spacecraft y-direction. The spacecraft y-axis is approximately into the       wind. Data are provided at 1 second intervals and recorded in units of       m/s^2.         Scientific Objectives     =====================       Accelerometer data were used to characterize the nature of the atmosphere,       to determine the effect of the atmosphere on each orbit, and to predict       the effect of the atmosphere on future orbits.         Calibration     ===========       The instrument was calibrated on each orbit to determine drift in       instrument bias.  Bias is determined by monitoring the accelerometer       instrument during periods of inactivity before and after entering the       atmosphere. The bias acceleration is then estimated over the entire pass       by trending the data from the pre- and post-atmospheric entry periods.       The pre- and post-atmospheric periods were defined by instrument turn-on       and turn-off times and a lower limit on the altitude of data used for       calibration, typically 250 km.         Operational Considerations     ==========================       The instrument readings are affected by changes in temperature.  The       instrument is mounted in the inertial measurement unit (IMU) and the       temperature of the IMU is by temperature sensors.         Operational Modes     =================       The data from the accelerometer are passed to the telemetry deck during an       aerobraking pass from the time the s/c reaches aerobraking orientation       until the s/c returns to nominal orbit attitude.         Measured Parameters     ===================       An accelerometer is an instrument that measures the acceleration of the       case of the sensor due to external forces.  All accelerometers have a       'proof mass' and it is the tendency of the proof mass to move relative to       the case that is a measure of the acceleration of the case.  Early       accelerometers produced output that was directly related to acceleration;       but modern sensors integrate the internally measured signal to reduce       noise and the output is proportional to the change in velocity over the       integration time.  In high precision accelerometers, like those on ODY,       the proof mass is an electronically floating mass.  The electromagnetic       field is varied to keep the proof mass stationary relative to the case.       The current required to accomplish this is proportional to the       acceleration. The accelerometers on ODY are sensitive to acceleration of       the center of mass (c.m.) of the s/c, pseudo-accelerations (i.e.       centrifugal) due to rigid motion of the s/c about the c.m., and       differences in gravitational force at the proof mass and the c.m. of the       s/c (gravity gradient).

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:ody.mar,MARS RADIATION ENVIRONMENT EXPERIMENT for ODY,MARS RADIATION ENVIRONMENT EXPERIMENT,"         Scientific Objectives and Overview   ==================================     Mars is substantially exposed to the harshest elements of space     weather. Unlike Earth, which sits inside a protective magnetic field     called the magnetosphere, Mars does not have a global magnetic field     to shield it from solar flares and cosmic rays. Another factor is     the lack of atmosphere. Mars' atmosphere is less than 1% as thick as     Earth. These two factors make Mars vulnerable to space radiation.     The Marie instrument was designed to measure the amount of harmful     radiation in the Mars environment.       The particles which are thought to be most harmful to humans fall     mostly in the energy range of 30 MeV to thousands of MeV per     nucleon.  These are the particles with enough energy to damage human     DNA. The MARIE instrument is designed to measure particles in the     range of 15 MeV to 500 MeV/n. The data gathered in several detector     elements is combined to identify the species of the incident     particles and their energies in this range. The MARIE Instrument was     developed by NASA Johnson Space Center. The development process was     a coordinated effort of NASA/JSC, Lockheed-Martin and Battelle.     Battelle developed the CPU, power boards, A detector, B detector and     C detector boards.  Lockheed was tasked with development of the     position sensor devices (PSD), the instrument packaging, system     integration, software development and certifying the instrument for     flight. NASA/JSC provided the project management and coordination of     the contractors.       If a particle enters the MARIE detector telescope within the 60     degree cone defined by the A1 and A2 detectors, and has enough     energy to reach the A2 detector, it is considered a coincident     event. On coincident events, all detector boards are polled by the     CPU and the data for this event is recorded. The readout for each     detector records a pulse height that is proportional to the amount     of energy deposited in the detector. The PSD's also record the     position of the strike within the detector.       The minimum proton energy required to form an A1A2 coincidence     corresponds to a proton with range greater than the sum of the     thickness of A1, PSD1, PSD2, and a minuscule part of the A2     thickness. This adds up to 0.374 g/cm2 of Si and corresponds to a     proton energy of 19.8 MeV. So protons above this energy will be     recorded by the telescope; more energy per nucleon is required for     higher-charged particles. If one takes into account the thin     aluminum case that surrounds MARIE, the minimum proton energy is 30     MeV.  The angular response functions are calculated for those     particles that give an A1A2 coincidence and also pass through PSD1     and PSD2 detectors, since they are the only particles that can     provide the incidence angle of the charged particle. Note that not     all particles that give rise to A1A2 coincidence pass through PSD1     and PSD2 because the position sensitive detector are slightly     smaller in size. A new particle identification algorithm is being     developed to determine incident angles for particles that miss the     PSDs or have their positions mis-reported by the PSDs. (The latter     are common, owing to spurious detector noise.)       If a particle hits only one of the A-detectors, the event is     discarded because the angle of impact and energy loss in the other     detector boards is not known. Also, any particle entering the bottom     of the telescope will not register an event on the C-detector due to     the directional properties of the C-detector.       The chassis box of MARIE is made from machined aluminum with an     alodine coating. The exterior surfaces are painted white. Input     voltage to MARIE is 28 VDC and power requirements are 3 watts for     survival mode and 7 watts for nominal operation.There are no     external controls. All control is from the orbiter through an RS-422     interface.       Calibration   ===========     Data obtained during the cruise phase of the 2001 Mars Odyssey     mission have been used to calibrate the data. Pulse height spectra     in the range 0 to 4096 have been scaled to yield distributions of     apparent charge, Z. Calibration factors for each detector were     determined by forcing the obvious high-energy proton peak in each     distribution to have its center at Z = 1.       Operational Considerations   ==========================     During Odyssey's daily DSN session, MARIE is off for 1-2 hours,     causing small gaps in coverage. When the recorded data volume     approaches the capacity of MARIE's local storage, data acquisition     is halted until the next download opportunity. When all data have     been downloaded, the storage area is erased and the instrument     reset. This sequence of events causes relatively long outages, on     the order of 1 to 2 days.       Detectors   =========     Each of the two A detector assemblies contains a 25.4 x 25.4 x 1 mm     ion-implanted silicon solid state detector, detector signal     amplifiers, detector high voltage supply and the interface circuitry     between the detector and the MARIE CPU. The MARIE CPU controls the     interface circuitry including high voltage control, collecting     digitized signal amplitude data and controlling signal coincidence     timing sources. The two A-detectors are used to define a coincidence     event. These detectors are operated near 160 V.       Each of the four B-detector assemblies contains a 5 mm thick     lithium-drifted silicon solid state detector, detector signal     amplifiers, detector high voltage supply and the interface circuitry     between the detector and the MARIE CPU. The MARIE CPU controls the     interface circuitry including high voltage control and collecting     digitized signal amplitude data. These detectors are operated near     350 V.       The C detector consists of a Schott-glass Cherenkov detector and a     Hamamatsu photo multiplier tube (PMT). When a charged particle with     a velocity greater than [velocity of light / glass refractive index]     hits the Cherenkov detector, the detector releases a photon light     burst proportional to the energy of the particle which struck it.     The photo multiplier tube receives the light pulse and translates it     into an electronic pulse which is amplified by the tube and read by     the electronics on the C-detector board. The C-detector assembly     contains the PMT, detector signal amplifiers, detector high voltage     supply and the interface circuitry between the detector and the     MARIE CPU. The MARIE CPU controls the interface circuitry including     high voltage control and collecting digitized signal amplitude data.       Each of the two position sensitive detector (PSD) assemblies     contains 25.4 X 25.4 mm position sensitive detector. These are     double-sided silicon strip detectors with 24 strips on each side,     with a 1 mm pitch. The strips on one side are oriented so as to be     orthogonal to the strips on the other side. The active area of these     detectors is 24 mm x 24 mm. Hits from all four strip planes define     the particle's incident angle.       From the front of the device, particles entering the detector pass     through detector A1, PSD1, PSD2, A2, B1, B2, B3, B4, and C.     Depending on the angle of incidence and scattering within the     detector, some of the downstream detectors (B's and C) may be missed     on any given event.       Electronics   ===========     The Central Processing Unit (CPU) board has an Intel 80C188     microprocessor, detector interface circuitry and data communication     hardware for transferring data to the spacecraft from the 80 MB     flash memory. The flash memory holds the program code and any data     which has not been transferred to the spacecraft. The power from the     spacecraft is nominally 28 volts. The Marie instrument has     Interpoint DC-DC converters to convert the power to a usable level.       Each detector has its own card, with all of the electronics     associated with the detector on it, including a 12 bit     analog-to-digital (ADC) converter, and Field Programmable Gate     Array (FPGA)       The power, mode control and data download of the MARIE instrument     are controlled by the Odyssey spacecraft. Commands are sent from the     ground to the spacecraft central processing unit (CPU) to power on     MARIE and to change modes.

The MARIE FOV (field of view), as defined in [2], is a 68-degree     cone centered around the -Y axis of the MARIE instrument frame.

The following data for the FOV geometry were extracted from the     SPICE instrument kernel for MARIE, provided by the NAIF Node of     the Planetary Data System [3].  (The text of this section also was     adapted from that SPICE kernel.)  These data are included here for     the benefit of those familiar with the use of SPICE kernels.

Science Mode: When placed in Science mode, the MARIE acts as an        autonomous data acquisition device. Data is collected until the        spacecraft issues a mode change command to move to survival mode.       Survival Mode: From survival mode, the spacecraft can issue commands        to download data, change parameters, power down or return to        Science Mode. During the data download, the spacecraft controls        the download process and downlinks the data to the ground.       Measured Parameters   ===================     The detector is composed primarily of three types of silicon     detectors: the A detectors, which are square in cross-section (25.4     mm on a side) and 1 mm in depth; the B detectors, circular, 63.5 mm     diameter and 5 mm thick; and the PSDs, or position-sensitive     detectors. The PSDs are square double-sided strip detectors with 24     1 mm strips on each side (the strips on one side are orthogonal to     those on the other side), and have a thickness of 0.3 mm. There are     two A detectors, A1 and A2; sandwiched in between them are PSD1 and     PSD2; behind A2, there are the B detectors, B1 through B4.     Downstream of B4 is a circular piece of quartz, 10 mm thick, that     radiates photons (Cerenkov radiation) generated by the passage of     high-velocity particles through it. The photons are reflected by a     45 deg mirror into a photo multiplier tube that sits out of the path     of particles that hit the detectors.       MARIE is triggered by a coincidence of hits in detectors A1 and     A2. Once triggered, the data acquisition system records 12-bit     digitized outputs which are proportional to the energies deposited     in the A and B detectors. A two-byte data word is stored for each of     these channels. The pulse height from the phototube is similarly     digitized in 12 bits and stored.       Readout of the PSDs is more complex. Each PSD has two orthogonal     sides, referred to as columns and rows. The following description     applies to each side of each detector. Onboard hardware analyzes the     signals from each of the 24 strips and finds the two largest pulse     heights. For each, the pulse height is digitized in 8 bits (256     channels) and stored, along with the strip number. The largest pulse     height and position are referred to as 'event1', the second-largest     as 'event2.' The event2 data are usually noise. Four quantities are     stored for each side of each detector, so that a total of sixteen     words (thirty-two bytes) of PSD data are stored on each event. The     eight-bit pulse heights are referred to as 'magnitudes', the     positions are valid only when in the range 1 to 24.       References   ==========     1.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:ody.rss,RADIO SCIENCE SUBSYSTEM for ODY,RADIO SCIENCE SUBSYSTEM,"           Instrument Overview     ===================       There were no recognized radio science investigations on       the 2001 Mars Odyssey (ODY) mission.  But investigators on       Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) requested access to ODY radio       tracking data.  To support them and future proposers to       Mars data analysis programs (MDAPs), the Planetary Data       System (PDS) accepted responsibility for archiving the ODY       data with initial activities funded jointly by MGS.         Radio science investigations utilize instrumentation with       elements both on a spacecraft and at ground stations -- in       this case, at the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN).  For ODY       much of this was equipment used for routine telecommunications.       The performance and calibration of both the spacecraft and       tracking stations directly affected the radio science data       accuracy, and they played a major role in determining the       quality of the results.  The spacecraft part of the radio       science instrument is described immediately below; that is       followed by a description of the DSN (ground) part of the       instrument.

Other components included one low-gain receive antenna (LGA);       one medium-gain transmit antenna (MGA); one steerable       high-gain antenna (HGA) for both transmitting (Tx) and receiving       (Rx); two redundant solid state power amplifiers (SSPAs); a       diplexer; several switches; and cabling.  The SDSTs were       connected to redundant Command and Data Handling (C&DH) units       in such a way that any pairing could be chosen.  A functional       block diagram is shown below.                                                       . . . . . . . .

The ODY telecommunications system was designed to perform the       following functions:           1) Receive an X-band uplink carrier from a DSN station and            demodulate the command data and ranging signal if either            were present;         2) Generate an X-band downlink carrier either by coherently            multiplying the frequency of the uplink carrier by the            turn-around ratio of 880/749 or by utilizing an            auxiliary crystal oscillator (AUX OSC);         3) Phase modulate the downlink carrier with either (or both)            of the following:             a composite telemetry signal, consisting of a square               wave subcarrier (25 kHz or 375 kHz) that was BPSK               (binary phase shift keying) modulated by telemetry data               provided by the C&DH subsystem;             the ranging signal that was demodulated from the uplink               (this is referred to as two-way, or turn-around,               ranging);         4) Permit control of the telecom subsystem through commands            to select signal routing and the operational mode of the            subsystem either from the ground or from command            sequences previously loaded on the spacecraft;         5) Provide telecom status for monitoring operating            conditions of the subsystem;         6) Provide ON/OFF power control for all RF transmitters;         7) Assume a single well-defined operating mode (a known            baseline state) after a Power-On-Reset (POR).         The X-band capability reduced plasma effects on radio       signals by a factor of 10 compared with older S-band       systems, but absence of a dual-frequency capability (both       S- and X-band) meant that plasma effects could not be       estimated and removed from radio data.         The spacecraft also carried redundant ultra-high frequency (UHF)       transceivers for communication and relay with future missions.       Since the UHF equipment was not used for radio science, it is       not described here.         Science Objectives     ==================       There were no radio science objectives for the 2001 Mars Odyssey       mission.  The radio tracking data could be used by others to       improve knowledge of the Mars gravity field .         Operational Considerations - Spacecraft     =======================================       Descriptions given here are for nominal performance.  The       spacecraft transponder system comprised redundant units,       each with slightly different characteristics.  As       transponder units age, their performance changes slightly.       More importantly, the performance for radio science depended       on operational factors such as the modulation state for the       transmitters, which cannot be predicted in advance.  The       performance also depended on factors which were not always       under the control of the 2001 Mars Odyssey Project.         The telecom subsystem relied on C&DH to control its operating       mode; that control could be done via real-time commands from       the ground or via a stored sequence onboard the spacecraft.       The only exception was the POR state, which would be entered       directly after a Power-On-Reset.         C&DH provided the data to be downlinked, it carried out the       frame and packet formatting and the Reed-Solomon encoding,       and it provided the clock to drive the encoding.  The clock was       either              data clock X 2 for (7,1/2) encoding or              data clock X 6 for (15,1/6) encoding       C&DH also handled error control for the uplink data stream.

After       aerobraking, the HGA was deployed and tracked the       Earth using a pair of gimbals (azimuth and elevation) at the       end of a boom.       The MGA was mounted on the HGA dish so that the MGA and HGA       boresights were equal.  The SSPAs were mounted behind the HGA       reflector to minimize circuit losses.         Investigators     =============       None.         Instrument Section / Operating Mode Descriptions - Spacecraft     =============================================================       Redundant components could be configured as desired.  Each       configuration had slightly different performance, but the       quantitative differences are unknown.         Instrument Overview - DSN     =========================       Three Deep Space Communications Complexes (DSCCs) (near       Barstow, CA; Canberra, Australia; and Madrid, Spain) comprise       the DSN tracking network.  Each complex is equipped with       several antennas [including at least one each 70-m, 34-m High       Efficiency (HEF), and 34-m Beam WaveGuide (BWG)], associated       electronics, and operational systems.  Primary activity       at each complex is radiation of commands to and reception of       telemetry data from active spacecraft.  Transmission and       reception is possible in several radio-frequency bands, the       most common being S-band (nominally a frequency of 2100-2300 MHz       or a wavelength of 14.2-13.0 cm) and X-band (7100-8500 MHz or       4.2-3.5 cm).  Transmitter output powers of up to 400 kW are       available.         Ground stations have the ability to transmit coded and uncoded       waveforms which can be echoed by distant spacecraft.  Analysis       of the received coding allows navigators to determine the       distance to the spacecraft; analysis of Doppler shift on the       carrier signal allows estimation of the line-of-sight       spacecraft velocity.  Range and Doppler measurements are used       to calculate the spacecraft trajectory and to infer gravity       fields of objects near the spacecraft.         Ground stations can record spacecraft signals that have       propagated through or been scattered from target media.       Measurements of signal parameters after wave interactions with       surfaces, atmospheres, rings, and plasmas are used to infer       physical and electrical properties of the target.         Principal investigators vary from experiment to experiment.       See the corresponding section of the spacecraft instrument       description or the data set description for specifics.         The Deep Space Network is managed by the Jet Propulsion       Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology for the       U.S.  National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

Subsystems - DSN     ================       The Deep Space Communications Complexes (DSCCs) are an integral       part of Radio Science instrumentation, along with the spacecraft       Radio Frequency Subsystem.  Their system performance directly       determines the degree of success of Radio Science       investigations, and their system calibration determines the       degree of accuracy in the results of the experiments.  The       following paragraphs describe the functions performed by the       individual subsystems of a DSCC.

Each DSCC includes a set of antennas, a Signal Processing       Center (SPC), and communication links to the Jet Propulsion       Laboratory (JPL).

The DMC is the center of activity at a DSCC.  The         DMC receives and archives most of the information from the         NOCC needed by the various DSCC subsystems during their         operation.  Control of most of the DSCC subsystems, as well         as the handling and displaying of any responses to control         directives and configuration and status information received         from each of the subsystems, is done through the DMC.  The         effect of this is to centralize the control, display, and         archiving functions necessary to operate a DSCC.         Communication among the various subsystems is done using a         Local Area Network (LAN) hooked up to each subsystem via a         network interface unit (NIU).           DSCC Antenna Mechanical Subsystem       ---------------------------------         Multi-mission Radio Science activities require support from         the 70-m, 34-m HEF, and 34-m BWG antenna subnets.  The         antennas at each DSCC function as large-aperture collectors         which, by double reflection, cause the incoming radio         frequency (RF) energy to enter the feed horns.  The large         collecting surface of the antenna focuses the incoming energy         onto a subreflector, which is adjustable in both axial and         angular position.  These adjustments are made to correct for         gravitational deformation of the antenna as it moves between         zenith and the horizon; the deformation can be as large as         5 cm.  The subreflector adjustments optimize the channeling         of energy from the primary reflector to the subreflector         and then to the feed horns.  The 70-m and 34-m HEF antennas         have 'shaped' primary and secondary reflectors, with forms         that are modified paraboloids.  This customization allows         more uniform illumination of one reflector by another.  The         BWG reflector shape is ellipsoidal.           On the 70-m antennas, the subreflector directs         received energy from the antenna onto a dichroic plate, a         device which reflects S-band energy to the S-band feed horn         and passes X-band energy through to the X-band feed horn.  In         the 34-m HEF, there is one 'common aperture feed,' which         accepts both frequencies without requiring a dichroic plate.         In the 34-m BWG, a series of small mirrors (approximately 2.5         meters in diameter) directs microwave energy from the         subreflector region to a collection area at the base of         the antenna -- typically in a pedestal room.  A retractable         dichroic reflector separates S- and X-band on some BWG         antennas or X- and Ka-band on others.  RF energy to be         transmitted into space by the horns is focused by the         reflectors into narrow cylindrical beams, pointed with high         precision (either to the dichroic plate or directly to the         subreflector) by a series of drive motors and gear trains         that can rotate the movable components and their support         structures.           The different antennas can be pointed by several means.  Two         pointing modes commonly used during tracking passes are         CONSCAN and 'blind pointing.' With CONSCAN enabled and a         closed loop receiver locked to a spacecraft signal, the         system tracks the radio source by conically scanning around         its position in the sky.  Pointing angle adjustments are         computed from signal strength information (feedback) supplied         by the receiver.  In this mode the Antenna Pointing Assembly         (APA) generates a circular scan pattern which is sent to the         Antenna Control System (ACS).  The ACS adds the scan pattern         to the corrected pointing angle predicts.  Software in the         receiver-exciter controller computes the received signal         level and sends it to the APA.  The correlation of scan         position with the received signal level variations allows the         APA to compute offset changes which are sent to the ACS.         Thus, within the capability of the closed-loop control         system, the scan center is pointed precisely at the apparent         direction of the spacecraft signal source.  An additional         function of the APA is to provide antenna position angles and         residuals, antenna control mode/status information, and         predict-correction parameters to the Area Routing Assembly         (ARA) via the LAN, which then sends this information to JPL         via the Ground Communications Facility (GCF) for antenna         status monitoring.           During periods when excessive signal level dynamics or low         received signal levels are expected (e.g., during an         occultation experiment), CONSCAN should not be used.  Under         these conditions, blind pointing (CONSCAN OFF) is used, and         pointing angle adjustments are based on a predetermined         Systematic Error Correction (SEC) model.           Independent of CONSCAN state, subreflector motion in at least         the z-axis may introduce phase variations into the received         Radio Science data.  For that reason, during certain         experiments, the subreflector in the 70-m and 34-m HEFs may         be frozen in the z-axis at a position (often based on         elevation angle) selected to minimize phase change and signal         degradation.  This can be done via Operator Control Inputs         (OCIs) from the LMC to the Subreflector Controller (SRC)         which resides in the alidade room of the antennas.  The SRC         passes the commands to motors that drive the subreflector to         the desired position.           Pointing angles for all antenna types are computed by         the NOCC Support System (NSS) from an ephemeris provided by         the flight project.  These predicts are received and archived         by the CMC.  Before each track, they are transferred to the         APA, which transforms the direction cosines of the predicts         into AZ-EL coordinates.  The LMC operator then downloads the         antenna predict points to the antenna-mounted ACS computer         along with a selected SEC model.  The pointing predicts         consist of time-tagged AZ-EL points at selected time intervals         along with polynomial coefficients for interpolation between         points.           The ACS automatically interpolates the predict points,         corrects the pointing predicts for refraction and         subreflector position, and adds the proper systematic error         correction and any manually entered antenna offsets.  The ACS         then sends angular position commands for each axis at the         rate of one per second.  In the 70-m and 34-m HEF, rate         commands are generated from the position commands at the         servo controller and are subsequently used to steer the         antenna.           When not using binary predicts (the routine mode for         spacecraft tracking), the antennas can be pointed using         'planetary mode' -- a simpler mode which uses right ascension         (RA) and declination (DEC) values.  These change very slowly         with respect to the celestial frame.  Values are provided to         the station in text form for manual entry.  The ACS         quadratically interpolates among three RA and DEC points         which are on one-day centers.           A third pointing mode -- sidereal -- is available for         tracking radio sources fixed with respect to the celestial         frame.           Regardless of the pointing mode being used, a 70-m antenna         has a special high-accuracy pointing capability called         'precision' mode.  A pointing control loop derives the         main AZ-EL pointing servo drive error signals from a two-         axis autocollimator mounted on the Intermediate Reference         Structure.  The autocollimator projects a light beam to a         precision mirror mounted on the Master Equatorial drive         system, a much smaller structure, independent of the main         antenna, which is exactly positioned in HA and DEC with shaft         encoders.  The autocollimator detects elevation/cross-         elevation errors between the two reference surfaces by         measuring the angular displacement of the reflected light         beam.  This error is compensated for in the antenna servo by         moving the antenna in the appropriate AZ-EL direction.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:ody.themis,THERMAL EMISSION IMAGING SYSTEM for ODY,THERMAL EMISSION IMAGING SYSTEM,"   Instrument Overview   ===================     The THEMIS flight instrument is a combined infrared and visible     multi-spectral pushbroom imager [CHRISTENSENETAL2002].  It has a     12-cm effective aperature telescope and co-aligned infrared and     visible area arrays.  The imaging system is comprised of a     three-mirror anastigmat telescope in a rugged enclosure, a     visible/infrared beamsplitter, a silicon focal plane for visible     detection, and a microbolometer for infrared detection.  A major     feature of this instrument is the use of an uncooled IR     microbolometer array operated at ambient temperature, eliminating     the need for complex passive or active cryogenic coolers.  A small     thermal electric cooler is used to stabilize the detector     temperature to 0.001K.  A calibration flag, the only moving part in     the instrument, provides thermal calibration and a DC restore     capability, and will also be used to protect the detectors from     unintentional direct illumination from the Sun when the instrument     is not in use.  The electronics provide digital data collection and     processing as well as the instrument control and data interface to     the spacecraft.  Infrared data will be collected in 9 wavelengths     centered from 6.6 to 15.0 microns at 100 meter per pixel resolution;     the 6.6 micron band is collected twice to result in a 10 band image.     Visible data will be collected in 5 spectral bands at a resolution     of 18 meters per pixel.  The instrument weighs 11.2 kg, is 29 cm by     37 cm by 55 cm in size, and consumes an orbital average power of     14W.         Optical Design     --------------       In order to integrate the visible and IR bands into a single       telescope, a fast, wide field-of-view reflective telescope has       been used.  The 3.5 degree (down-track) by 4.6 degree       (cross-track) field of view is achieved with a 3 mirror f/1.6       anastigmat telescope with an effective aperature of 12 cm and a       20-cm effective focal length.  The design allows for excellent       baffling to minimize scattered light.  It is based on a       diamond-turned bolt-together approach to telescope design,       fabrication, alightment and testing.  The manufacture utilized       high-precision machining capabilities that allowed the entire       optical stage to be machined and assembled without manual optical       component adjustments, and achieved diffraction-limited       performance in both the visible and infrared.  The optical       surfaces were machined with extremely tight tolerances (0.0002in).       The optical surfaces were machined directly from high order       aspheric equations.  The telescope was manufactured with aluminum       to reduce cost and to be significantly light-weight.  Nickel       plating and automated post polishing were used to keep the surface       scatter to levels unobtainable with conventional diamond turning       techniques.  The system was optimized to match the high signal       performance required for the IR imager and the spatial resolution       needed for the visible camera.  The 9 micron pitch of the visible       array maps to a ground sample distance (GSD) of 18 meters with an       MTF of approximately 0.1 at Nyquist.  Similarly, the 50 micron       pitch of the IR focal plane array maps to a GSD of 100 meters.         Focal Plane Assemblies     ----------------------       The THEMIS infrared design is based on a Raytheon hand-held       imager developed for rugged military use.  The microbolometer       array contains 320 pixels cross track by 240 pixels along track,       with a square 50 micron pixel pitch.  The microbolometer arrays       were grown directly on the surface of Readout Integrated Circuits       (ROIC) which are designed by Raytheon Santa Barbara Research       Center (SBRC) and utilize custom Digital Signal Processing       electronics.  Spectral discrimination in the infrared is achieved       with ten narrowband stripe filters.  Each filter covers 16 lines       in the along track directiona with an 8-line 'dead-space' between       filters.  The stripe filters were fabricated as separate stripe       filters butted together on the focal plane.  The along-track       detectors under a common spectral filter are combined by the use       of time-delay and integration (TDI) to improve the instrument's       signal-to-noise performatnce.  The calculated dwell time for a       single pixel, at a martian orbit of 400km and a 100-meter       footprint is 29.9 msec, which closely matches the 30Hz frame rate       for the standard microbolometer.  The ten stripe filter produces       nine ~1 micron wide wavelength bands from 6.6 to 15 microns.  Two       filters (bands 1 and 2) cover the same spectral region centered at       6.6 microns.  The nine IR wavelengths include eight surface-       sensing wavelengths (bands 1 - 9) and one atmospheric wavelength       (band 10).         The visible camera was supplied by Malin Space Science Systems       (MSSS) and is a derivative of the MS'98 MARDI camera.  It consists       of a small (5.5 x 8.5 x 6.5 cm, <500 gm) unit incorporating a       focal plane assembly with five color filters superimposed on the       CCD detector, a timing board, a data acquisition subsystem and a       power supply.  The visible sensor utilizes a Kodak KAI-1001 CCD.       This detector has 1024 by 1024 9-micrometer pixels (1018 x 1008       photoactive).  The visible imager used a filter plate mounted       directly over the area-array detector on the focal plane.  On the       plate are multiple narrowband filter strips, each covering the       entire cross-track width of the detector, but only a fraction of       the along-track portion of the detector.  The five filter bands       are centered near 425, 550, 650, 750, and 860 nanometers.  Band       selection is accomplished by selectively reading out only part of       the resulting frame for transmission to the spacecraft computer.       The imager uses 5 stripes each 192 pixels in along-track extent.       The entire detector is read out every 1.3 seconds.         Electronics Design     ------------------       Both the visible and infrared cameras utilized commercial,       off-the-shelf electonics with modifications to accommodate space       environmental requirements.  Dedicated, miniaturized electronics       provide ultra-stable, low-noise clock and bias signals to the       focal planes, stabilize IR focal plane temperature with 0.001       degree C, and perform analog and digital processing of the output       signals.         The microbolometer readout electronics includes an initial 8-bit       analog DC offset correction which occurs on the focal plane, an       Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) coverts the signals to 12-bit       words, which are then corrected for gain and offsets.  The       correction is provided by the electronics of the IR camera and       consists of a 12-bit fine offset and 8-bit gain and responsivity       adjustment, performed in real time on a pixel-by-pixel basis.       This process eliminates all the significant noise elements with       the exception of the fundamental random noise term.  This noise is       reduced by applying TDI to the corrected digital data.  Internal       THEMIS data processing in firnmware includes a 16:1 TDI processing       and lossless data compression for the IR bands using a hardware       Rice data compression algorithm chip.         The visible sensor requires 7 clock signals: a two-phase       vertical clock (V1/V2), a two-phase horizontal clock (H1/H2), a       sub-state clear clock (S), a reset clock (R), and a fast-dump       clock (F).  In addition, the ADC requires a convert clock.  The       amplified CCD signal is digitized by an Analog Devices AD1672       12-bit ADC running at its maximum rate of 3 MSPS.  For each pixel,       both reset and video levels are digitized and then subtracted in       the digital domain to perform correlated double sampling (CDS).       The digital electronics are responsible for clock generation,       sampling of the CCD signal, conversion of the 12-bit samples to       8-bit encoded pixels, storage of the pixels, and finally readout       of the pixels to the spacecraft.  The zero reference ('reset')       level for each pixel is digitized and stored in a register.  The       sum of the video plus zero reference ('video') level is then       digitized, and an arithmetic subtraction is performed to produce       the final result.  The CCD output only requires scaling to the       ADC range; no analog sampling, delay or differencing is required.       The digital signal processor within the visible sensor generates       the CCD clocks, reads the reset and video levels from the ADC,       performs the correlated double sampling subtraction, reduces the       pixel from 12 to 8 bits, applies lossless (2:1) first-difference       Huffman compression, and transmits it digitally with handshaking       over the serial communications interface to the spacecraft CPU.         The spacecraft interface electronics supply final processing of       the focal plane data, a data and command interface to the       spacecraft, and overall instrument power conditioning.  The bulk       of the interface electronics is performed using Actel Field       Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), that are packaged using a       mixture of conventional, and Sealed Chip-On-Board, High-Density       Multiple Interconnect technology and chip stack memory.  The       visible and IR subsystems have independent power supplies, the IR       power supply uses off-the-shelf modules and requires only a few       discrete components for input filtering to assure electromagnetic       compatibility with the rest of the spacecraft.  The spacecraft       processor performas final data stream formatting for both the IR       and the visible data.         Mechanical Design     -----------------       The THEMIS main frame is composed of aluminum and provides the       mounting interface to the spacecraft as well as the telescope       assembly, thermal blankets, and thermal control surface.  The       focal plane assemblies are mounted in the main frame using       brackets that provide for the necessary degrees of freedom for       alignment to the telescope.  The calibration shutter flag is       stored against a side wall that will maintain a known termperature       of the flag for calibration purposes.  Aluminum covers are       installed over the electronics circuit cards to provide EMI, RFI,       and radiation shielding as required.  There is no reliance on the       spacecraft for thermal control of THEMIS, other than the       application of replacement heater power when the instrument is       off.  The themal control plan includes the use of multi-layer       insulation blankets and appropriate thermal control surfaces to       provide a stable thermal environment and a heatsink for the       electronics and the TE termperature controller on the focal plane       arrays.         Performance Characteristics     ---------------------------       The predicted performance for the infrared bands produced noise       equivalent delta emissivity values ranging from 0.007 to 0.038       when viewing Mars at surface temperatures of 245K to 270K.  The       measured SNR values for each band at a reference surface       temperature of 245K are as follows:                         band 1,2 = 45                       band  3  = 107                       band  4  = 169                       band  5  = 193                       band  6  = 187                       band  7  = 194                       band  8  = 167                       band  9  = 128                       band 10  = 120         SNR ratios for the visible imager were computed for a low albedo       (0.25), flat-lying surface viewed at an incidence angle of 67.5       degrees under aphelion conditions.  The SNR values for this case       vary from 200 to 400.         Software     --------       The flight software for the IR imager resides on the spacecraft       computer and performs the formatting and data packetization.       Instrument commanding will be done using discrete spacecraft       commands to the THEMIS instrument over an RS-232 command line.       These commands will consist of:            1) IR camera on/off/standby;          2) visible camera on/off/stand-by;          3) calibration flag shutter control and electronics             synchronization;          4) instrument parameter settings (gain, offset, integration             time, etc.).         The visible imager software runs on two processors: the main       spacecraft CPU and the internal DSP.  The CPU will be responsible       for instrument operational commands and image post-processing and       compression.  The DSP is responsible for generating the CCD       clocks, emulating the required analog processing and transmitting       the data output to the CPU.  Lossless predictive compression is       implemented as part of the DSP firmware.  The algorithm employed       compresses each image line independently by encoding first       differences with a single, fixed Huffman table.  Selective readout       and pixel summing can also be performed by the DSP software.  The       result of an imaging command is a stream of raw or compressed       8-bit pixels.         Experience has shown that the volume of data likely to be       returned from a spacecraft often evolves during a mission.       Implementing data compression in software on the spacecraft       computer provides the maximum flexibility for the science and       spacecraft team to trade-off data return and buffer space usage.       The compression nodes developed are:            1) lossless predictive (capable of applications by the SDP in             real-time);          2) a relatively fast discrete cosine transform compression             (applied by the spacecraft CPU in 'near realtime' a few              tens of seconds);          3) high-quality lossy wavelet compression (applied by the CPU             on a longer timescale).         Each compression node has optional pixel summing.       Scientific Objectives   =====================     The objectives of the THEMIS experiment are:           1) to determine the mineralogy and petrology of localized            deposits associated with hydrothermal or sub-aqueous            environments, and to identify future landing sites likely to            represent these environments.         2) to search for pre-dawn thermal anomalies associated with            active sub-surface hydrothermal systems.         3) to study small-scale geologic processes and landing site            characteristics using morphologic and thermophysical            properties.         4) to investigate polar cap processes at all seasons using            infrared observations at high spatial resolution.         5) to provide a direct link to the global hyperspectral            mineral mappingfrom the Mars Global Surveyor TES            investigation by utilizing the same infrared spectral region            at high (100m) spatial resolution.       Calibration   ===========     The THEMIS instrument was radiometrically, spectrally, and     spatially calibrated prior to delivery.  Three categories of     calibration were performed: 1) spatial calibration; 2) spectral     calibration; and 3) radiometric calibration.  The radiometric     calibration included the absolute rediometry, the relative precision     (SNR), and the calibration stability during an image aquisition.     The data returned from the instrument in-flight will be converted     to scene radiance by:           1) adjusting for the gain and offset that were applied in the            instrument to optimize the dynamic range and signal            resolution for each scene;         2) correcting for drift or offest that occur between            observations of the calibrations flag;         3) converting signal to radiance using the instrument response            function determined prior to launch.       The response functions necessary to perform this calibration were     acquired prior to instrument delivery using a thermal vacuum chamber     at the SBRS facility.  See calibration report for details on IR and     visible image calibration methodologies [CHRISTENSEN2002]       THEMIS images will be calibrated using periodic views of the     internal calibration flag.  This flag will be closed, imaged, and     reopened at selectable intervals throughout each orbit.  Calibration     data are expected to be acquired every 3-5 minutes.  However, the     optimum spacing of these observations that meets the calibration     accuracy requirements, while minimizing the loss of surface     observations, will be determined in Mars orbit.       Operation of THEMIS   ===================     The THEMIS instrument is operated from ASU, building on the     facility and staff developed and in place for the MGS TES     investigation.  No special spacecraft operation or orientation is     required to obtain THEMIS data.  The instrument alternates between     data collection (<3.5 hours per day) and idle modes based on     available DSN downlink rates.  These modes will fall within     allocated resources (e.g.  power), and will not require power     cycling of the instrument.  All instrument commands are generated     at ASU, delivered electronically to the Odyssey Project, and     transmitted to the spacecraft.         Image Collection     ----------------       IR images can be acquired at selectable image lengths, in       multiples of 256 lines (25.6 km).  The image width is 320 pixels       (32 km from the nominal mapping orbit) and the length is variable,       as given by ((#frames)*256 lines) - 240.       The allowable number of frames varies from 2 to 256, giving       minimum and maximum image lengths of 272 and 65,296 lines       respectively (27.2 km and 6,530 km from the nominal mapping       orbit).  The bands returned to the ground are selectable.  THEMIS       visible images can be acquired simultaneously with IR images, but       the spacecraft can only transfer data from one of the two THEMIS       imagers at a time.  The IR image transfers data as it is being       collected, while the visible images are stroed within an internal       THEMIS buffer for later transfer to the spacecraft CPU.         Visible images can be acquired in framelets that are 1024 samples       crosstrack by 192 lines downtrack in size.  The images can be       composed of any selectable combination of bands and image length       that can be stored within the 3.734 Mbytes THEMIS internal buffer.       The size of an image is given by:             (1024 * 192) * #framelets * #bands < 3.734 Mbytes.       Thus, for example, either a single-band, 19 framelet (65.6 km)       image or a 5-band 3-framelet (10.3 km) image can be collected.       This buffer must be emptied to the spacecraft before a subsequent       image can be acquired.         Data Allocation     ---------------       THEMIS data collection will be distributed between the       mineralogic, temperature, and morphologic science objectives in       both targeted and global mapping modes.  A baseline observing plan       has been developed to prioritize the total data volume returned by       THEMIS between the different objectives.  This plan currently       devotes 62% of the total data to the IR imager and 38% to the       visible, averaged over the course of the Primary Mission.  In the       baselne plane the IR data will be further sub-divided into       9-wavelength daytime mineralogic observations (47% of total data       return) and 2-wavelength nighttime and polar temperature mapping       (15% of total data).  The visible data will be sub-divided into       monochromatic images (36% of total data) and 5-band multi-spectral       images (2%).         We have assumed a lossless data compression factor of 1.7 for       the IR imager and a combination of lossless (40%), and lossy with       compression factors of 4 (30%) and 6(30%) for the visible imager.       With these allocations, the Science and Relay phases of the       mission will fully map Mars in daytime IR and will map the planet       1.5 times in nighttime IR. The visible imaging will cover 60% of       the planet at 18 meter resolution in one band (80,000 18x50Km       frames) and <1% in 5-band color.  Tradeoffs between monochromatic       and multi-spectral imaging, as well as variations in the degree of       lossy compression , will be made to maximize the science return       from the visible imager.         THEMIS data volume return varies significantly will mission       phase due to variations n the Earth-Mars distance.  In addition,       the equator crossing local time will vary between ~15.5 H (24 H       equals one martian day) and 18 H over the course of the mission.       The first ~180-day phase of the mission provides some of the best       viewing conditions for the IR imager and will allow ~40% of the       planet to be observed.  IR images acquried during this period will       be carefully selected using the TES global mineral maps to focus       on the sites of highest mineralogical or morphological interest.       During a second IR mapping phase, when the data rates are again       high and the local time close to 16.5 H, the remaining ~60% of the       planet will be mapped.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:om.phx,MECA OPTICAL MICROSCOPE for PHX,MECA OPTICAL MICROSCOPE,"The MECA Optical Microscope (OM) is part of the Microscopy, Electrochemistry and Conductivity Analyzer (MECA) instrument suite. The optical, electronics, and illumination systems were designed, integrated, and tested by the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory (LPL) at the University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ. It was integrated with the MECA platform, including the sample wheel and translation stage (SWTS) and Atomic Force Microscope (AFM), at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, CA, where flight qualification was also performed. Charge Coupled Device (CCD) detector and readout electronics were delivered by the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research (MPS), Katlenburg-Lindau, Germany. The OM is a fixed-focus imaging system utilizing a 512 x 256 pixel active imaging area frame transfer CCD detector. It is designed to acquire images of particulate Martian material (soil, dust) at a spatial resolution of 4 microns/px. The samples to be imaged are moved to the optimum focus distance (about 14 mm away from the front end of the lens barrel) via a Sample Wheel Translation Stage (SWTS). The imaged area is then 2 mm * 1 mm. The samples are actively illuminated by red, green, blue or ultraviolet Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs). Color images of these samples can be generated by combining individual images acquired with red, green and blue illumination. The SWTS is shared by the OM and the Atomic Force Microscope (AFM). It contains a total of 69 substrates: 10 sets of 6 substrates plus 9 substrates holding OM and AFM calibration targets. Each set of 6 substrates consists of a weak and a strong magnet, 2 (identical) microbuckets (empty holes, 2 mm deep, 3 mm in diameter) for bulk sampling, a nanobucket (silicon textured substrate with micron-sized pits and pillar features for fixing particles and retaining the original size distribution of the acquired sample) and a sticky silicone substrate. The SWTS can be positioned to extend any one of ten sets of 6 substrates out of the MECA enclosure to receive soil samples from the Robot Arm (RA) or to collect airfall dust. Excess material is removed by passing the substrates under a blade positioned 0.2 mm above the surface, after which the samples are rotated for imaging by the OM and AFM. The overall sensitivity of the OM extends from 400 to 1020 nm and is chiefly controlled by the sensitivity of the CCD (extending from 380 to 1020 nm) and by a Schott GG420 glass filter (placed in between CCD and lens assembly) that blocks efficiently all light in the spectral range 380-400 nm. Therefore UV LED radiation (central wavelength ~ 375 nm and spectral width ~ 12 nm) cannot be directly detected by the CCD. Illuminating the target material with ultraviolet light can thus reveal fluorescence of that material. OM images belong to a series of images (Surface Stereo Imager (SSI), Robotic Arm Camera (RAC), AFM) that inspect areas of decreasing size with increasing resolution. OM images will be used to place AFM data in context.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:orm.galileo_zeiss3m5.nics,Near Infrared Camera Spectrometer (NICS),Near Infrared Camera Spectrometer (NICS),"NICS (Near Infrared Camera Spectrometer) is the TNG infrared (0.9-2.5 micron) multimode instrument which is based on a HgCdTe Hawaii 1024x1024 array. Its observing capabilities include imaging (4.2' x 4.2' f.o.v.), high-throughput low resolution spectroscopy (RS=50-500), medium resolution spectoscopy (max-R=2500), imaging polarimetry, spectropolarimetry and, when coupled to the adaptive optics module, nearly diffraction limited imaging.  Long slit spectroscopic observations are performed by inserting a slit at the entrance focal plane and a disperser (grism or prism) in the collimated beam. The table here lists the slits available in NICS which, thanks to the refurbishment works of Feb-Mar 2003, have now a very stable and repeatable positioning. All spectroscopic modes make use of the LF camera with a scale of 0.25 arcsec/pixel.

Note that the grisms have a fairly constant dispersion (angstroms/pix) throughout the spectrum and, therefore, their resolving power increases going towards the red. The Amici prism, on the contrary, delivers a spectrum with a quasi-constant resolving power and, therefore, its dispersion varies by more than a factor of 3 over its spectral range.  All the low resolution dispersers can be used in combination with the grey filters to take spectra of very bright objects which would otherwise saturate the array.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:pal.cwt,Carousel Wind Tunnel,Carousel Wind Tunnel," One of several wind tunnels operated by Arizona State University at the Planetary Aeolian Laboratory at NASA Ames Research  Laboratory, Moffett Field, CA, Building N242. This wind tunnel is no longer in operation.  A small portable wind tunnel used for low-gravity and reduced-pressure tests. It consists of two concentric cylinders constructed of clear Lexan plastic, each 30 cm deep. The outer cylinder is 60 cm in diameter and the inner cylinder is 40 cm in diameter; the space between the cylinders is the test section. The inner cylinder is spun at speeds of up to 3000 rpm by  a variable-speed motor driving a belt-and-pulley arrangement, which causes an airflow between the cylinders. Instrumentation consists of a tachometer, which measures the inner-cylinder rotational speed, and an accelerometer which measures the gravity. The tunnel has been used onboard the NASA KC-135 0g test aircraft to obtain particle thresholds at 0-1.8 g. This information provided verification of the equations used to correct for the difference between thresholds obtained at Earth gravity and those which would be obtained at martian or other gravity levels. The CWT also provided a convenient means of measuring the interparticle force, which becomes the predominant force resisting entrainment at 0g. This tunnel has also been used in  the vertical gun vacuum chamber (VGCG) to obtain particle thresholds as low as 15 mbar. This capability is especially useful when only a small amount of material is available for testing, because the particles are confined in the closed system and  not dispersed outside the tunnel, as is the case with MARSWIT. Threshold information is obtained primarily visually, with  videotaping of some of the runs for later analysis.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:pal.marswit,Mars Wind Tunnel,Mars Wind Tunnel,"  One of several wind tunnels operated by Arizona State University at the Planetary Aeolian Laboratory at NASA Ames Research   Laboratory, Moffett Field, CA, Building N242.              The tunnel is of open circuit design and is 12 meters long (40 ft.). It is constructed in five sections mounted on casters and  can be disassembled. The first three sections are 0.9 meters high by 1.2 meters wide in cross-section. The first section includes   the entry cone and is constructed of plywood and masonite. The next two sections have a plywood floor, plexiglas walls, and   plexiglas ceilings. These two sections comprise the test area. The last two sections are the tunnel diffuser. The vertical   dimension of these sections increases from 0.9 meters (3 ft.) to 1.6 meters (5.33 ft.). These sections are of plywood construction  and they contain the air ejector and fan drive systems.    During low pressure operation, tunnel flow is driven by the air ejector system. This system is powered by pressurized air supplied  by an Atlas Copco 75HP air compressor dedicated to building N242. This compressor produces air flow at a rate in excess of 260 CFM  with a maximum final pressure of 183 psi. The compressed air is stored in a 30,000 gallon tank located north of building N242.  Pressurized air is supplied to building N242 from this storage tank via a series of two and three inch pipe lines. The air supply  for the air ejecttor system arrives at a nominal pressure of 175 psi and is controlled by a two inch motor driven ball valve.  Maximum tunnel flow velocity with this system is 120 m/s (390 ft/sec) at 5.3 millibars (4 mm Hg). During operation at standard   atmospheric pressure, tunnel flow is generated by the fan drive system attached to the end of the tynnel. The maximum tunnel flow   velocity with this system is 10 m/s (33 ft/sec).    Tunnel instrumentation includes a static probe, a traversing boundary layer probe, and a temperature/humidity transmitter. The   probes are permanently attached in the test section of the tunnel and the temperature/humidity transmitter is suspended in the   tower adjacent to the tunnel. Data from these instruments are delivered to the control room computer for interpretation. A   removable flow straightening screen is currently in place to control boundary layer turbulence.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:pal.twt,Titan Wind Tunnel,Titan Wind Tunnel," One of several wind tunnels operated by Arizona State University at the Planetary Aeolian Laboratory at NASA Ames Research  Laboratory, Moffett Field, CA, Building N242.             The Titan Wind Tunnel (historically, the Venus Wind Tunnel) is a closed circuit wind tunnel with a test section of 20 cm  (8 in) in diameter and 122 cm (48 in) long. It has been designed to allow the removal of the test section from the tunnel circuit for access to the test area. Test plates can be substituted, instrumentation and media can be prepared for test runs, and final inspection of bed forms can be documented at the end of a test run. The floor plate installed properly, rests against the curved walls of the test section, level, approximately one third of the diameter distance above the  bottom of the test section pipe segment. There are four vieweing ports and one instrument port in the test section. One viewing port is located 30 cm (12 in) from the upwind end to the center of the 7.6 cm (3 in) diameter viewing port,  oriented facing out from the center of the tunnel circuit. The other three viewing ports are located 30 cm (12 in) from  the downwind end of the test section, providing a view from above. The diameter of this viewing port is 5 cm (2 in). The other two viewing ports are located on the sides of the test section opposite each other. They are also 7.6 cm (3 in) diameter. All viewing port centers match the center of the test section. All viewing port windows are Type W Safety Glass installed in lens horler assemblies (with gaskets) designed to withstand 600 psi pressure. The instrument port was added in 2010 to accomodate redesigned data collection equipment. It is located on the bottom of the test section at 61 cm  (24 in). A machined stainless steel plug is fitted to the port assembly, allowing for air line connections to a traversing pitot tube mechanism and electrical wiring for control of the traversing pito and data collection from the test section. Another pitot tube is located in the straight section of the tunnel circuit, opposite the removable test section in a  permanently fixed position in the center of the pipe to measure freestream wind sppeds. Both pitot tubes are plumbed  to a switch that directs which location measurements are being taken from. A custom designed differential pressure  transducer (manufactured by Tavis Corporation) is connected to the switch.  The tunnel is powered by a 1.5 hp D.C. variable speed motor which drives an eight bladed fan. The manipulation of gas flow within the tunnel is constructed of schedule 80, steel pipe. Originally pressure tested to 67 bar, the most recent certification was for pressures up to 20 bar. Modifications implemented for the Titan project include two revised pressurization methods:       In one system, pressurization is achieved by accessing the compressed air supply of building N242. The source of the   compressed air is an electrically powered air compressor manufactured by Atlas Copco in 2004, model GA55C. It is a    75 hp unit with a maximum output pressure of 183 psi. The pressurized air passes through a heatless desiccant dryer   manufactured by the Airtek Corporation. The twin tower unit is a model TW250 with a drying standard of ""dew point at    -40 degrees"". The compressed air from this system is stored in a 30 thousand gallon tank, before being delivered    inside the building. The delivery pressure varies from 150-165 psi. If the delivery pressure is insufficient for the   planned testing, a 2:1 air amplifier manufactured by Interface Devices, Inc. can be utilized to increase the tunnel   pressure to the desired level.      The other pressurization option accesses a compressed gas cylinder system. This system consists of eight ""K bottle""   cylinders mounted to a rack assembly with separate valves and regulators for each cylinder, connected by a pressure   certified assembly of air lines and valves to the tunnel. This pressurization method provides the option of using   a specific, purified gas rather than compressed air.     Inside the tunnel, in the straight section downstream of the motor and fan (and opposite the test section), is the   permanent pitot tube, oriented to face into the flow in the center of the flow. Further downstream, inside each  of the first two corners are ten curved tubes of 5 cm diameter. These tubes smooth the flow through the turns and   prevent large scale separation and turbulence. Between the two corners there is a hexal honeycomb structure to   additionally promote smooth flow. After the second turn and upstream of the test section there is a 47 cm diameter  stilling chamber with another hexal honeycomb flow straightener and a series of four 180 mesh screens. Immediately  beyond this point and adjacently upstream of the test section is an aluminum liner insert that provides a smooth  transition from 47 cm section to the 20 cm diameter test section. Downstream of the test section and before the   third corner is an aluminum diffuser insert that smoothly transitions an increase from 20 to 30 cm diameter. There  is a screen following the diffuser to prevent material being circulated into the fan section.

A wind tunnel capable of simulating the aeolian environment on Venus at NASA Ames Research Center as part of the Aeolian  Consortium. The tunnel began operation in 1982 and consisted of a closed-circuit wind tunnel approximately 6 m long by  3 m wide. The experiment test section is about 700 cm long by 20 cm in diameter. The working fluid in the tunnel was carbon dioxide; for venusian simulations, the tunnel operated at 35 bar pressure, which at ambient temperature produces the same  fluid density (the critical parameter for most aeolian processes) for carbon dioxide as at 90 bar and 735 K, the nominal  venusian environment. The tunnel was used primarily for conducting particle threshold experiments, studying ripple dynamics,  and determining particle fluxes and velocities.

A half-wave plate in front of a calcite block splits the incoming radiation into two components with polarization planes mutually orthogonal to each other.  Rotation of the half-wave plate by steps of 45 degrees and corresponding measurements of the intensities of the two rays allow the observer to derive the values of the Stokes parameters and hence the value of the degree of linear polarization and the position angle. The construction of the polarimeter allows a direct elimination of the sky background polarization.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:pvmp.lp.lnms,NEUTRAL MASS SPECTROMETER for PIONEER VENUS LARGE PROBE,PIONEER VENUS LARGE PROBE NEUTRAL MASS SPECTROMETER,"       INSTRUMENT OVERVIEW     ===================         The Large Probe Neutral Mass Spectrometer (LNMS) has a mass of 10.9 kg, a volume of 10650 cubic cm, and uses 14 W power.        The instrument comprises a miniature magnetic sector-field mass analyzer, a gas inlet and pumping system, and an electronics        (microprocessor) package all mounted on a 31 x 36 cm baseplate. The inlet is mounted so it protruded through the wall of the        shell just below the equator. The gases entered the apparatus through two microleaks, passed through the spectrometer and        then to one zirconium-aluminum-alloy and two zirconium-graphite chemical getters. An ion getter pumping system was used to        transfer gases. The instrument also had a noble gas enrichment cell, the Isotope Ratio Measurement Cell (IRMC), which        collected an atmospheric sample at the beginning of instrument operation. This sample was purged of carbon dioxide using        sorption and getter pumping during the descent to enrich the inert gases in the cell, and then introduced the into the mass        spectrometer just before parachute jettison.         The inlet system consisted of a primary microleak and a secondary microleak. The primary miroleak had a conductance of 0.0001        cubic mm per second. The secondary microleak was larger (0.001 cubic mm per second) and was only used in the upper atmosphere        where the pressure was lower. The secondary was open for approximately 12 minutes and was valved off shortly before parachute        jettison, which took place at about 47 km.         The single focusing magnetic sector-field mass spectrometer consisted of the electron bombardment ion source, with selectable        electron energies of 70 eV, 30 eV, or 22 eV, a magnetic momentum analyzer and a detector system. The detector had two electron        multiplier-counter channels, one covering 1 - 16 amu and the other covering 15 - 208 amu. The instrument was designed to measure        a preselected set of 232 mass peaks. A complete spectrum of the 232 mass peaks was scanned in 58 seconds at the rate of 4 peaks        per second. 6 seconds were required for background readings and returning the peak stepping program. Thus each scan covered 64        seconds. It also had two calibration gases containing 136Xe+, 136Xe++, and CH3+ producing peaks at 135.907, 67.954, and 15.035 amu.         The instrument was fully activated at 64 km altitude (after heat shield ejection at 67 km) by exposing the inlets to the atmosphere        through use of a breakseal cap. Prior to this the instrument was operated for 4 scans to establish background peak amplitudes. The        end of the 4th scan and the entire 5th scan have no data, this is presumably related to the instrument turn-on procedure. The IRMC        gases were collected at approximately 62 km altitude. The first 17 minutes of data collection occurred while the probe was descending        under the parachute. Just before parachute jettison the IRMC cell gases were introduced into the instrument. After the parachute was        jettisoned at 47 km altitude, the probe continued to descend and collect data for another 37 minutes until loss of signal at the        surface (at 19:39:53 UT). Each 64 second scan took place over an average altitude change of roughly 1.2 km. 51 scans were taken over        the course of the descent.         The normal electron energy was 70 eV, but three times during the descent (beginning at altitudes 54, 30, and 9 km) the ionization        energy was cycled on successive scans of the mass spectrum to 30 and 22 eV. (All doubly charged ion species are removed from the        spectrum when low energy electrons are used.) Apparently from approximately 50 to 28 km altitude the microleaks were blocked by an        overcoating of cloud particle materials, mainly background residual gases and gases from the blocking material were detected. Below        about 30-28 km the primary leak unblocked and reopened and flow returned to normal. The final scan began to an altitude of 0.2 km        and ended before it was completed when the probe hit the ground and the signal ceased.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:pvo.oad,ORBITER ATMOSPHERIC DRAG (OAD) FOR PIONEER VENUS,ORBITER ATMOSPHERIC DRAG (OAD) FOR PIONEER VENUS,"       INSTRUMENT OVERVIEW     ===================           The Orbiter Atmospheric Drag (OAD) experiment made use of the spacecraft S-band and X-band radio signals for data          measurements. The objectives were (1) to establish the diurnal variation of thermospheric density and density scale          height (2) to determine the relationship of solar wind variations to variations in atmospheric density, (3) to determine          the relationship of long and short term variation in solar extreme UV radiation to density variations, (4) to search          for phenomena such as a semi-annual variation and super rotation of the thermosphere, and (5) to formulate a thermospheric          model for the Venusian atmosphere.           The OAD experiment worked by measuring the Doppler shift in X and S band transmissions to the Deep Space Network. The          shift would give the spacecraft acceleration along a line-of-sight from the spacecraft to the receiver. The accelerations          at periapsis, when the orbiter was in the region of highest atmospheric density and the drag effect was greatest, were used,          along with the spacecraft mass, and spacecraft orientation (giving the cross-section), to give a drag coefficient. This,          combined with atmospheric models, gave an estimate of the atmospheric density at that altitude. Since the periapsis altitude          changed with time, different depths in the atmosphere would be sampled. The effects of the drag on the evolution of the orbital          period and inclination were also used with, and fed into, an atmospheric model. The results could be used to study diurnal and          semi-annual variations, variations with solar activity, and possibly the super-rotation of the upper atmosphere.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:pvo.ocpp,CLOUD PHOTOPOLARIMETER (OCPP) FOR PIONEER VENUS,CLOUD PHOTOPOLARIMETER (OCPP) FOR PIONEER VENUS,"       INSTRUMENT OVERVIEW     ===================       The Cloud Photopolarimeter (OCPP) used a simplified version of the Imaging Photopolarimeter (IPP) flown on Pioneers 10 and 11      to provide low-resolution, four-color maps of the Venusian cloud cover with a high-resolution imaging capability near apocenter.      The principal objective of this investigation was to determine the properties of the clouds and haze, including the vertical and      horizontal distribution of the particles, cloud particle size and refractive index, the cloud-top height, and the number density      of particles.       The instrument consists of a 3.7 cm Cassegrain telescope with a 15.7 cm focal length, backed by a 16 position filter wheel. The      filter wheel holds diagonal reflectors and various filters that feed to one of three UV enhanced silicon photodiode detectors that      send the signals to four different channels. Each detector represents one mode of the OCPP. The imaging mode has a 365-nm filter,      a 0.4 x 0.45 mrad aperture field of view, and a single detector that feeds into the imaging channel. It can provide scan lines      containing 1016 8-bit measurements of intensity (radiance), with a resolution of 30 km at the subspacecraft point. Approximately      3.5 hours are required to image the full planetary disk, or five full images in the roughly 18 hours of the orbit centered on apoapsis.      Smaller fractions of the disk can also be imaged at higher cadence. The channel is sampled every 0.488 ms (0.610 ms low sample rate),      absolute radiometric accuracy is 5%. This technique gives high photometric precision to study vertical atmospheric structure, individual      features in the clouds, and accurarte tracking of cloud-level winds.       The photopolarimetry mode uses four passband filters centered at 270 nm (far ultraviolet), 365 nm (ultraviolet), 550 nm (visible),      and 935 nm (near infrared), with three half-wave retarder positions on the filter wheel for each of these. The field of view is      6.5 x 8 mrad, giving a resolution of 250 - 500 km at the subsatellite point. The output from the filter wheel passes through a Wollaston      prism that send two orthogonally polarized beam to two detectors, which feed their measurements to two photopolarimetry channels. The      two signals are sampled simultaneously every 9.52 ms (28.6 ms low sample rate), with 11 bit a/d conversion, and an absolute radiometric      accuracy of 5%. This mode measures the polarization of scattered sunlight, and the variation in polarization with phase angle and zenith      angle. Physical properties of the aerosols and cloud particles can be determined from the polarization as a function of phase angle and      wavelength, and the pressure at the cloud tops and vertical distribution of aerosols can be studied using the polarization as a function      of zenith angle and wavelength.       The limb-scan mode uses a 690 nm filter with a 0.3 x 0.35 mrad field of view aperture and a single detector that feeds into the limb-scan      channel. This mode is used when the orbiter is near periapsis and involves scans of visible light across the limb of the planet when the      spaceraft is near periapsis, giving a resolution of about 1 km for latitudes within 45 degrees of periapsis. The signal channel is sampled      every 0.310 ms (0.397 ms low sample rate) with 8 bit conversion, absolute radiometric accuracy is 5%. These scans are used to determine the      vertical structure of high-altitude haze layers.       There is a calibration lamp for periodic calibration checks. The instrument can view 0 to 145 degrees from the spacecraft spin axis, the angle      can be set by ground command. It uses the 5 rpm spin of the spacecraft to scan the field of view across the planet, and the spacecraft orbital      motion provides translation of the scan lines for two-dimensional images. It uses a first in/first out 8192 bit memory (3072 bit section for      photopolarimetry mode). The data format is 56 bits of status information followed by 8136 bits of data. The instrument is 22 x 28 x 46 cm in      size with a mass of 5 kg, and uses 5.4 W power.

The aims of the investigation were to perform an analysis        of VLF electric fields at Venus and to elucidate the plasma interactions        between the solar wind and the ionospheric or exospheric plasma. The        role of plasma instabilities in modifying the heat flux from the solar        wind and in thermalizing newly-born ions from Venus was also studied.

At the 512 bps satellite mode,        one frequency scan per second was obtained.              The Pioneer Venus plasma wave instrument has a self-contained       balanced electric dipole (effective length = 0.75 m) and a       4-channel spectrum analyzer (30-percent band width filters with       center frequencies at 100 Hz, 5.4 kHz, and 30 kHz).  The       channels are continuously active and the highest Orbiter       telemetry rate (2048 bps) yields 4 spectral scans/s.  The total       mass of 0.55 kg includes the electronics, the antenna, and the       antenna deployment mechanism.

Brace, R.F.  Theis, J.R.  Cutler, W.H.       Pinkus, and R.B.  Kaplan, 'Pioneer Venus Orbiter Electron       Temperature Probe', IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote       Sensing, January 1980. [KREHBIELETAL1980].         ABSTRACT - The Orbiter Electron Temperature Probe (OETP)       instrumentation and measurement technique has been designed to       perform in-situ measurements of electron temperature and       electron and ion density in the ionosphere of Venus.  Adaptive       sweep voltage circuitry continuously tracks the changing       electron temperature and spacecraft potential while       auto-ranging electrometers adjust their gain in response to the       changing plasma density.  Control signals used in the       instrument to achieve this automatic tracking provide a       continuous monitor of the ionospheric parameters without       telemetering each volt-ampere curve.  Internal data storage       permits high data rate sampling of selected raw characteristic       curves for low rate transmission to Earth.  These curves are       used to verify or correct the inflight processed data.  Sample       in orbit measurements are presented to demonstrate instrument       performance.         I.  INTRODUCTION         THE PIONEER VENUS Orbiter Electron Temperature Probe (OETP) is       one of several instruments used on the orbiter to perform       in-situ measurements of the ionospheric plasma of Venus.  The       instrument employs cylindrical Langmuir probes to measure the       electron temperature, Te, the electron and ion densities, Ne       and Ni, and the spacecraft potential, Vs.  To provide high       spatial resolution of these parameters the instrument takes       several hundred volt-ampere curves during each brief passage       through the ionosphere.  Owing to the limited telemetry rate       available to each instrument, circuitry was included for       inflight processing of the volt- ampere curves.  Onboard       storage of raw data from selected curves was provided to permit       ground confirmation of the inflight processing method.  Prior       to launch, the instrument design was outlined briefly by Brace       in a paper edited by Colin and Hunten (1977) [BRACE1977].  The       purpose of this paper is to present a a more detailed account       of the instrument and some of the data acquired at Venus to       illustrate how the instrument performs and how the ground data       analysis is used to verify the flight measurements.  Early       results from this experiment have been reported.       [BRACEETAL1979A] [BRACEETAL1979B] [BRACEETAL1979C]         II.  THEORY OF THE METHOD         The OETP is the latest spaceflight version of cylindrical       electrostatic probe of Langmuir probe instrumentation. I.       Langmuir and H.  Mott-Smith, Jr., first reported use of the       electrostatic probe in a laboratory plasma in 1924       [LANGMUIRETAL1924].  The cylindrical probe technique has been       used extensively to characterize the Earth's ionosphere       [BRACE1970], most recently on board the Atmosphere Explorer       (AE) satellites [BRACEETAL1973].  The three AE instruments with       their adaptive control circuitry and auto ranging electrometer       provided the basis for the OETP instrument.         Langmuir probe theory and application has been widely reported       in the literature [BRACE1977] [BRACEETAL1979A] [BRACEETAL1979B]       [BRACEETAL1979C] [LANGMUIRETAL1924] [BRACE1970] [BRACEETAL1973]       [HOEGYETAL1973].  Here it will suffice to provide a brief       description of the technique and to remind the reader of the       theoretical volt-ampere curve produced by a Langmuir probe in a       plasma as shown in Fig.  1 [KREHBIELETAL1980].  The curve       begins in the ion saturation region with the probe potential       sufficiently negative to prohibit plasma electrons from       reaching the probe.  At this point, current to the probe is due       only to ions.  In the retardation region where the probe       potential is less negative, the more energetic electrons       overcome the retarding potential, and produce an exponentially       increasing current.  The electron temperature Te determines the       power of the exponential with lower Te yielding a narrower       retarding region.  In the electron saturation region, the probe       is positive with respect to the plasma and therefore attracts       additional electrons from the plasma.  Equations appropriate to       the three regions of the curve are given below.         In the ion saturation region at 90 degree angle of attack       [HOEGYETAL1973]         Ii = ANiew/pi(1 + kTi/miw2 + 2eV/miw2)1/2 (1)           In the electron retardation region [BRACEETAL1979A]           Ie = ANee(kTe/2pime)1/2 exp(eV/kTe0.  (2)           In the electron saturation region [MOTTSMITHETAL1926]       [SPENCERETAL1965]           Ie = (ANee/pi)(2eV/me)1/2 (3) where         Ne electron density Ni ion density Te electron temperature Ti       ion temperature A collector surface area w collector speed with       respect to plasma k Boltzmann constant mi mean ion mass me       electron mass V collector voltage with respect to the plasma e       electron charge.         OETP measurements are made with respect to spacecraft ground.       This causes the voltage applied to the probe VA to be       translated by the spacecraft potential Vs, as illustrated in       Fig.  1 [KREHBIELETAL1980].  Special steps must be taken to       account for this and to assure a stable spacecraft potential.       This will be described later.       Instrument Overview     ===================       III.  THE EXPERIMENTAL ARRANGEMENT         The OETP instrumentation system consists of two cylindrical       sensors and a central electronics unit. Fig.  2       [KREHBIELETAL1980] illustrates the relative position of the       sensors and the larger appendages of the spacecraft.  The       radial sensor is mounted at the end of a 1-m boom which was       folded against the solar array and deployed after Venus orbit       insertion so as to be perpendicular to the spacecraft spin       axis.  The axial sensor is mounted on a fixed boom which places       it 0.4 m away from the spacecraft forward surface.  Because the       axis of the axial sensor is parallel to the spin axis it       maintains a relatively constant angle of attack to the incident       plasma and is therefore not subject to spin modulation.         To provide an adequate path for return current to the plasma,       the spacecraft provides 1.73 m2 of exposed conducting area       which is spacecraft ground.  This area consists of a metal band       around the solar array, a metal mesh over the outer kapton       surface of the forward thermal blanket, and the outer surface       of the magnetometer boom.  Silicone rubber was applied to all       solar cell edges and exposed electrical conductors making up       the solar array to insulate these positive potential areas from       the plasma and thus minimize the electron current they would       otherwise collect producing a concomitant change in spacecraft       potential.         A.  The Central Electronics         The OETP central electronics unit contains independent       electrometer amplifiers and adaptive sweep voltage circuitry to       service each probe. Fig.  3 [KREHBIELETAL1980] is a simplified       functional block diagram of the system.  Each amplifier feeds       its output into the common A/D converter and data handling       circuitry.  The autoranging electrometer and adaptive sweep       voltage circuits are identical to that employed in the three AE       missions [BRACEETAL1973].  The signal multiplexing (Mux), A/D       conversion, data formatting, and First-In/First-Out memory       (FIFO) are new features to permit the inflight processing and       recovery of data, a capability required by the lower data rate       available from the orbiter.  The radial probe electrometer has       a sensitivity range of 1 x 10 to the neg.  10 power to 1 x 10       to the neg.  6 power A/V, while the axial probe electrometer       has a sensitivity range of 1 x 10 to the neg.  nine power to 1       x 10 to the neg.  5 power A/V.  Electrometer sensitivity is       automatically adjusted to one of 1024 possible values.       Electrical power is provided by a common dc/dc converter having       separate floating outputs for each of the two electrometers.         Adaptive circuitry is provided to adjust the sweep voltage to       resolve that region of the volt-ampere curve needed to derive       Ni, Ne, Te, and Vs and to track changes in Te and Vs       encountered along the orbit.  The adaptive process provides a       more continuous monitor of these plasma parameters than could       be obtained if we were to rely solely on ground-based analysis       of volt-ampere curves produced by the instrument, given the       available data rate.  The VA generator converges on the proper       starting value VA Start, and the proper rate of change VA Slope       through an iterative process involving the auto-ranging       electrometer and the adaptive VA circuitry.  When the adaptive       process is completed, usually within two sweeps, the curves are       properly framed to maximize the resolution of the measured       parameters.  Once proper framing had been achieved, it is       maintained by slight adjustments in VA Start, VA Slope, and       electrometer gain which track the changes in electron       temperature, density, and spacecraft potential.         An idealized 1/2-s instrument measurement cycle of applied       voltage, and the resulting electrometer output for a properly       framed curve are shown in Fig.  4 [KREHBIELETAL1980].  Also       shown are the parameters used to carry out the adaptive process       and to achieve the inflight analysis.  The cycle begins at time       T0 by setting VA equal to VA Start as determined from       parameters measured during the previous curve.  After a       settling time the electrometer auto-ranging algorithm is       initiated to adjust the electrometer gain as needed to drive       its output to the -3.30-Vthreshold.  Current to the sensor at       this time is entirely ion current and is used to determine Ni.       At time T1 the VA is increased linearly at a rate also       determined from the previous curve.  The VA and electrometer       outputs are monitored by level detectors.  When the       electrometer output reaches +1.41 V a level detector starts a       counter and the value of VA at T2 is measured.  When the       electrometer output reaches +9.50 V, a second level detector       stops the counter and the value of VA at T3 is measured.  At T3       the electrometer downranges by one decade and displays the rest       of the volt-ampere curve until the linear sweep is stopped at       T4.  At T4 a fixed 2-V step is added to drive the sensor into       the electron saturation region.  The electrometer then       downranges until its output is on scale and a reading of output       voltage and gain are taken and used to determine Ne.         In each 1/2-s instrument cycle we are thus able to determine,       from each electrometer, Ni from the gain and electrometer       output just prior to T1, Te from the change in VA which       produced a factor of e change in electrometer output, and Ne       from the gain and electrometer output during the Ne sample       time.  The curve framing process continues by automatically       computing new values of VA Slope and VA Start.  VA Slope is       computed from our definition of a properly framed curve which       requires that the full amplitude of VA be ten times the value       of the change in VA from T2 to T3 when the 1.41- and 9.50-V       thresholds are reached.  VA Start is computed using (4) which       places the exponential electron retardation region such that       the 9.50-V threshold is reached at 86 percent of the sweep       interval.         VA Start = 8.6 VA at T2 - 7.6 VA at T3.  (4)         If the VA at T1 does not provide a net ion current to the       collector or if the electrometer fails to reach the +9.50-V       output, called the T3 threshold, the VA generator will preset       to the 'fault' condition for the next sweep causing VA to start       at -7 V and sweep up to +5V.  The fault sweep amplitude is       sufficient to locate the operating region of the volt-ampere       curve and to permit the convergence algorithm to repeat at the       beginning of the following sweep.         As a safeguard against unforeseen difficulties which might       cause our adaptive approach to fail, a fixed amplitude sweep       mode can be selected by ground command in which a sequence of       high and low voltage sweeps are applied to either or both       sensors.  The high VA was -7 to +5 V and the low VA was -2 to       +1 V.  In this mode a bias voltage of +/- 1 V can be added to       account for Vs uncertainties.  The fixed sweep mode is not       normally used because the adaptive mode yields better resolved       stored curves.         B.  The Sensors and Booms         A sensor with its guard electrode and a portion of the boom are       schematically shown in Fig.  5 [KREHBIELETAL1980].  The guard       electrode, driven at VA, is the exposed inner shield of a rigid       triaxial boom fabricated with titanium and teflon.  The outer       triaxial shield is held at spacecraft ground potential.  A       special white conductive paint, GSFC Code No.  NS43C       [SHAI1978], was applied to the outer surface of the booms to       provide thermal control.  Flight sensors were screwed onto the       boom center conductor and held in place with a high temperature       silicone (Dow Corning X 12561, silver filled for electrical       conductivity) to assure that the sensors remained in place       during the launch vibration.         The accuracy of the temperature measurements is affected by the       characteristics of the sensor surface [SMITH1972].  In       particular, the work function of different crystal surfaces can       vary by as much as several tenths of a volt and thus introduce       an uncertainty in the value of V in (1) - (3).  To reduce this       error the collectors were fabricated using a chemical vapor       deposition (CVD) process.  Studies of the CVD Rhenium show that       Rhenium deposited by the pyrolyctic decomposition of Rhenium       pentachloride (ReCl5) show a very high degree of crystal       orientation.  Rhenium deposited in this manner exhibits a       (0001) preferred orientation [YANG1972] perpendicular to the       plane of growth.  Cylindrical tubes of this type have yielded       uniform vacuum work functions of 5.1 eV.  Molybdenum deposited       from MoCl6 also shows a very high degree of crystal       orientation.  Thus both materials become candidates for sensor       materials.         Fig.  6 [KREHBIELETAL1980] shows part of a cross section of a       collector having a CVD Rhenium surface deposited on a       polycrystalline substrate.  Flight collectors were selected on       the basis of examining similar cross sections cut from one end       of the collector and from volt-ampere curves taken in       laboratory plasmas.  The radial collector surface is Rhemium       and the axial is Molybdenum.         C.  Measurements Format         The orbiter is able to operate in several data formats and at       spacecraft data rates from 16 to 2048 b/s.  The OETP is       designed for optimum operation when its output data rates are       80, 128, or 160 b/s, one of which is normally used during a       periapsis pass.  Various instrument data formats can be       selected by command to provide for more or less dense coverage       depending on such factors as spacecraft bit rate and whether       the OETP data system is dedicated to one sensor or shared by       both of them.         IV.  Verification of Inflight Analysis         To permit ground calibration of the values of Ni, Ne, and Te       determined by the inflight processing, the instrument       periodically samples volt-ampere curves from either or both       electrometers.  The electrometer output is measured at 50       equally spaced points between T1 and T4.  The FIFO memory is       used to store the fifty measurements , made at 1132 b/s, for       later readout at the lower spacecraft telemetry rate. Fig.  7       [KREHBIELETAL1980] illustrates the ground analysis of such a       stored curve taken from orbit 112.  The solid line represents a       least squares fit of a straight line (ion current) and       exponential (electron current) to the actual data points within       the electron retardation region.         V.  Illustration of Operation at Venus         Fig.  8 [KREHBIELETAL1980] is a computer plot of the values of       Te and Ne taken from a single pass of the orbiter through the       nightside ionosphere.  The line segments connect the inflight       values and reveal the small-scale spatial structure which is       often present.  The asterisks represent the values of Te and Ne       derived later by computer fitting stored volt-ampere curves of       the type illustrated in Fig.  7 [KREHBIELETAL1980].  Values       derived from the stored curves are used to normalize the       inflight processed data.  Thus through the use of on-board       processing of curves, high spatial resolution is achieved       without sacrificing the accuracy provided by ground computer       fitting of raw volt-ampere curves.  As of this writing more       than 250 passes through the ionosphere of Venus have been       completed and the instrument continues to operate well.

Thus both materials become candidates for sensor       materials.         Fig.  6 [KREHBIELETAL1980] shows part of a cross section of a       collector having a CVD Rhenium surface deposited on a       polycrystalline subtrate.  Flight collectors were selected on       the basis of examining similar cross sections cut from one end       of the collector and from volt-ampere curves taken in       laboratory plasmas.  The radial collector surface is Rhemium       and the axial is Molybdenum.         Instrument Electronics     ======================       A.  The Central Electronics         The OETP central electronics unit contains independent       electrometer amplifiers and adaptive sweep voltage circuitry to       service each probe. Fig.  3 [KREHBIELETAL1980] is a simplified       functional block diagram of the system.  Each amplifier feeds       its output into the common A/D converter and data handling       circuitry.  The autoranging electrometer and adaptive sweep       voltage circuits are identical to that employed in the three AE       missions [BRACEETAL1973].  The signal multiplexing (Mux), A/D       conversion, data formatting, and First-In/First-Out memory       (FIFO) are new features to permit the inflight processing and       recovery of data, a capability required by the lower data rate       available from the orbiter.  The radial probe electrometer has       a sensitivity range of 1 x 10 to the neg.  10 power to 1 x 10       to the neg.  6 power A/V, while the axial probe electrometer       has a sensitivity range of 1 x 10 to the neg.  nine power to 1       x 10 to the neg.  5 power A/V.  Electrometer sensitivity is       automatically adjusted to one of 1024 possible values.       Electrical power is provided by a common dc/dc converter having       separate floating outputs for each of the two electrometers.         Adaptive circuitry is provided to adjust the sweep voltage to       resolve that region of the volt-ampere curve needed to derive       Ni, Ne, Te, and Vs and to track changes in Te and Vs       encountered along the orbit.  The adaptive process provides a       more continuous monitor of these plasma parameters than could       be obtained if we were to rely solely on ground-based analysis       of volt-ampere curves produced by the instrument, given the       available data rate.  The VA generator converges on the proper       starting value VA Start, and the proper rate of change VA Slope       through an iterative process involving the auto-ranging       electrometer and the adaptive VA circuitry.  When the adaptive       process is completed, usually within two sweeps, the curves are       properly framed to maximize the resolution of the measured       parameters.  Once proper framing had been achieved, it is       maintained by slight adjustments in VA Start, VA Slope, and       electrometer gain which track the changes in electron       temperature, density, and spacecraft potential.         An idealized 1/2-s instrument measurement cycle of applied       voltage, and the resulting electrometer output for a properly       framed curve are shown in Fig.  4 [KREHBIELETAL1980].  Also       shown are the parameters used to carry out the adaptive process       and to achieve the inflight analysis.  The cycle begins at time       T0 by setting VA equal to VA Start as determined from       parameters measured during the previous curve.  After a       settling time the electrometer auto-ranging algorithm is       initiated to adjust the electrometer gain as needed to drive       its output to the -3.30-V threshold.  Current to the sensor at       this time is entirely ion current and is used to determine Ni.       At time T1 the VA is increased linearly at a rate also       determined from the previous curve.  The VA and electrometer       outputs are monitored by level detectors.  When the       electrometer output reaches +1.41 V a level detector starts a       counter and the value of VA at T2 is measured.  When the       electrometer output reaches +9.50 V, a second level detector       stops the counter and the value of VA at T3 is measured.  At T3       the electrometer downranges by one decade and displays the rest       of the volt-ampere curve until the linear sweep is stopped at       T4.  At T4 a fixed 2-V step is added to drive the sensor into       the electron saturation region.  The electrometer then       downranges until its output is on scale and a reading of output       voltage and gain are taken and used to determine Ne.         In each 1/2-s instrument cycle we are thus able to determine,       from each electrometer, Ni from the gain and electrometer       output just prior to T1, Te from the change in VA which       produced a factor of e change in electrometer output, and Ne       from the gain and electrometer output during the Ne sample       time.  The curve framing process continues by automatically       computing new values of VA Slope and VA Start.  VA Slope is       computed from our definition of a properly framed curve which       requires that the full amplitude of VA be ten times the value       of the change in VA from T2 to T3 when the 1.41- and 9.50-V       thresholds are reached.  VA Start is computed using (4) which       places the exponential electron retardation region such that       the 9.50-V threshold is reached at 86 percent of the sweep       interval.         VA Start = 8.6 VA at T2 - 7.6 VA at T3.  (4)         If the VA at T1 does not provide a net ion current to the       collector or if the electrometer fails to reach the +9.50-V       output, called the T3 threshold, the VA generator will preset       to the 'fault' condition for the next sweep causing VA to start       at -7 V and sweep up to +5V.  The fault sweep amplitude is       sufficient to locate the operating region of the volt-ampere       curve and to permit the convergence algorithm to repeat at the       beginning of the following sweep.         As a safeguard against unforeseen difficulties which might       cause our adaptive approach to fail, a fixed amplitude sweep       mode can be selected by ground command in which a sequence of       high and low voltage sweeps are applied to either or both       sensors.  The high VA was -7 to +5 V and the low VA was -2 to       +1 V.  In this mode a bias voltage of +/- 1 V can be added to       account for Vs uncertainties.  The fixed sweep mode is not       normally used because the adaptive mode yields better resolved       stored curves.         Detectors     =========       The OETP instrumentation system consists of two cylindrical       sensors and a central electronics unit. Fig.  2       [KREHBIELETAL1980] illustrates the relative position of the       sensors and the larger appendages of the spacecraft.  The       radial sensor is mounted at the end of a 1-m boom which was       folded against the solar array and deployed after Venus orbit       insertion so as to be perpendicular to the spacecraft spin       axis.  The axial sensor is mounted on a fixed boom which places       it 0.4 m away from the spacecraft forward surface.  Because the       axis of the axial sensor is parallel to the spin axis it       maintains a relatively constant angle of attack to the incident       plasma and is therefore not subject to spin modulation.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:pvo.ogbd,GAMMA RAY BURST DETECTOR (OGBD) FOR PIONEER VENUS,GAMMA RAY BURST DETECTOR (OGBD) FOR PIONEER VENUS,"       INSTRUMENT OVERVIEW     ===================       The Gamma Ray Burst Detector (OGBD) experiment was an omnidirectional gamma-ray detector employing two Phoswich scintillation      spectrometers sensitive to photons from 0.1 to 2.0 MeV, used with logic circuitry to detect the beginning of a gamma event and      to initiate a period of rapid data collection. Data were stored in a memory unit for subsequent transmission to Earth.      Confirmation that a true gamma event had occurred was obtained by comparison with results from other experiments in Earth satellites.      This experiment provided long-baseline time correlations necessary for calculating accurate source locations.       The purpose fo the OGBD was to observe intense, short duration emissions of high energy photons, known as gamma-ray bursts, from      astronomical sources. With the long baseline from Earth to Venus, correlations with near-Earth observations can provide directional      information with a higher precision than is available from Earth alone. Determinations with accuracies of under one arc minute are      possible.       The experiment comprised two CsI photomultiplier detector units, mounted on opposite sides of the periphery of the instrument platform,      giving a full-sky 4 pi steradian field of view. Each contained a scintillation crystal, 3.8 cm in diameter and 3.2 cm long, phoswiched      within and optically bonded to a 0.5 cm thick shell of Pilot B plastic scintillator used for charged particle suppression. Each was      optically coupled to a photomultiplier tube. They were passively shielded from low energy radiation by a jacket of 0.25 mm lead foil      and the sensor housing. The instrument had a mass of 2.8 kg and used 1.3 W power.       The OGBD could detect photons from 0.1 to 2.0 MeV energy, and obtain coarse spectral information using pulse height analysis. It had five      channels, a full 0.1 to 2.0 MeV channel, and four channels covering 0.1-0.2 MeV, 0.2-0.5 MeV, 0.5-1.0 MeV, and 1.0-2.0 MeV. The normal      accumulation time for the channels was 11.7 ms, a time-to-spill algorithm recorded the total intensity in time bins of 11.7 ms to 0.25 ms,      depending on the count rate.       A temporary pretrigger memory would continuously store 3 seconds of data, if a rapid increase in count rate triggered the internal logic      to begin recording, the 3 seconds of data would be automatically added to the 20 kb buffer. The buffer would continue to record for up to      28 seconds of event data. The detector went into operation on 21 May 1978, one day after launch. It operated continuously until the end of      the PVO mission in October 1992.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:pvo.oims,ION MASS SPECTROMETER (OIMS) for PIONEER VENUS,ION MASS SPECTROMETER (OIMS) for PIONEER VENUS,"       INSTRUMENT OVERVIEW     ===================                     Using the Pioneer Venus Orbiter Ion Mass Spectrometer (OIMS), composition and concentration of thermal positive ions             in the ionosphere of Venus were determined and interpreted in terms of vertical and horizontal components. These provided             information on provided information on the solar wind interaction with Venus, upper atmosphere photochemistry, and the             mass and heat transport characteristics of the atmosphere. The instrument used was a Bennett radio-frequency mass spectrometer             based on the design of those flown on OGO and Atmospheric Explorer satellites. A mass range of 1-56 amu was covered with a             variety of automatic scan-search modes available.                  Identical Ion Mass Spectrometers were mounted on the Pioneer Venus Orbiter and the Probe Bus. Each spectrometer, with a mass              of 3.0 kg, consisted of two parts, an analyzer tube and an electronics package. The electronics package held printed circuit              boards inside a machined magnesium housing mounted inside the spacecraft. The package contained low- and high-gain pre-amplifiers,              amplifiers, a log A/D converter, an RF generator, voltage regulator, command and control, and data handling. It uses 1.5 W of power,              and functions to supply RF and DC potentials to the ion analyzer tube; detect and amplify ion current flowing to the collectors;              digitize, process, and format data for telemetry; configure the sensor for subsequent measurements; and decode and implement commands.                  The analyzer tube is a hollow cylinder of aluminum containing a series of knitted tungsten mesh grids and gold-plated aluminum spacers.              These are backed by a supressor, a low-gain collector and a high-gain collector. At the head of the tube is a guard ring and an              accelerating voltage. The analyzer can be set to measure any of 16 common ion masses from 1 to 56 amu (1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 14, 16, 17,              18, 24, 28, 30, 32, 40, 44, and 56 amu). It also has the ability to produce simulated ion currents for calibration.                  The instrument operated with repeated explore/adapt cycles, each 6.3 seconds in duration. The first 1.8 seconds of the cycle is the              explore portion, which consists of measuring each of the 16 pre-selected masses for approximately 0.1 second each. In the 4.5              second adapt portion of the cycle, up to 8 ions that are found to be present in the explore portion are measured repeatedly. The              ion current values from each measurement are sampled, held for A/D conversion, and transfered to telemetry storage registers.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:pvo.oir,INFRARED RADIOMETER (OIR) FOR PIONEER VENUS,INFRARED RADIOMETER (OIR) FOR PIONEER VENUS,"       INSTRUMENT OVERVIEW     ===================       The Orbiter Infrared Radiometer (OIR) was used for vertical temperature sounding of the atmosphere from the cloud tops (60 km,      250 mb pressure) to roughly 150 km (on the order of 1 to 10 nanobar), and for investigations of cloud morphology, including the      identification of possible multiple layers and water vapor mapping. The instrument was based on the selective chopper radiometer      and the pressure modulator radiometer designs flown on Nimbus satellites. The instrument failed to operate after 72 orbits, on      February 14, 1979.       The OIR is an 8 channel radiometer mounted on the instrument platform on the orbiter bus. It is fixed at an angle of 45 degrees,      boresighted in the same plane as the photopolarimeter and ultraviolet spectrometer, to be able to cover both polar and equatorial      regions of Venus. Channel 1 uses a CO2 pressure-modulation technique to measure temperatures anywhere from about 0.01 mb to the      beginning of the exosphere. Channels 2 through 5 covered wavelengths near the absorption band of carbon dioxide at 15 microns.      Channel 6 was centered at the 2 micron carbon dioxide band to study cloud structure. Channel 7 was a wide-band (0.2 to 4.5 microns)      to measure total reflected solar intensity. Channel 8 was centered at 40 to 50 microns, the strongest part of the pure rotational      band of water, to map the distribution of water vapor in the upper atmosphere. OIR is 24.8 x 17.5 x 25.1 cm in size with a mass of      5.9 kg, and uses 5.2 W power.       The infrared light enters the instrument through a 48 mm aperture off-axis parabolic telescope. The 1.25 degree field of view      translates to a resolution of a few km near periapsis (the FOV is 5 degrees for channel 1). The nominal sample, or dwell, time      is 30 ms to reduce smearing by the spacecraft rotation. Temperature sensitivity is better than 0.5 K at 240 K. When the atmosphere      is being viewed tangentially at the limb during a limb crossing, the dwell time is reduced to 12 ms for about 150 ms.       The instrument operated for 72 orbits, returning about 800,000 vertical profiles of upper atmospheric temperature. It failed on      14 February 1979.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:pvo.omag,FLUXGATE MAGNETOMETER (OMAG) for PIONEER VENUS,FLUXGATE MAGNETOMETER (OMAG) for PIONEER VENUS,"    INSTRUMENT OVERVIEW  ===================           This experiment used a triaxial fluxgate magnetometer with two ring-core sensors at the end of a magnetometer boom          and one ring-core sensor, at 45 degrees to the spin axis, partway down the boom. The drive and electronics design had          been used on the Apollo 15 and 16 subsatellites. The objectives of this investigation were to: (1) determine any          planetary and remnant magnetic fields; (2) deduce the location and strength of the ionospheric current system; (3)          determine the energy and mass balance in the upper atmosphere of Venus; (4) examine the nature of the solar wind          interaction with Venus; and, (5) study the near-wake region of Venus and the structure of the Venusian bow shock.          Additional objectives for interplanetary (solar wind) studies were to determine the perturbation of the near-planet          region by Venus and to compare the properties of the average field at 0.7 and 1.0 AU.           The magnetometer consists of three basic units, the electronics unit mounted inside the main spacecraft bus, an inboard          sensor assembly mounted about one-third of the way from the end of a 4.7 meter boom, and an outboard assembly mounted on          the end of the boom. The electronics box is magnesium, 15 x 22 x 15 cm in size, and has a mass of 1,7 kg. It includes a          12-bit analog to digital converter. the inboard sensor is 6 x 7 x 6 cm, with a mass of 110 g. It holds a single magnetometer          oriented at 45 degrees to the orbiter spin axis. The outboard sensor is 8 x 5 x 4.5 cm, with a mass of 170 g. It comprises          two magnetometers, one parallel to the spin axis and one perpendicular. Total mass including wiring is 2 kg, and the system          uses 2.2 W at 27 V DC.           The magnetometers are triaxial fluxgate type with large loop gain and feedback. The core of the magnetometer is a ring          wrapped with permeable metal. The core is surrounded by drive, sense, and feedback coils. A sinusoidal drive voltage with          a 7.25 kHz frequency is used, 4 V peak-to-peak and 150 mA. The sense circuit detects the second harmonic of the drive          frequency, which is a function of the external magnetic field along the sense axis of the magnetometer ring core. The feedback          circuit acts to conceal the field and the output is the measured input to the feedback circuit required to cancel the field.          The range of the instrument is 128 gamma, which remains constant, but the resolution can change from 1/16 gamma to 1/2 gamma.          The sampling rate can vary by more than two orders of magnitude. The signals flow to the data handling assembly, where it is          digitized to 12 bits for each of the three sensors. The 36 bits are compressed to a single 32 bit word by conversion to floating          point words.           The instrument was intended to, in the worst case of low-bit and low-sample rates, measure one vector per 32 s. While in Venus          orbit, when the spacecraft was coasting through the interplanetary region in the apoapsis mode, the sample rate was one vector          per 8 s. While the spacecraft was passing through Venus' ionosphere in the periapsis mode, the sample rate was four vectors per          second.           The last full orbit of three-axis data was 3602, which ended on 16 Oct. 1988 at 14:30 UT. After this time, only one-axis data          were available.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:pvo.onms,ORBITER NEUTRAL MASS SPECTROMETER (ONMS) for PIONEER VENUS,ORBITER NEUTRAL MASS SPECTROMETER (ONMS) for PIONEER VENUS,"         INSTRUMENT OVERVIEW     ===================         The Neutral Mass Spectrometer (ONMS) had the primary objective of measuring the number densities of neutral atoms and          molecules in the upper atmosphere of Venus, from perigee near 150 km to about 500 km, to help define its chemical,          dynamical, and thermal state. Combined with lower atmospheric neutral mass data from the large probe and bus probe, it          would also help determine the profile of atmospheric mixing. The instrument was housed in a 4.5 cm diameter tube, 16 cm          long, with a small cylinder attached perpendicularly holding a getter pump, all held inside a shielded cylindrical          electronic support structure inside the orbiter bus. One end of the tube was mounted against the exterior wall of the bus,          connected to a cylindrical chamber mounted on the outside to hold the orifice and ion source.              The experiment used a quadrupole mass spectrometer with three ion-source operating modes and three mass-scanning modes.          A knife-edged orifice, located on the instrument platform of the orbiter 27 degrees from the spin axis, allows gas into a          chamber holding the ion source. The ion source could be operated alternately in open and closed configurations to increase          accuracy. In open source mode, only free-streaming particles, with large kinetic energies due to the relative velocity of          the orbiter (~10 km/s at periapsis), are measured. Open source mode is used to measure noble and non-reactive gases. In the          closed source mode all the particles measured are surface-reflected particles, basically inflowing gas stagnated in the          source chamber. This mode is used for measurement of chemically active gases. There was also a ""flip-flop"" mode,          alternating between the modes.              The quadrupole analyzer consisted of 7.5 cm long rods with a field radius of 0.2 cm. Gas atoms and molecules were ionized          and separated by the quadrupole filter according to their mass, using stepping of applied AC and DC voltages. Ions exiting          the analyzer were deflected into the a secondary electron multiplier for charge conversion and amplification. A pulse detector          counted the pulses, and an electrometer amplifier measured the current. These are proportional to the particle density.              An adaptive mass scan was used to reduce the bit rate required for a given information-return rate. The resolution was 0.0001          for adjacent masses, and the mass range was 1 to 46 amu. It could scan continuously through the entire mass range or to scan          any combination of 8 masses within that range. The kinetic energy of the ionizing electrons could be chosen to be 70 or 27 eV          to allow discrimination of constituents of equal mass. The maximum average vertical spacing of the sample points was approximately          400 m at 500 km altitude an horizontal spacing along the orbital path was 2 km. Sampling was either equally spaced in time over          a spin period or restricted to 45 degrees around the ram position.              Approximately two days after orbit insertion, a metal-ceramic breakoff caps was removed by activation of a pyrotechnic device          to expose the ONMS. Vertical and horizontal density variations of the major neutral constituents of the upper atmosphere of          Venus were detected and measured to define the dynamic, chemical, and thermal states of the upper atmosphere. Important constituents          measured were He, O, O2, CO, CO2 and/or N2, and A. It was also possible to study H, D and/or H2, C, and NO.

The objectives were to measure solar wind conditions         (velocity, density, flow direction, and temperature) outside the Venusian bow shock, inside the magnetosheath flow field,         and to study the ionopausal structure. Solar-wind measurements were made during the transit to Venus, particularly to study         macroscale problems and to determine average gradients. The near-planet wake region was also available for study. The instrument         had a mass of 3.9 kg and used 5 W power.          The analyzer was a nested pair of plates, each with the shape of one-quarter of a sphere with a radius of 12 cm, held 1 cm apart.         On one side, perpendicular to the plates, is an entrance aperture to allow ions, protons and electrons to pass between the two plates,         at the other, exit, end is an array of five current collectors. The plates are charged so that a charged particle travelling between         the plates is deflected into a curved path and, depending on the particle, the initial direction of travel, and the strength of the         field, can strike one of the five detectors after passing through a drift tube grid and a suppressor grid. Each detector has its own         electrometer amplifier. The voltage between the plates can be varied in a stepwise fashion from 50 V to 8000 V in 32 logarithmically         equal steps for high-energy positive ions, and 15 steps from 3 V to 250 V, plus a step at 0.25 V, for electrons and low-energy positive         ions, to cover a large range of particle energy/charge.          The energy/charge range was 50-8000 (ions) in 32 steps and 1-500 (electrons) in 16 steps. The angular range covered was +/-85 degrees         elevation by 360 degrees azimuth, and the detector field of view was 15 deg by 25 deg or 15 deg by 45 deg, depending on position. The         logic design was essentially that used on Pioneers 8 and 9. The instrument had two modes of operation, command-able from Earth. The         scan mode finds the peak particle flux over one revolution of the spacecraft for each voltage step and identifies the spacecraft         azimuth and collector that measures the maximum flux at each voltage. Then a polar scan and an azimuthal scan are made at four         consecutive voltage steps, beginning with the step before the one at which the maximum flux was measured. Each polar scan measures the         flux at each collector, while each azimuth scan measures the flux in 12 sectors centered on the peak flux direction. The step mode         allocates about one second to each voltage step, for only the maximum flux scan.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:pvo.orad,SURFACE RADAR MAPPER (ORAD) for PIONEER VENUS,SURFACE RADAR MAPPER (ORAD) for PIONEER VENUS,"                 INSTRUMENT OVERVIEW    ===================          The Pioneer Venus Orbiter radar altimeter (ORAD) was used to obtain information on the orbiter altitude,          planetary surface temperature, and radar scattering properties in order to infer the surface topography,          geology, and the thermal and mechanical properties of the interior of Venus. From observations of the radar          echo, surface heights along the suborbital trajectory can be estimated to an accuracy of 150 m. Surface          lectrical conductivity and meter-scale roughness can also be derived.          The ORAD consists of a 38 cm diameter short backfire reflector antenna with a single axis positioning motor          and an electronics box. The antenna is mounted on the periphery of the orbiter equipment shelf. The motor          allows the antenna to be moved in a plane containing the spacecraft's spin axis. The antenna beams a low          power (20 W peak pulse power), S-band (1.757 GHz), 30 degree beamwidth pulse to the surface, and the echoes          are recieved and processed on-board. The instrument had a mass of 9.7 kg and used 18 W power.          The measurements were made whenever the spacecraft was below 4700 km. The antenna is mechanically moved in a          plane containing the spacecrafts spin axis to view the suborbital point on the planet's surface once during          each roll of the spacecraft. Relatively long pulses are used to obtain a good signal-to-noise ratio from each          pulse. The transmitted pulses are modulated, and the specifics of the pulse used depend on altitude.          From periapsis to 700 km, a 55 baud (sub-pulse) code with a duration of 4 microseconds and a pulse repetition          frequency (PRF) of 189.4 Hz is used. From 700 to 1515 km, the PRF is lowered to 92.8 Kz. From 1515 to 2575 km,          a baud duration of 6 microseconds and a PRF of 108.2 Hz is used. From 2575 to 3000 the PRF is increased to 189.4 Hz.          There were four types of measurements made by ORAD during each 12 second spacecraft revolution. Four along          track altimetry measurements in four Doppler bands made below 700 km altitude. (Above 700 km there is one nadir          measurement per spacecraft roll.) The radar observations occupy about 1 sec out of each 12 second spacecraft          rotation period. A radiometric measurement (17 cm brightness temperature) was made with the antenna pointing          towards nadir. One or two side looking imaging measurements were made with the antenna pointed to either side          of the spacecraft nadir. A radiometer calibration measurement was made with the antenna pointing towards zenith          (cold space). The surface resolution at periapsis is 23 km along track and 7 km across track.          Each roll acquires 640 bits of data. The altimeter measurements were processed on board into profiles of echo          power versus time delay. Each altimetry measurement yielded values of range, RMS surface slope, and Fresnel          reflectivity. Each 12 second spacecraft revolution yielded one or two maps of radar backscatter, each resolved          into 64 pixels. ORAD made measurements of the Venus surface from 5 December 1978 through 23 March 1981.

It was an adaptation of the instrument          flown on the German Aeros satellite in 1972. Either one of two sensor heads could be used, each consisting of a multigrid          cup and electrometer, which could operate in electron, ion, or photoelectron modes, initiated by spacecraft roll pulses.          The aims of the investigation were to improve knowledge of the important ionic reactions in the Venusian ionosphere, to          study the plasma transport processes to determine if Venus has a polar wind, to study the processes at the solar          wind-ionosphere boundary, and to study similar aims concerning the ambient electron population. Although the instrument          was designed to detect low-energy plasma particles in the ionosphere, it could also make measurements of the interaction          between the ionosphere and solar wind at altitudes up to 500 km. The instrument had a mass of 2.8 kg and used 2.4 W power.               The ORPA axis is offset from the spacecraft spin axis so the ORPA axis could be close in alignment to the spacecraft velocity          vector near periapsis. Large entrance grids and a collector guard ring provide a uniform flux radially from the instrument axis,          the uniform central region of the flux is sampled by the collectors. A 30 cm diameter ground plane surrounds the entrance grid.          The instrument used multiple collector grids coated with colloidal graphite to selectively funnel various ionospheric particles to          strike a detector. The grids were 6 cm in diameter spaced over 1.6 cm, and included an entrance grid, ion suppressor grid, ion          retarding grid, displacement current shield, electron suppressor grid, and a collector connected to an electrometer which amplified          the current induced in the detector. The grids could be set with varying electric potentials, or control voltages, depending on the          mode of operation and the quantity being measured.               The instrument could operate in three modes: Langmuir probe mode, ion mode, or photoelectron mode. Langmuir probe mode had a linear          electron coarse scan of 64 steps of roughly 0.2 volts/step, covering -4.8 to 7.8 V. It also had a linear electron fine scan of 20          steps of 0.05 V subdividing 5 of the coarse steps. Ion mode used 80 quadratic steps over -0.5 to 39 V referenced to the plasma potential.          The photoelectron mode had 25 quadratic steps covering 0 to -60 V.               Scans were made at roughly 120 km (~12 sec) intervals while the orbital path was within the ionosphere, allowing for approximately          50 measurements below the ionopause on the dayside. Each scan took a small fraction of the spin period, (0.04 to 0.16 seconds),          with on-board computing determining which scan to transmit based on being taken at the optimal point in the spacecraft's rotation          when the sensor axis was closest to the plasma flow velocity vector (peak select). It also had an I-V mode were every other current          value in the electron mode and in the ion mode were stored for transmission every third spacecraft rotation.               Concentrations (from 100 - 10,000,000 per cubic cm), temperatures (300 - 10,000 K), and masses (1-56 AMU) of the four most abundant          ions were measured every 12 seconds for 0.16 seconds per measurement. Ion drift velocity (from 0.05 to 5 km/s) were measured for 0.16          seconds or 24 seconds every 50 seconds. The low-energy electron distribution function (0-60 eV) was measured for 0.05 seconds every          12 seconds, and electron temperature (300-20,000 K) was measured for 0.04 seconds every 0.04 or 12 seconds. Vector ion velocity was          measured by recording three scans with the instrument pointing to three different directions in three successive spin cycles. A special          mode of operation allowed total ion concentration to be measured over a 1 meter sampling distance at a spacecraft velocity of 10 km/sec,          at 20 m intervals.

These measurements are used to establish and map the composition, temperature, and        photochemistry of the thermosphere and ionosphere, to determine the pressure at and above the visible cloud tops, and        to establish the distribution and escape rate of atomic hydrogen.         The OUVS used a 250 mm Cassegrain telescope on a 125 mm focal length Ebert-Fastie monochromator with a programmable        grating drive. The instrument operated in the 1100-3400 A region. The telescope had a lightshade assembly and a 5 cm        aperture. It had a 1.83 x 0.16 degree field of view, 60 degrees from the spin axis. and focused the incoming light        onto the monochromator. The Ebert-Fastie monochromator had a 3600 line/mm diffraction grating, with 15 Angstrom        spectral resolution and 4.4 angstrom grating steps. The grating is driven by a commandable step motor, which can        select a desired wavelength, and has a scan mode, or can be set in one of 512 positions. It had two exit slits, which        passed the dispersed light to two photomultiplier tubes, to convert the light into electrical impulses. One tube had        a cesium iodide cathode with a lithium fluoride window, and was sensitive to UV wavelengths from 1100 to 1900 Angstroms.        The other tube had a cesium telluride cathode and silicon dioxide window, and covered wavelengths from 1900 to 3600        angstroms. Counting could be done up to 2 Hz, it could store up to 256 words of data, and an integration period of 4, 8,        16, or 32 ms, determined by ground command. The instrument had a mass of 3.1 kg and required 1.7 W power.         The instrument had three primary modes of operation. In spectral mode, the entire spectrum is scanned in four 256-word        sections. Each section is scanned in 1 second, stored, and read out to the telemetry stream over one or more spacecraft        spins. In wavelength mode, the grating position, and thus the wavelength, is selected by ground command. An approximately        30 degree arc of data is collected in this mode for each spacecraft spin. This mode is used for mapping and imaging. In        Lyman-Alpha mode, individual measurements at a fixed wavelength are made on command. In a typical orbit, the OUVS makes        measurements from 150 to 35 minutes prior to periapsis, to make airglow measurements and do cloud imaging. It makes observations        again starting 15 minutes before periapsis until 10 minutes after to study limb airglow profiles and limb hazes. Spectra are        recorded at periapsis. It can observe bright, hot starts for calibration and Lyman-alpha throughout the rest of the orbit.

Duration of Nominal Operational Period   From 300 minutes before to 300 minutes after closest approach to Titan for prime operation.     Team Leader   The Team Leader for the RADAR instrument is Dr. Charles Elachi.     Instrument Modes   The Cassini Radar (RADAR) will be used to investigate the surface of Saturn's moon Titan by taking four types of observations:  imaging, altimetry, backscatter, and radiometry.  In the imaging mode of operation, the RADAR instrument will bounce pulses of microwave energy off the surface of Titan from different incidence angles and record the time it takes the pulses to return to the spacecraft.  These measurements, when converted to distances (by dividing by the speed of light), will allow the construction of visual images of the target surface.  Radar will be used to image Titan because the moon's surface is hidden from optical view by a thick, cloud-infested atmosphere: radar can 'see' through such cloud cover.   Radar altimetry similarly involves bouncing microwave pulses off the surface of the target body and measuring the time it takes the 'echo' to return to the spacecraft.  In this case, however, the goal will not be to create visual images but rather to obtain numerical data on the precise altitude of the surface features of Titan.  In the backscatter mode of operation, the RADAR will act as a scatterometer.  That is, it will bounce pulses off Titan's surface and then measure the intensity of the energy returning.  This returning energy or backscatter, is always less than the original pulse, because surface features inevitably reflect the pulse in more than one direction.  From the backscatter measurements, scientists can infer the composition of the surface of Titan.   Finally, in the radiometry mode, the RADAR will operate as a passive instrument, simply recording the energy emanating from the surface of Titan.  This information will tell scientists the amount of latent heat (i.e., moisture) in the moon's atmosphere, a factor that has an impact on the precision of the other measurements taken by the instrument.   During imaging, altimetry, and backscatter operations, the RADAR instrument will transmit linear frequency-modulated Ku-band pulsed signals toward the surface of Titan using the high-gain antenna (HGA).  These signals, after reflection from the surface, will be captured by the same antenna and detected by the RADAR Radio Frequency Electronics Subsystem.  During radiometry operations, the instrument will not transmit any radar signals, but the HGA will again be used for radiometric observations.   To improve the surface coverage by radar imaging, a switched, multiple Ku-band antenna feed array structure is part of the HGA and permits the formation of five antenna beam patterns.  Each of these beams will have a different pointing angle relative to the antenna reflector's focal axis.   The major functional components of the RADAR Subsystem are the Radio Frequency Electronics Subsystem, the Digital Subsystem, and the Energy Storage Subsystem.     Radio Frequency Electronics Subsystem (RFES)   The Radio Frequency Electronics Subsystem (RFES) has three principal functions: the transmission of high-power frequency-modulated and unmodulated pulses, the reception of both reflected energy from the target and passive radiometric data, and the routing of calibration signals.  The RFES has a fully enclosed structural housing and Faraday cage (i.e., an electrostatic shield).  The RFES electronics units are individually enclosed and are mounted to the RFES housing wall opposite the wall that mounts to the spacecraft.  For thermal control, heat flows conductively from the units to the housing wall and is then radiated away from the RFES.   The RFES consists of the following components: a frequency generator, a digital chirp generator, a chirp up-converter and amplifier, a high-power amplifier, front-end electronics, a microwave receiver unit, and an RFES power supply.   * The frequency generator (FG) contains an ultra-stable oscillator that   is the system timing source for the RADAR instrument.   * The digital chirp generator (DCG) generates the low-power, baseband   frequency, modulated pulse upon request from the RADAR Digital   Subsystem.  Both the bandwidth and the pulse width of this pulse can   be varied in accordance with the parameters received from the Digital   Subsystem.   * The chirp up-converter and amplifier (CUCA) converts the baseband chirp   pulse to Ku band and provides the up-converted pulse to the high-power   amplifier.   * The high-power amplifier (HPA) receives a low-power Ku-band chirp pulse   from the CUCA and amplifies that pulse to the required power level for   transmission.   * The purpose of the front-end electronics (FEE) is to route the   high-power transmission pulses, the returning low-energy echoes and   radiometric signals, and the calibration signals.  The FEE receives   the high-power pulse from the HPA and routes the signal to one of five   different antenna ports on the RFES via an antenna switch module.  The   echo returns and radiometric signals are routed from one of the five   antenna ports to the RFES microwave receiver.  The FEE also steers the   selected calibration signal to the microwave receiver during periods of   calibration mode operation.   * The microwave receiver (MR) receives signals at Ku band and   down-converts these to baseband so that they can be properly sampled.   The sources of these signals are the echo returns, radiometric signals,   and calibration signals routed through the FEE.  The MR receives the   re-routed chirp calibration signal from the CUCA and passes that signal   to the FEE for proper routing.  The MR is also the source of the noise   diode calibration signal that is provided to the FEE for routing.  MR   gain and bandwidth information is provided to the MR from the DSS.   * The RFES power supply converts the (approximately) 30-volt d.c. input   from the Power and Pyrotechnic Subsystem to the required voltages for   the RFES.     Digital Subsystem (DSS)   The RADAR Digital Subsystem (DSS) performs three principal functions: reception and depacketization of RADAR commands from the Command and Data Subsystem (CDS), configuration control and timing signal generation for RADAR, and the packetization of RADAR housekeeping (i.e., hardware status) data and science data for transfer to the CDS.   DSS subassemblies are contained within a spacecraft bay and will be supported in shear by shear plates and the top and bottom rings of the Cassini spacecraft bus.  Electronic harnesses, which face inboard on the spacecraft and be supported by the inboard shear plate, are used to provide interconnections between the RADAR subassemblies and the spacecraft.   The DSS uses two primary modes of heat transfer in its design.  These are (1) the conduction of heat from the electronic components to the subchassis and the outboard shear plate, and (2) the radiation of heat from the outboard shear plate to the space environment.  High-power heat dissipation components are mounted on a special heatsink bracket, which is bolted directly to the outboard shear plate to optimize heat transfer.  Thermal compounds were applied between the components and the heatsink to minimize contact thermal resistance.   The DSS consists of the following components: a bus interface unit, a flight computer unit, a control and timing unit, a signal conditioner unit, and a DSS power supply.   * The bus interface unit (BUI) is the interface between RADAR and the   CDS.  On the RADAR side, the BIU interfaces to the flight computer unit   for command, software, and data transfers.   * The flight computer unit (FCU) receives commands and software   from the CDS and sends data and status to CDS by way of the BIU.   It depacketizes the commands and provides the RADAR configuration and   timing information to the control and timing unit.  It also receives   housekeeping values in a predetermined order from the low-speed A/D   converter and packetizes the housekeeping and science data to be   passed to the CDS by way of the BIU.  In addition, the FCU receives   spacecraft time broadcasts and RADAR software uploads from CDS by way   of the BIU.  The FCU is built around an engineering flight computer   (EFC) with additional banks of ROM and internal interface circuitry.   * The purpose of the control and timing unit (CTU) is to control   the hardware configuration and the timing of control signals   within RADAR.  The parameters for determining RADAR configuration   and timing are passed to the CTU from the FCU.  The CTU provides   the configuration and timing control signals to the RFES and to   other portions of the DSS.  In addition, the CTU is responsible   for updating to millisecond resolution the spacecraft time received   from the CDS.   * The signal conditioner unit (SCU) consists of a science data   buffer and high- and low-speed analog-to-digital (A/D) converters.   The science data buffer (SDB) is the digital data rate buffer for   RADAR.  The sole purpose of the SDB is to receive and store the   high-rate digital science data from the high-speed A/D converter   during the proper receive window period (as determined by the   CTU) and then to provide this data upon request to the FCU at a   slower rate.  The high-speed A/D converter digitizes the imaging   data output from the RFES microwave receiver and provides the data   to the SDB for buffering.  The low-speed A/D converter performs   two tasks.  It digitizes the analog housekeeping telemetry values   from throughout RADAR at predetermined times and provides these   digitized values to the FCU upon request.  It also digitizes the   radiometer output from the RFES microwave receiver and provides   those values to the FCU upon request.   * The DSS power supply converts the (approximately) 30-volt d.c. input   from the Power and Pyrotechnic Subsystem to the voltages required for   the DSS.     Energy Storage Subsystem (ESS)   The RADAR Energy Storage Subsystem (ESS) converts the (approximately) 30-volt d.c. input from the PPS to a higher voltage, stores energy in a capacitor bank, and provides a regulated voltage to the high-power amplifier (HPA) of the RFES.  The ESS subassemblies are contained within a spacecraft bay and are supported in shear by shear plates and the top and bottom rings of the Cassini spacecraft bus. High-strength fasteners will be used to tie the electronics assemblies to the spacecraft.  Electronic harnesses, which face inboard on the spacecraft and be supported by the inboard shear plate, are used to provide interconnections between the RADAR subassemblies and the spacecraft.   The ESS uses two primary modes of heat transfer in its design.  These are (1) the conduction of heat from the electronic components to the subchassis and the outboard shear plate, and (2) the radiation of heat from the outboard shear plate to the space environment.  High-power heat dissipation components will be mounted on a special heatsink bracket, which will be bolted directly to the outboard shear plate to optimize heat transfer.  Thermal compounds will be applied between the components and the heatsink to minimize contact thermal resistance.   The ESS consists of boost circuitry, the capacitor bank, and a buck regulator.   * The boost circuitry increases the (approximately) 30-volt   d.c. input power to approximately 85 volts d.c. for more efficient   energy storage by the capacitor bank.  Soft-start circuitry limits   the current draw from the power source, and an input voltage filter   prevents electromagnetic interference (EMI) from being conducted   back into the source.   * The capacitor bank stores energy to supply to the buck regulator   (and the HPA) during RADAR pulse bursts.  The capacitor bank voltage   drops during each burst but returns to normal before the next burst.   * The buck regulator regulates the varying capacitor bank voltage for   the HPA.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:rems.msl,ROVER ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING STATION for MSL,ROVER ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING STATION,"The Rover Environmental Monitoring Station (REMS) instrument is intended to provide in situ near-surface measurements of air and ground temperatures, wind speed and direction, pressure, humidity and ultraviolet radiation. Its objective is to characterize the Martian climate and to study Mars habitability. Systematic measurement is the main driver for REMS operation. Each hour, every sol, REMS will record 5 minutes of data at 1 Hz for all sensors. This strategy will be implemented based on a high degree of autonomy in REMS operations. The instrument will wake itself up each hour and after recording and storing data, will go to sleep independently of rover operations. REMS will record data whether the rover is awake or not, and both day and night. REMS operation is designed assuming a minimum of three hours of operation each day, primarily constrained by power availability. Since the hourly observations will use a total of two hours of operational time, the third hour can be scheduled as a continuous block, for example. Another option that has been implemented in REMS flight software is a simple algorithm to lengthen some of the regular observations autonomously when an atmospheric event is detected. Depending on resources available during the mission, and the science team wishes, REMS can operate more than three hours per day. REMS instrument is formed by four main subsets: (1) ICU (instrument Control Unit), allowing power conditioning and distribution, analog acquisition and control of some of the sensor, thermal control loops, communications with the Booms and data processing and communications with the RCE. The ICU is composed of three boards: CPU, Analog and a DC/DC Converter. The Analog board also integrates the Pressure Sensor (PS); (2) Ultraviolet Sensor (UV), consisting of 6 photodiodes, each one devoted to a different measurement band; (3) Boom 1, hosting an Air Temperature Sensor (ATS), a Wind Sensor (WS), the Ground Temperature Sensor (GTS) and the front-end ASIC that processes all the received analog inputs from the transducers and sends the data to the ICU via a transmission link. (4) Boom 2, hosting another Air Temperature Sensor, another Wind Sensor, the Humidity Sensor (HS) and other front-end ASIC that also processes all the received analog inputs from the transducers and sends the data to the ICU via a transmission link.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pedersen, The Cassini Radio and Plasma Wave Science     Investigation, Space Sci. Rev., in press, 2002.       Scientific Objectives   =====================     The primary objectives of the Cassini Radio and Plasma Wave     investigation are to study radio emissions, plasma waves, thermal     plasma, and dust in the vicinity of Saturn.       Objectives concerning radio emissions include:         Improve our knowledge of the rotational modulation of Saturn's       radio sources, and hence of Saturn's rotation rate.         Determine the location of the SKR source as a function of       frequency, and investigate the mechanisms involved in generating       the radiation.         Obtain a quantitative evaluation of the anomalies in Saturn's       magnetic field by performing direction-finding measurements of the       SKR source.         Establish if gaseous ejections from the moons Rhea, Dione, and       Tethys are responsible for the low frequency narrow-band radio       emissions.         Determine if SKR is controlled by Dione's orbital position.         Establish the nature of the solar wind-magnetosphere interaction       by using SKR as a remote indicator of magnetospheric processes.         Investigate the relationship between SKR and the occurrence of       spokes and other time dependent phenomena in the rings.         Study the fine structure in the SKR spectrum, and compare with the       fine structure of terrestrial and Jovian radio emissions in order       to understand the origin of this fine structure.       Objectives concerning plasma waves include:         Establish the spectrum and types of plasma waves associated with       gaseous emissions from Titan, the rings, and the icy satellites.         Determine the role of plasma waves in the interaction of Saturn's       magnetospheric plasma (and the solar wind) with the ionosphere of       Titan.         Establish the spectrum and types of plasma waves that exist in the       radiation belt of Saturn.         Determine the wave-particle interactions responsible for the loss       of radiation belt particles.         Establish the spectrum and types of waves that exist in the       magnetotail and polar regions of Saturn's magnetosphere.         Determine if waves driven by field-aligned currents along the       auroral field lines play a significant role in the auroral charged       particle acceleration.         Determine the electron density in the magnetosphere of Saturn,       near the icy moons, and in the ionosphere of Titan.       Objectives concerning lightning include:         Establish the long-term morphology and temporal variability of       lightning in the atmosphere of Saturn.         Determine the spatial and temporal variation of the electron       density in Saturn's ionosphere from the low frequency cutoff and       absorption of lightning signals.         Carry out a definitive search for lightning in Titan's atmosphere       during the numerous close flybys of Titan.         Perform high-resolution studies of the waveform and spectrum of       lightning in the atmosphere of Saturn, and compare with       terrestrial lightning.       Objectives concerning thermal plasma include:         Determine the spatial and temporal distribution of the electron       density and temperature in Titan's ionosphere.         Characterize the escape of thermal plasma from Titan's ionosphere       in the downstream wake region.         Constrain and, when possible, measure the electron density and       temperature in other regions of Saturn's magnetosphere.       Objectives concerning dust include:         Determine the spatial distribution of micron-sized dust particles       through out the Saturnian system.         Measure the mass distribution of the impacting particles from       pulse height analyses of the impact waveforms.         Determine the possible role of charged dust particles as a source       of field-aligned currents.       Calibration   ===========     An extensive series of amplitude calibrations, frequency responses,     phase calibrations, and instrument performance checks were carried     out on the RPWS prior to launch, both before and after integration     on the spacecraft. These tests and calibrations were performed at     room temperature (25 deg C), -20 deg C, and 40 deg C. While there are     calibration signals available in the instrument for in-flight     calibration purposes, these are mainly used to check for drifts due     to aging or radiation exposure. The primary calibration information     to derive physical units (spectral density, etc.) is derived from     the prelaunch tests.       Operational Considerations   ==========================     The different types of receivers used to cover the spectral and     temporal range covered by the RPWS does not lend itself to a     monolithic, synchronous mode of operation. Nevertheless, to reduce     the magnitude of the in-flight operations to an acceptable level     requires that many of the measurements be scheduled in a systematic     way. The approach is to attempt to acquire survey information in the     form of uniform spectral and temporal observations at a low enough     data rate, ~1 kbps, to ensure that such coverage is available for     the entire Saturnian tour and for a large portion of the cruise and     approach to Saturn. The survey data set will support spatial     mapping, statistical studies, and studies of dynamical effects in     the magnetosphere and their possible correlation with solar wind     variations. In addition to the survey information, special     observations will be added (sometimes at greatly increased data     rates) at specific locations or times to provide enhanced     information required by several of the science objectives. The     special observations may include full polarization and     direction-finding capability or high spectral or temporal resolution     observations by the high frequency receiver, wideband measurements     at one of the possible bandwidths, acquisition of delta-ne/ne     measurements, or intensive wave-normal analysis afforded by     acquiring five-channel waveforms on an accelerated schedule. While     minimizing the number of different modes in which the instrument is     operated both simplifies operations and yields a more manageable     data set, flexibility (for example in the duty cycle of wideband     measurements) increases the likelihood that enhanced measurements     can be integrated successfully with the resource requirements of the     other instruments. One of the resources which will be most limited     on Cassini is the overall data volume; RPWS requires large data     volumes for some of its measurements.       Detectors   =========     The RPWS utilizes three 10-m electric antennas, three magnetic     antennas, and a Langmuir probe for detectors.  Three monopole     electric field antennas, labeled Eu, Ev, and Ew, are used to provide     electric field signals to the various receivers. The physical     orientations of these three antennas relative to the x, y, and z     axes of the spacecraft are given below. However, the electrical     orientations of these are strongly affected by the asymmetric nature     of the ground plane of the spacecraft chassis.  These electrical     orientations are incorporated into the calibrations, primarily of     the High Frequency Receiver.  By electronically taking the     difference between the voltages on the Eu and Ev monopoles, these     two antennas can be used as a dipole, Ex, aligned along the x axis     of the spacecraft.       Physical orientations of the electric monopole antennas:     Antenna    theta (degrees) phi (degrees)         Eu        107.5           24.8         Ev        107.5          155.2         Ew         37.0           90.0       The angle theta is the polar angle measured from the spacecraft +z     axis.  The angle phi is the azimuthal angle, measured from the     spacecraft +x axis.       The tri-axial search coil magnetic antennas, labeled Bx, By, and Bz,     are used to detect three orthogonal magnetic components of     electromagnetic waves. The search coil axes are aligned along the x,     y, and z axes of the spacecraft.       The spherical Langmuir probe is used for electron density and     temperature measurements.  This is extended from the spacecraft in     approximately the -x direction, in spacecraft coordinates.       Electronics   ===========     The electronics consists of five receivers. These receivers are     connected to the antennas described above by a network of switches.     The high frequency receiver (HFR) provides simultaneous auto- and     cross-correlation measurements from two selected antennas over a     frequency range from 3.5 kHz and 16 MHz. By switching the two inputs     of this receiver between the three monopole electric antennas, this     receiver can provide direction-of-arrival measurements, plus a full     determination of the four Stokes parameters. The high frequency     receiver includes a processor that performs all of its digital     signal processing, including data compression. The high frequency     receiver also includes a sounder transmitter that can be used to     transmit short square wave pulses from 3.6 to 115.2 kHz. When used     in conjunction with the high frequency receiver, the sounder can     stimulate resonances in the plasma, most notably at the electron     plasma frequency, thereby providing a direct measurement of the     electron number density.  The medium frequency receiver (MFR)     provides intensity measurements from a single selected antenna over     a frequency range from 24 Hz to 12 kHz. This receiver is usually     operated in a mode that toggles every 32 seconds between the Ex     electric dipole antenna and the Bx magnetic search coil, thereby     providing spectral information for both the electric and magnetic     components of plasma waves. The low frequency receiver (LFR)     provides intensity measurements from 1 Hz to 26 Hz, typically from     the Ex electric dipole antenna and the Bx magnetic antenna. The     five-channel waveform receiver (WFR) collects simultaneous waveforms     from up to five sensors for short intervals in one of two frequency     bands, either 1 to 26 Hz, or 3 Hz to 2.5 kHz. When connected to two     electric and three magnetic antennas, this receiver provides wave     normal measurements of electromagnetic plasma waves. The wideband     receiver is designed to provide nearly continuous wideband waveform     measurements over a bandwidth of either 60 Hz to 10.5 kHz, or 800 Hz     to 75 kHz. These waveforms can be analyzed on the ground in either     the temporal domain, or in the frequency domain (Fourier     transformed) to provide high-resolution frequency-time spectrograms.     In a special frequency-conversion mode of operation, the high     frequency receiver can provide waveforms to the wideband receiver in     a 25-kHz bandwidth that is tunable to any frequency between 125 kHz     and 16 MHz.       The Langmuir probe controller is used to sweep the bias voltage of     the probe over a range from -32 to +32 V in order to obtain the     current-voltage characteristics of the probe, and thereby the     electron density and temperature. The controller can also set the     bias voltage on the Eu and Ev monopoles over a range from -10 to +10     V in order to operate them in a current collection mode for     delta-ne/ne measurements.       The RPWS data processing unit consists of three processors. The     first processor, called the low-rate processor, controls all     instrument functions, collects data from the high frequency     receiver, the medium frequency receiver, the low frequency receiver,     and the Langmuir probe, and carries out all communications with the     spacecraft Command and Data System (CDS). The second processor,     called the highrate processor, handles data from the wideband and     five-channel waveform receivers and passes the data along to the     low-rate processor for transmission to the CDS. The third processor,     called the data compression processor, is primarily used for data     compression, but can also perform specialized operations such as     on-board dust detection by using waveforms from the wideband     receiver.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:rss.co,Radio Science Subsystem for Cassini Orbiter,Radio Science Subsystem,"              The Cassini Radio Science instrument included elements on both the spacecraft              and the ground. The spacecraft element (covered by this context product) was               further distributed among several subsystems on the Orbiter, while the ground               element included NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) complexes in California,               Australia, and Spain and occasional support from other ground stations such               as antennas of the European Space Agency tracking network.                The Radio Science 'instrument' operated in two fundamental modes. For 'two-way'               measurements, the 'uplink' signal from the ground could be a single carrier               at either X-band (7.2 GHz) or Ka-band (34 GHz); or both carriers could be               transmitted at the same time.  The spacecraft radio equipment then acted as a              repeater, collecting the carrier signal with the spacecraft High Gain Antenna               (HGA) and transforming it to one or more 'downlink' frequencies (2.3 GHz, 8.4 GHz,               or 32 GHz) by elements in the Radio Frequency Subsystem (RFS) and Radio Frequency              Instrument Subsystem (RFIS). For 'one-way' measurements, the signal source was               on board the Cassini Orbiter; the output from an Ultrastable Oscillator (USO) was               transformed to downlinks at 2.3, 8.4, or 32 GHz.                               The downlink signals were amplified and radiated through the HGA toward Earth.              After passing through the medium of interest (e.g., plasma, rings, a neutral               atmosphere or gravitationally curved space), the perturbed signal was collected                by a ground antenna, amplified, down-converted, and recorded for later analysis.

The signal is immediately re-transmitted (there is a multiplication by 240/221 to prevent feedback into the spacecraft receiver loop) and then received at earth, where it is differenced with the originally transmitted signal. The difference in frequency (the Doppler shift) can be measured to less than 0.01 Hz S band (about 0.65 mm/s) for a 5-second averaging time.  However, there are error sources which frequently degrade this accuracy.  Such things as the earth's troposphere and ionosphere, the Venus atmosphere, and space plasma cause the data noise level to increase by several factors.  The noise levels were very dynamic and changed significantly from day to day.  In some cases where solar conjunction was approaching, the noise increased by a factor of 10 or more and made the data unusable.  The data are displayed as residuals which were obtained by differencing the raw observation with the theoretical calculation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The orbiter tracking data, obtained from the two-way, orbiter-earth S-band and X-band radio links, consist of Doppler frequencies and time-of-flight range measurements. These determined the position and motion of the orbiters, and can be used to study the Mars gravitational field, the plasma in interplanetary space, and the structure of the solar corona when the spacecraft was on the opposite side of the sun. The occultation data were obtained from these same radio links by analog recording of the signal when a spacecraft was passing into or out of occultation with Mars. The data can be used to produce altitude profiles of the temperature, density, and pressure of the atmosphere (including the ionosphere) and to measure the radius of the planet using a large number of surface points. The surface properties aspect of this investigation utilized the UHF (381 MHz) signal on which the landers transmitted data to the orbiters. At the beginning or end of a data transmission session, when the orbiter was near the lander's horizon, the strength of the received signal was recorded as a function of time. These signal ""fading patterns,"" resulting from interaction of the radio waves with the Martian surface, contain information about the physical properties of the surface near the landers.

The table below summarizes the instrument's       sensitivity, resolution, bit rate, and sampling       rate.  The dynamic range and conversion output will       be selected by ground command.         During the initial period of the mission, when the       telemetry signals are strong enough, the       high-bit-rate data will be used for the study of       the ULF hydromagnetic waves.  The low-bit-rate data       will be used while the spacecraft is closer to       Comet Halley to study the macroscopic structure of       the helio-magnetosphere and the cometary       magnetosphere.   _______________________________________________________________________ Table.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:sakig.sow,SOLAR-WIND INSTRUMENT for SAKIG,SOLAR-WIND INSTRUMENT,"         Instrument Overview     ===================       The Solar-Wind Instrument on MS-T5 employs a       Faraday cup to measure the bulk velocity, density       and temperature of solar-wind ions.  This       conventional cup, mounted flush with the outer skin       of the spacecraft, consists of four grids and\ an       ion collector.  The front grid G(1), is connected       to the satellite skin.  A square-wave voltage is       applied to the modulator grid G(2), alternating at       400 Hz between 0 and V volt.  This produces a       pulsating current by repelling and transmitting       those incoming particles whose energy is between 0       and a maximum voltage V of 1.5 kV, which can be       selected from the ground.  The voltage will be       fixed for most of the mission, although the       instrument has several operating modes, such as       automatic voltage change for every spin, automatic       fine voltage sweep between two voltages, etc.  The       third grid is grounded to block any leakage of       modulating voltage from G(2) to the collector.  The       fourth grid is negatively biased at - 100 V to       suppress photo-electrons from the collector.  The       sensor is not sensitive to the solar-wind stream       beyond an angle of attack of +/- 60deg.  The table       below summarizes the sensor's characteristics.       Both DC and AC collector currents are detected.       The former (ion current and secondary-electron       current), which vary during each satellite spin,       are used to check the angular characteristic of the       Faraday cup itself and to monitor the       photo-electron contribution to the collector       current.  The modulated ion current measured       between 2x10**-12 A and 10**-8 A is sampled at 128       points between - 90deg and +90deg with respect to       the solar-wind direction, i.e.  every       180deg/128=1.4deg the collector Current is sampled       as a function of the spin angle.  The bulk velocity       and ion density are calculated from the point where       the slope of the collector-current versus spin       angle function becomes a maximum.   ______________________________________________ Table:  Characteristics of MS-T5 Solar-Wind Instrument   Transmission of the grids   G(1) G(2), G(4) : 90%                             G(3)          : 77%                             Overall      : 70%   Distance between grids      4 mm Collector diameter         90 mm Maximum voltage to be applied to G(2)             1.5 kV +/- 40 V Collector impedance        10 M Ohms (with 20 pF)                            collector-ground                            stray capacity ______________________________________________              ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:sam.msl,SAMPLE ANALYSIS AT MARS for MSL,SAMPLE ANALYSIS AT MARS,"The Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) suite in the MSL Analytical Laboratory is designed to address the present and past habilitability of Mars by exploring molecular and elemental chemistry relevant to life. SAM addresses carbon chemistry through a search for organic compounds, the chemical state of light elements other than carbon, and isotopic tracers of planetary change. SAM is a suite of three instruments: a Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer (QMS), a Gas Chromatograph (GC), and a Tunable Laser Spectrometer (TLS). The QMS and the GC can operate together in a GCMS mode for separation (GC) and definitive identification (QMS) or organic compounds. The mass range of the QMS is 2-535 Da. The TLS obtains precise isotope ratios for C and O in carbon dioxide and H and O in water. It also measures trace levels of methane and its carbon isotope ratio. The three SAM instruments are supported by a sample manipulation system (SMS) and a Chemical Separation and Processing Laboratory (CSPL) that includes high conductance and micro valves, gas manifolds with heaters and temperature monitors, chemical and mechanical pumps, carrier gas reservoirs and regulators, pressure monitors, pyrolysis ovens, and chemical scrubbers and getters. The Mars atmosphere is sampled by CSPL valve and pump manipulations that introduce an appropriate amount of gas through an inlet tube to the SAM instruments. The solid phase materials are sampled by transporting finely-sieved materials to one of 74 SMS sample cups that can then be inserted into a SAM oven and thermally processed for release of volatiles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Micro-FTIR hyperspectral maps of thin sections were acquired using a liquid nitrogen-cooled              HgCdTe (MCT) detector, generating hyperspectral image cubes between 7,000 and 715 cm^-1              (1.4–14.0 μm) at 25 μm/pixel and 8 cm^-1 spectral sampling. Spectra were normalized to 100%              maximum reflectance for ease of comparison. Point spectra were acquired with a deuterated              triglycine sulfate (DTGS) detector, with a spectral range of 400–4,000 cm^-1 (2.5–25 μm).              For these analyses, we chose a spot size of 100 × 100 μm representing a single spot within              the grain, with spectral sampling of 8 cm^-1. Each spectrum represented accumulations of 1,024              scans. For both point spectra and hyperspectral maps, backgrounds were collected on gold mirrors              prior to measuring the sample. Background analyses used the same spot size and acquisition times              as samples.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:sdu.cida,COMETARY AND INTERSTELLAR DUST ANALYZER for SDU,COMETARY AND INTERSTELLAR DUST ANALYZER,"         This catalog file contains excerpts from Kissel et al, 2003.       Refer to this paper for an in-depth description of the       instrument.         SDN:  This document has been updated for the Stardust-NExT (SDN)       mission, but mostly left intact from the prime mission data sets.       The prefix 'SDN:' typically precedes updated material.         Scientific Objectives     =====================       The main objective of CIDA was the analysis of particulates in the       interstellar dust stream and the cometary coma. Important       ancillary data were expected on dust flux rate, particle size       distribution and possibly particle mass densities.         Instrument Overview     ===================       Cometary and Interstellar Dust Analyzer (CIDA) was a space-       qualified time-of-flight mass-spectrometer. Each impacting       particle provided a time-of-flight spectrum that can be       transformed into a mass spectrum once at least two peaks are       found to which well-known atomic mass unit values can be assigned.       CIDA comprised a silver target and single-stage ion reflector,       followed by an open electron multiplier.         The CIDA instrument analyzed the composition of individual       grains. As each particle impacted a silver plate, the high impact       energy due to the relative velocity of the spacecraft as it flies       through the coma caused the elements and molecular compounds in       the particle to become ionized. Using a fast time-of-flight mass       spectrometer, a complete set of ions was detected for each       impact, from a mass range of 1 (atomic hydrogen) up to a few       thousand atomic mass units, encompassing all elements in the       periodic table and many molecules, such as organic compounds.         This diagram illustrates CIDA mounting on the Stardust       spacecraft:                                                      || Dust Collector                                                    ||     Array         Solar Array            Main                ||           Shield       +Z .-.

Normal to                                               CIDA Target Plane        Operational Modes    =================       The on-board data handling system had been optimized for two       separate operation modes: the cruise mode and the encounter mode.       In the cruise mode, the expected event rates were so low that       complete sets of data were easily transferred to ground. In the       encounter mode, to be used during comet flyby, the impact-driven       data rate would essentially saturate the instrument and the       spacecraft's allocated data storage for CIDA of 200 megabits on       STARDUST. Therefore, in this mode the instrument data handling       optimized the size of the data passed to the spacecraft and       attempted to discard all events not obviously containing       meaningful data. In order to check the performance of the       selection process, every 16th triggered event was transmitted       unaltered, regardless of its contents. Every triggering event was       counted, but only a subset of data would be transferred to the       spacecraft and thence to the ground.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:sdu.dfmi,DUST FLUX MONITOR INSTRUMENT for SDU,DUST FLUX MONITOR INSTRUMENT,"         This description was assembled from various Stardust project       documents (with permission from the Stardust project) and       direct contributions from the instrument science lead, Dr.       Anthony J. Tuzzolino.         SDN:  This document has been updated for the Stardust-NExT (SDN)       mission, but mostly left intact from the prime mission data sets.       The prefix 'SDN:' typically precedes updated material.           Instrument Overview       ===================       The Dust Flux Monitor Instrument (DFMI) was part of the STARDUST       instrument payload. It provided data on the particle flux and       mass distribution in the coma of the comet.           Scientific Objectives       =====================       The prime goal of the DFMI was to measure the particle flux and       mass distribution during passage through the coma of Comet Wild-2       in 2004. This information is valuable for assessment of       spacecraft risk and health, and also for interpretation of the       laboratory analysis of dust captured by the Aerogel dust       collectors and returned to Earth.         A secondary science goal was to measure the particle flux and mass       distribution during the ~7 year interplanetary portions of the       mission, where, in addition to measurements of the background       interplanetary dust over the radial range 0.98 AU to 2.7 AU,       multiple opportunities existed for possible detection by the DFMI       of interplanetary particles, meteor-stream particles, and       interstellar dust. This part of the investigation was not achieved       due to problems with the instrument's power supply.         SDN:  For SDN the primary goal was to measure the particle flux and       mass distribution during passage through the coma of Comet 9P/Tempel       1 in 2011.           Calibration       ===========       A description of the calibration of the DFMI sensors is provided       in the calibration report document provided with the DFMI data       set(s).         SDN:  The calibration did not change for Stardust-NExt other than       adjusting for the Tempel 1 flyby speed of 10.9 km/s.  Calibration       comprises converting the electrical threshold levels to the       corresponding particle masses, deriving new thresholds for shield       penetration and effective area for the acoustic sensors, and       converting from the raw counts generated by the electronics vs time       to fluence or flux.           Operational Considerations       ==========================       A problem with the power supply detected during post-launch       checkout precluded operation of the instrument for more than       thirty minutes. Fear of complete failure of the instrument led to       its use being restricted to about thirty minutes at each of the       Annefrank and Wild 2 encounters.         SDN:  With the exception of calibration events during CRUISE       phase, the same was true for the Stardust-NExT mission.           Detectors       =========       The DFMI consisted of two different dust detector systems --  a       polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) DUST SENSOR UNIT (DSU), which       measures particles with mass > ~10^-11 g, and a DUAL ACOUSTIC       SENSOR SYSTEM (DASS), which utilized two quartz piezoelectric       accelerometers mounted on the first two layers of the spacecraft       Whipple dust shield to measure the flux of particles with mass >       3 x 10^-8 g. The Whipple shield structures provided the large       effective sensitive area required for detection of the expected       low flux of high-mass particles. At the encounter speed of 6.1       km/s, the DFMI measurements extended over the particle mass       range of 8 decades, from 10^-11 to >10^-3 g.  More detailed       description of the detectors is provided in Economou et al., 2011,       in Tuzzolino et al., 2003, in Green et al., 2004, and in Tuzzolino,       1994 ([ECONOMOUETAL2011], [TUZZOLINOETAL2003], [GREENETAL2004],       [TUZZOLINO1994]).         SDN:  DFMI comprised four sensor subsystems and associated       electronics:  Two PVDF sensors with sensitive areas of 0.002 and 0.02       m^2 and thicknesses of 6 and 28 um; the Dual Acoustic Sensor       Subsystem (DASS) with two piezoelectric sensor, one attached to each       of the first two layers of the Whipple Shield on the front of the       spacecraft.         Each sensor was designed to generate an electrical signal in the       event of being impacted by a dust particle.         See the Measured Parameters section below for the range of particle       masses detectable by the DFMI detectors at the 9P/Tempel 1 flyby       parameters.           Electronics       ===========       A detailed description of instrument electronics and internal       data processing is provided in Tuzzolino et al., 2003       [TUZZOLINOETAL2003].         SDN:  The electronics for each PVDF sensor comprised four channels       for each sensor.  Each channel corresponded to a particle mass range       dependent on spacecraft/particle relative velocity and the       composition of the particle.  The raw data in each PVDF channel       comprised a cumulative count of the number of events as a function       of time as the spacecraft passed through the coma.  The Acoustic       sensor operation was more complicated due to the limited bandwidth       available to the subsystem, so some interpretation is required to       derive the number of impacts.           Location       ========       The DSU sensor was mounted on the first layer of the central       Whipple shield, as is one of the DASS sensors. The second DASS       sensor was mounted on the second layer of the central Whipple       shield.           Operational Modes       =================       During the Wild 2 encounter DFMI operated in ENCOUNTER mode. In       this mode the instrument provided measurements at least once per       second, and up to 10 times per second, depending on the dust       particle flux on the PVDF sensors.  In this mode the counters were       not reset upon readout, providing accurate cumulative particle       fluences.         SDN:  During the Tempel 1 encounter DFMI operated in ENCOUNTER       mode.  For calibrations during non-encounter phases DFMI operated       in CRUISE mode.  In CRUISE mode the instrument provided measurements       up to ten times per second down to one measurement per twenty       seconds.           Subsystems       ==========       A detailed description of the DFMI subsystems is provided in Economou       et al., 2011, Green et al., 2004, and Tuzzolino et al., 2003       ([ECONOMOUETAL2011], [GREENETAL2004], TUZZOLINOETAL2003]).           Measured Parameters       ===================         The DFMI PDVF sensors measure differential and cumulative particle       fluxes over the particle mass range 10^-11 to 10^-4 g and cumulative       particle fluxes for masses > 10^-4 g. The acoustic sensors measure       particle fluxes for particles having mass greater than 3 x 10^-4 g.         SDN:  At the Stardust(SDU)/Tempel 1 relative velocity of 10.9 km/s,       the mass ranges for differential fluxes were slightly lower but       similar to those for the Wild 2 prime mission.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:sdu.dynsci,DYNAMIC SCIENCE EXPERIMENT for SDU,DYNAMIC SCIENCE EXPERIMENT,"         Instrument Overview       ===================         The instrument used in the Dynamic Science Experiment conducted         during the Stardust spacecraft encounter with comet Wild 2 on         January 2, 2004 was the Stardust spacecraft itself, or more         specifically the spacecraft's Attitude Control System (ACS).         During the encounter ACS provided a significant measure of the         spacecraft's performance and the control system's reaction to         particle impacts.           Throughout the encounter the control system maintained a         three-axis stabilized attitude. The controller also included         the capability to command a roll (about the spacecraft X-axis)         just before closest approach. Using an updated comet trajectory         computed in flight software, the controller commanded a slew to         keep the comet in view of the Navigation Camera. As the comet         passed, the controller commanded a return slew.           The spacecraft commanded two groups of thrusters for control.         Four 1.0 lbf (nominal) thrusters were available for the         bang-bang control and slews. Four 0.2 lbf (nominal) thrusters         were used for limit cycling and small error correction. Four of         each were available as spares. The larger thrusters were         designated TCM thrusters; the smaller, RCS thrusters. RCS         thrusters 1-4 and TCM thrusters 1-4 were used during encounter.         RCS 5-8 and TCM 5-8 were not used.           Scientific Objectives       =====================         The ACS provided data on attitude changes which result from         particle impacts. Analysis of this information could be useful         in diagnosing large particle impact events. For more         information see Anderson et al 2003.

During the comet Wild 2 encounter the spacecraft had its +X         axis pointed to the incoming comet dust stream while keeping         the spacecraft-to-comet vector in spacecraft the XZ plane to         allow tracking of the nucleus by the navigation camera.           Subsystems       ==========         The Stardust ACS subsystem included thrusters, IMU, star         camera, and controlling electronics and software.           Stardust performed attitude control and propulsive maneuvers         using a redundant helium-fed mono-propellant (hydrazine)         propulsion subsystem. This subsystem was comprised of one         titanium propellant tank and a total of 16 thrusters (two         strings of 8), all mounted on the lower deck of the spacecraft         (opposite the high-gain antenna and solar panels - pointing         toward the -Z axis of the spacecraft to avoid potential         contamination of the aerogel collector located on the +Z size         of the spacecraft). Eight of these were 0.2 lbf thrusters and         were used primarily for attitude control. The other eight were         1.0 lbf thrusters and were used for propulsive maneuvers.           Measured Parameters       ===================         The parameters measured during this experiment included         spacecraft orientation and angular rate and times and durations         of ACS thruster firings.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:sdu.navcam,NAVIGATION CAMERA for SDU,NAVIGATION CAMERA,"         The camera state description was provided by the NAVCAM       instrument Science Lead, Raymond L. Newburn, Jr., while the rest of       the description was copied from ``STARDUST Navigation Camera       Instrument Description Document' with permission from the Stardust       project.         SDN:  This document has been updated for the Stardust-NExT (SDN)       mission, but mostly left intact from the prime mission data sets.       The prefix 'SDN:' typically precedes updated material.         Navigation Camera Overview     ==========================         The NAVCAM, an engineering subsystem, was used to optically       navigate the spacecraft upon approach to the comet. This process       allowed the spacecraft to achieve the proper flyby distance, near       enough to the nucleus, to assure adequate dust collection for the       prime mission and the best resolution for the extended mission. The       camera also served as an imaging camera to collect science data. The       data include high-resolution images of the comet nuclei at various       phase angles during approach and departure. These images can be used       to construct a 3-D map of the nucleus in order to better understand       its origin, morphology, and mechanisms, to search for mineralogical       inhomogeneities on the nucleus, and potentially to supply information       on the nucleus rotation state. The camera provided images that give       information on the gas and dust coma during approach and departure       phases of the missions. These images provide information on gas and       dust dynamics, and jet phenomena, if they exist.         In order to meet these science and optical navigation objectives       the NAVCAM design was developed  utilizing a Voyager Wide Angle       Optical Assembly. Additionally, the NAVCAM had a newly-developed       scan mirror mechanism to vary the camera viewing angle and a       periscope to protect the scanning mirror while the spacecraft       flew through the comet coma. The NAVCAM was a framing charge       coupled device (CCD) imager with a focal length of ~200 mm. The       NAVCAM had a focal plane shutter and filter changing mechanism of       the Voyager/Galileo type; the filter changing mechanism may have       failed in flight (see Operational Considerations and Navigation       Camera State History below) and was not used after that point. The       detector was a charge coupled device (CCD), cooled to suppress dark       current and shielded from protons and electrons. The electronics       contained the signal chain and CCD drivers (located in the sensor       head), command and control logic, power supplies, mechanism drivers,       a digital data compressor and two UARTs to interface with the       spacecraft Command and Data Handling (C&DH) subsystem. NAVCAM command       and telemetry functions were also handled by the electronics       including storage of science commands, collection of science imaging       data and telemetry, transmission of imaging data and telemetry to       C&DH and receipt of commands from C&DH. The NAVCAM used a data rate       of 300 kpixels per second for transferring data to the C&DH. There       was also the option for data reduction with 12-bit to 8-bit       square-root compression, and windowing.         Major Functional Elements     =========================         The NAVCAM comprised the following major functional elements       (Newburn, et al., 2003 [NEWBURNETAL2003]):           -  Optics         -  Filter Wheel and Shutter Mechanisms         -  Detector         -  Scan Mirror Mechanism         -  Periscope         -  Electronics and NAVCAM Control           Optics       ------         The optics subassembly inherited its hardware design from, and was         built and tested for, the Voyager Project. It was a Petzval-type         refractor lens with a ~200 mm focal length, f/3.5 and a spectral         range of 380 nm - 1000 nm. The optical components, with the         exception of the filters, were manufactured from LF5G15 and         BK7G14 materials, which are radiation resistant.  A new field         flattener element, located in front of the CCD window, was         designed for Stardust to reduce field curvature and to provide         additional CCD radiation shielding. The optics were supported on         three invar rods that athermalized the system to keep the camera         in focus over the operating temperature range. The optical         barrel assembly mounted to the filter wheel and shutter assembly         utilizing an aluminum truss structure. The housing and truss         were also inherited hardware from Voyager. There was a small         incandescent lamp, spider-mounted in front of the first lens         element, that could be used for in-flight calibrations. Because         radiation resistant optical materials were used to harden the         optics, the lens had poor broad-band modulation transfer function         (MTF) performance (axial color). The theoretical MTF for the         spectral range 380 nm to 1100 nm was 30% at 32 lp/mm.  The         thickness of individual filters was optimized to improve the MTF         over the filter's passbands.           Optics characteristics were:             Focal length            200 mm           Relative aperture       f/3.5           Spectral Range          380 - 1100 nm           Resolution              60 microradian/pixel           Field of view           3.5 x 3.5 deg           Filter Wheel Subassembly       ------------------------         The NAVCAM filter wheel assembly was inherited Flight Spare         hardware from the Voyager Project. The assembly contained an         eight-position filter wheel and a driving mechanism. To actuate         the mechanism a pulse was sent that energizes the linear         solenoid, thereby rotating the rocker arm by means of the         connector rod. The pawl, pivoted on the rocker arm, was driven         toward the next wheel cog. At this point the pawl released         latch A from the cog wheel, extended the drive spring and then         engaged the next cog on the wheel. This put the mechanism in         the cocked position. When the solenoid was de-energized, the         rocker arm and pawl were returned to their original positions by         the drive spring, which advanced the filter wheel one position.         During this travel the A latch followed the pawl inward and was         in position to stop the filter wheel at the end of the stroke.         The back latch B ratcheted over the cogs, preventing the wheel         from back lashing. A series of photo-diodes were uncovered by a         pattern of small apertures in the filter wheel, which were unique         for each filter position. Thus the filter that was in the         optical path was known for each image taken and was included as         part of the engineering telemetry.           The spectral response of the camera was controlled by bandpass         filters. The bandpass filters for Stardust were new and         installed into the filter wheel to replace the Voyager filters.         In this table, the filters are identified along with some of         their characteristics and their position location in the filter         wheel:           (SDN:  as noted elsewhere only the OPNAV filter was ever used         after a failure early in the prime mission.           The /DATA/FILTRANS/ directory of the data set now also contains         NAVCAM Filter Transmission tables, and the confusing Blocking         entries have been removed from the table below.)

Shutter Subassembly       -------------------         The NAVCAM shutter assembly was also inherited Flight Spare         hardware from the Voyager Project. The device was a two-blade         focal plane mechanism. Each blade was actuated by its own         permanent rotary solenoid. The duration of the exposure was         controlled by the time interval between two pulses (an open         pulse and a close pulse). The open pulse powered the 'leading'         blade and the close pulse powered the 'trailing' blade. The         exposure sequence started with the leading blade covering the         aperture. An open pulse moved the leading blade, uncovering the         aperture, and the close pulse moved the trailing blade, in the         same direction, covering the aperture again. The permanent         magnets in the rotary solenoid of each blade held the blades in         a detent position when the shutter was not powered. Exposures         could be taken with the blades moving in either direction. A         total of 4096 exposure times were available that ranged from 5 ms         to 20s, in 5ms increments. There was also a bulb command, for         longer exposures, that allowed the shutter to be held open for         any desired length of time.           This double-bladed shutter had the property that in one direction         the exposures are 1.4 ms shorter, and in the other direction are         0.4ms longer, than commanded.  Therefore, a setting of 5ms, which         was the shortest possible, resulted in alternate 5.4ms and 3.6ms         exposures, those at 25 ms, alternate 25.4ms and 23.6ms exposures,         and so on.  This asymmetry is referred to as the shutter polarity,         with the two directions designated forward (FWD) and backward         (BCK).  Occasionally bias frames, for which the commanded exposure         is zero and so for which also the shutter does not move, are taken         for transmission to Earth.  Bias frames do not change the shutter         polarity.           SDN: Another zero-exposure operation which does not change shutter         polarity was a readout of the CCD without storing the resultant         pixel data.  This was performed four times as part of each normal         NAVCAM power-on sequence.  It was also used as a keep-alive         command, executed every 361s while the NAVCAM was powered on, to         prevent the triggering of an automatic timeout which put the         instrument into a low-power mode.  In the low-power mode the NAVCAM         could not be commanded or otherwise returned to an operational         state except by powering it off and then on again.           Extensive analysis of images from the Stardust prime mission,         as well as calibration images taken during the Stardust-NExT         extended mission, further refined the knowledge of the shutter         performance.  In the end a polarity-dependent and image         line-dependent model was developed to model the actual exposure         time of each pixel in an image.  It was also discovered that         zero-exposure frames, such as bias frames or keep-alive CCD         readouts, do not change the polarity of the shutter (as had been         stated in the prime mission version of this catalog).  See the         calibration documentation for further details.           Detector       --------         The NAVCAM used a charge coupled device (CCD) detector packaged         for the Cassini Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS). The typical         operating temperature range was -55 C to -15 C. The CCD was mounted         in a hermetically sealed package, which was back-filled with argon.         An operating temperature of around -35 C was needed for suppression         of dark current and to minimize proton gamma and neutron radiation         effects. The NAVCAM employed passive radiative cooling to maintain         the detector operating temperature.           NAVCAM detector characteristics were:             Format               1024 x 1024 pixels           Pixel size           12 x 12 micrometers           Full well            >= 100,000 e-           Dark current         < 30 e-/pixel/sec at operating temperature           Charge transfer efficiency  0.99996 at operating temperature           Read Noise           <= 90 e- rms           Scan Mirror Mechanism       ---------------------         This mechanism enabled the stationary wide angle optics (flying         sideways during encounter) to keep the comet in view during         flyby. The scanning mirror, located some distance forward of         the camera lens faced 45 degrees away from the camera viewing         axis. Rotating the mirror about the camera axis at the proper         rate enabled comet tracking during flyby. The mechanism was a         single degree of freedom device. It required proper spacecraft         orientation so that the comet could be viewed in a viewing plane         originating at the scan mirror and oriented perpendicular to         the camera axis. The initial forward looking view (0 degree         position) was through a periscope which protected the scan         mirror. The mirror's home position was at -20 degrees, at which         the camera saw a black object on the spacecraft. Total mirror         rotation was 220 degrees, allowing views up to 20 degrees beyond         looking straight back. The maximum rotational rate was         approximately 3.1 degrees/sec.           The mechanism comprised a cylindrical section with mirror and         an anti-backlash mechanism, the drive unit with motor, gearbox         and slip clutch and a base that housed the control         electronics. The cylindrical section was coaxial with the camera         lens. It comprised the rotational housing containing the         mirror and a stationary housing with an anti-backlash mechanism         attached to it. The sections of the housing that held the main         bearings were made from titanium to enable accurate operations         over a 100-degrees C temperature range. A smooth rotational         motion was further assured by a duplex bearing pair, by         precision gears and an anti-backlash mechanism utilizing a         negator spring to produce a constant torque against the         rotational motion. This performance should have limited pixel smear         to approximately 2 pixels. The mirror, made of zerodur, was bonded         to flexures that attached to the rotational housing. Baffling         rings along the optical path reflected some, but not all, stray         light away from the lens.           The drive unit next to the housing comprised the following         components.  A brushless DC motor from American Electronics         Inc.:  Vmax=36V, T=10oz-in, n~1200rpm. This motor was previously         space qualified for the MISR project. The motor was flanged onto         the four stage planetary gearbox made by American Technology         Consortium: e=252.6:1. The gearbox was previously space         qualified for the Mars Pathfinder project. A slip clutch at the         gearbox output shaft utilized a set of Belleville springs to         keep the pinion's transmitted torque within a predetermined         limit. It prevented mechanical damage in the event of control         failures that might cause the mechanism to over-rotate and hit         the stops that limit travel. The pinion was engaged with the         main gear on the rotational part, providing a fifth         transmission stage. The overall gear ratio was 2518.6:1.           Periscope       ---------         The periscope was an optical assembly that allowed the scan         mirror to look over the protective Whipple shield while it was         pointed forward, in a direction parallel to the spacecraft +X         axis. This was to protect the scan mirror from particle         impingement, that would significantly degrade its performance,         during cruise, upon approach and while flying through the comet         coma. The periscope contained two rectangular mirrors mounted at         45 degrees with respect to the space craft +X axis.           The mirrors were made out of aluminum to reduce the rate and amount         of degradation from particle impacting. For light weighting, the         mirrors were fabricated using an aluminum foam core composite         material with solid face sheets brazed onto the front and back         surfaces. Single point diamond turning was used to figure the         reflective surface of the mirrors. Since the forward looking mirror         was exposed to the impacting particles, it was post polished and         received only a very thin protected aluminum coating, while the         mirror facing away from the particle stream was nickel coated and         post polished with a thin protected aluminum coating. This process         achieves a much better mirror figure and smoother surface finish,         but the coating tends to flake off when exposed to particle impact.           The periscope structure was a graphite/epoxy composite         construction. This material was chosen to make the structure         light and to reduce thermally induced distortions from the         spacecraft to the periscope assembly. Each mirror was         kinematically mounted to the composite structure using three         triangular bipod flexures. The periscope was only utilized when         the scan mirror was looking forward. After the scan mirror had         rotated approximately 15-20 degrees down toward the spacecraft         -Z axis, it was no longer imaging through the periscope. The         periscope was designed so that the images taken while the         mirror was partly looking through the periscope could still be         used for optical navigation.           SDN:  The calibration effort further refined the understanding         of the periscope's effect on science imaging.  See the calibration         documentation for further details.           Electronics and NAVCAM Control       ------------------------------         The electronics for the NAVCAM comprised two major parts: the         camera electronics and the scan mirror electronics. The sensor         head electronics (part of the camera electronics) were mounted         on a chassis that was located behind the focal plane of the         optics, while the rest of the camera electronics and the scan         mirror electronics were housed in the baseplate support. The         NAVCAM electronics controlled NAVCAM functions and process NAVCAM         commands and telemetry. The NAVCAM electronics were powered from         the spacecraft 28-volt regulated and 34-volt unregulated power         supplies.           The portion of the camera electronics mounted behind the camera         was called the sensor head electronics. These electronics         supported the operation of the CCD detector and the preprocessing         of the detector data. The pixel data were quantized to 12 bits         giving an intra-frame dynamic range of 4096. Detector readout         rate was fixed at 300 kpixels / second. In addition, a direct         access port was included in the sensor head electronics to send         telemetry to the NAVCAM ground support equipment. This port was         used for ground testing only.           The remainder of the camera electronics was called the main         electronics. The main electronics provided the power and performed         all NAVCAM control functions. These electronics included a CCD         clock generator, image compressor, image buffer, mechanism and lamp         drivers, telemetry mux and converter, bus controller, UARTs and         power supplies. The spacecraft-specified RS-422 Bus was used for         communication with the Command and Data Handling (C&DH) unit. A         high-speed bus was used for transmission of image data, and a         low-speed bus was used for sending and receiving commands and         telemetry.           The NAVCAM scan mirror mechanism had its own interface with the         spacecraft.  This included a separate power interface, a         bi-directional low-speed RS-422 bus for telemetry and         commanding transmission, a low-speed RS-422 bus for outputting         motor rotation pulses, and a discrete output for motor         direction. All interfaces with the scan mirror mechanism were         done through one 24 pin connector designated J2 that was mounted         in the NAVCAM baseplate.         NAVCAM Commanding and Operational Modes     =======================================         All commands were transmitted and received by the NAVCAM over the       low-rate RS-422 bus. Commands received by NAVCAM were echoed back       to the spacecraft, including parity errors, so that commands with       errors could be ignored. This table contains a list of NAVCAM       commands:           Discrete Commands:             Command                       States/Contents           ---------------------------   ---------------------------------           Camera power off              Turn camera power off           Camera power on/reset state   Turn camera power on/reset camera             Camera Function Commands:             Sample Analog telemetry       1 of 8 possible channels           Sample Digital telemetry      8 registers           Move filter wheel             1- 8 positions           SDN: Readout CCD              -           Take picture (exposure time)  shutter exposure and return image                                         data/digital telemetry           Select analog telem channel   1 of 8 possible channels           Calibration lamp              On or Off           Data compression              On or Off           Shutter bulb mode             Open or close           Scan Mirror Commands:             Command                       States/Contents           ---------------------------   ---------------------------------           Sample telemetry              4 registers           Move mirror                   Mirror was rotated at specified                                         velocity           Scan Motor power              On or Off           Scan Mirror Heater            On or Off         SDN:  N.B. Mission Operations provided a detailed log of camera       commanding, which was essential in determining shutter polarity and       other camera state parameters used in NAVCAM data calibration.  See       the calibration documentation for further detail.         Telemetry Collection     ====================         The NAVCAM collected pixel data, engineering data and status       data. These data were divided into three categories:           Camera Digital:           Image data           Shutter exposure time           Lamp status (on/off)           Compression status (on/off)           FIFO status           Filter Wheel move steps           Filter Wheel position           Camera Analog:           Filter Wheel voltage           CCD Temperature           + 5 Volt supply voltage           - 5 Volt supply voltage           + 12 Volt supply voltage           - 12 Volt supply voltage           Scan Mirror           Mirror velocity           Scan motor status (on/off)           Heater Status (on/off)           Motor direction           Motor rotation pulses (tick marks)         Housekeeping telemetry comprised engineering and status data       only, packetized with appropriate header information into packets       called housekeeping packets. This telemetry was used when the       NAVCAM was in an ON power state. This telemetry was only used when       the NAVCAM was actively taking data.         Effective Data Rates     ====================         NAVCAM electronics provided a single data rate of 300 kilo-pixels       per second.         Encoding and Compression     ========================         The pixel data from the NAVCAM could be processed within the NAVCAM       in several ways. The default processing was to transmit the       converted 12-bit data. When data compression was turned on, the       12-bit data were compressed to 8 bits using a square-root compression       algorithm. This was accomplished via a look-up table stored in       ROM.         SDN:  N.B. The compression look-up table archived in early versions                  of the Stardust prime mission PDS archived NAVCAM data                  sets had an error in it; this was discovered during the                  calibration activities for Stardust-NExT.         Power Management     ================         The camera electronics were required to draw less than 8 watts, and       the scan mirror less than 10 watts, steady state. Operational       constraints were placed on the NAVCAM to limit the power drawn by       NAVCAM from the spacecraft. This table contains a list of the power       operating states.           State           Definition         ------------    ------------------------------------------------           Camera Off      28-volt power to the NAVCAM was off. Heaters                         powered directly by the spacecraft could still                         be on.           Camera On       28-volt power was applied to the NAVCAM to                         receive commands, send telemetry and take data.           Scan motor Off  Power supply to scan mirror was off. Heater could                         still be on.           Scan motor On   Power was applied to scan motor to receive                         commands, send telemetry and scan.           At power turn on, the NAVCAM registers were all set to zero. At       this point the camera was in an 'idle mode' with all clocks       running, waiting to receive commands. The camera remained in this       state until the first command was received. The states of all       mechanisms were what they were when the camera was last turned       off, except that the shutter polarity was reset.         NAVCAM Safe State     =================         In response to a concern that the NAVCAM boresight may, in a       spacecraft fault condition, be exposed to the sun (accidentally       incident sunlight), a method to protect the shutter and focal       plane of the camera was developed. The NAVCAM safe state was       defined as placing a narrow band filter in the optical path and       opening the shutter. To reset the NAVCAM to a normal operating       state, a power-on reset cleared the FPGA lockup.         Operational Considerations and Navigation Camera State History     ==============================================================         Two years after launch the NAVCAM suffered its one known failure       when the filter wheel refused to move when commanded.       Fortunately for the overall success of the STARDUST mission, it       stuck on one of the two wide-bandpass filters, the OpNav       (Optical Navigation) filter, a filter that transmitted light from       about 400 to 900 nm and had the greatest total throughput of any       of the eight filters. This filter served most engineering needs       perfectly well. The camera, however, had a Petzval lens system,       and over such a wide wavelength range suffered from some       chromatic aberration. As a result, the intrinsic point spread       function was about 1.3 pixels FWHM (the high-resolution filter,       by comparison, had a point spread function of a quarter pixel).       Further, this camera lens was manufactured in the early 1970s       for the Voyager program, and its antireflection coatings 30       years later left something to be desired. As a result, all       images exhibited a broad shallow skirt of scattered light.         When first used after launch, the camera was observed to be       heavily contaminated by a coating of unknown source and       composition. Total sensitivity was down by a factor of almost       100. A mild heating of the detector to 9 C for 143 hours,       utilizing an internal heater, resulted in a slight improvement in       performance, reducing the sensitivity loss to about a factor of       ten. Every star image still showed a huge halo of scattered       light.  Turning the spacecraft to place direct sunlight on the       radiator, normally used to cool the detector, raised the detector       temperature to 24 C for 30 minutes and resulted in great       improvement. The camera then showed sensitivity approaching that       originally expected and significantly reduced scattered light.       Following passage through perihelion and Earth gravity assist,       images were acquired of the Moon and of star fields for geometric       calibration. It was obvious that some re-contamination had       occurred during the previous three months when the spacecraft       (but not the cooled detector) was warmest. A third heating cycle       resulted in the best images since the camera left the calibration       laboratory. A five-second exposure reached magnitude 11.7 with a       signal to noise of three. The point spread was essentially the       1.3 pixels expected for the filter, though there was still a       broad, very shallow, skirt of scattered light caused by internal       reflections in the lens and by residual contamination. Camera       performance remained essentially constant for the next six       months.         After a year in deep space where power was low, communication       bandpass limited, and no imaging was attempted, a calibration       lamp image once again showed small re-contamination.       Interestingly, the periscope, which was not used for most imaging,       showed great improvement compared to two years earlier. Before       beginning the Annefrank approach, 60 hours of heating to a       temperature just above freezing was carried out with the internal       heater. No immediate check of the results of this heating cycle was       possible, but was later performed before and after the Wild 2       encounter.  Therefore, the Annefrank encounter was conducted as an       engineering test and not to gather scientific data. Great caution       must therefore be used when attempting to interpret the Annefrank       images, since they do contain considerable scattered light.         Images acquired May 21, 2003 showed that the camera resolution       was still quite good, although a faint halo of scattered light       appeared around each image. A calibration lamp image, taken on       this date, showed loss in filament resolution, apparently caused       principally by the scattered light. An image through the       periscope was considerably improved over earlier images, but       showed a great deal of scattered light on one side, presumably       from the launch adapter ring that actually occulted a bit of the       periscope on one side. A new feature was a line that was some 10       DN above the background in column 221. This line appeared sometime       between January 28 and May 21 and has remained until the final       imaging in 2011.         The project was not able to take new images until October 8 and       18, 2003. These indicated that NAVCAM had acquired some 2.5       magnitudes (a factor of ten) of obscuration over the previou",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:sdu.src,SAMPLE RETURN CAPSULE for SDU,SAMPLE RETURN CAPSULE,"     The descriptions in this file were written by Tony Farnham using information from the ``Stardust Mission Plan document'' (used by permission from the Stardust project).     Instrument description -----------------------   The Sample Return Capsule (SRC) was a system for non-destructively collecting cometary and interstellar dust particles, then storing the samples and returning them to the Earth for detailed analysis.   The Sample Return Capsule was about a meter in diameter, and opened like a clamshell, allowing the collecting grid to be deployed into the dust stream to collect samples.  The SRC was mounted along the -x-axis of the Stardust spacecraft.  It consisted of four main components: the sample collector, the aeroshell (backshell and heat shield), the parachute system, and the avionics.      Sample COllector    ----------------      The sample collector was a passive system for collecting dust    grains.  It consisted of an aluminum grid encasing multiple    microporous silica aerogel blocks that acted as the dust    collectors.  The grid array was exposed to a stream of dust    particles, which were gradually slowed by the low-density aerogel.    The aerogel dissipated the kinetic energy of the particles so they    were not destroyed during the collection process.  Graded density    media was used to give even lower density for the initial impact.      The aerogel collector grid allowed collection from both sides.  One    side of the collector (facing the +x direction) was used to collect    samples during the comet encounter and the opposite side was used    for interstellar dust collection.  Each side of the collector    contained a total of 1000 cm^2 of useful collecting area.        After the samples were obtained, the collector grid could fold up    into a compact configuration in the sample return capsule.  Stowage    of the collector was achieved by first folding the collector grid    onto the boom via the wrist joint and then folding the boom/collector    into the SRC canister via the shoulder joint.      In addition to allowing the collector grid to fold up into the SRC,    where it was protected, this deployment mechanism was the key for    maximizing the amount of time available for the capture of    interstellar dust particles. The mechanism allowed the collector to    be steered via the wrist joint about the spacecraft y-axis toward    the -z-axis. The collector field-of-view remained unobstructed by    the SRC backshield for 51 degrees of this motion, half the grid was    in shadow at 63 degrees, and all of the grid was in shadow at 75    degrees.  (Note that for the shadow definition, the ISP stream is    assumed to be incoming perpendicular to the aerogel grid.) It is    worth noting that the collector field-of-view would remain    completely unobstructed for 65 degrees of the motion should the    shoulder joint be used during interstellar dust particle    collection.  However, usage of the shoulder joint with the    collector fully deployed was considered to be an unnecessary risk.        Aeroshell    ---------      The aeroshell was used to protect the SRC during the cruise phases    and during re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere.  During re-entry,    the aeroshell removed over 99 percent of the initial kinetic energy    of the vehicle and protected the sample canister against the extreme    aerodynamic heating of atmospheric entry.  The heat shield was a 60    degree half angle blunt cone made of a graphite/epoxy composite    covered with a thermal protection system.  Ablative material was    also applied to the backshell to protect the capsule from the    effects of recirculation flow.        Parachute System    ----------------      During the entry and descent phases, a G-switch initiated timer with    backup pressure sensors provided the required parachute deployment    timing.  The parachute system incorporated a drogue and main chute    into a single parachute canister.  The parachute canister contained a    mortar tube that held the drogue chute. A gas cartridge was housed    outside the canister and was used to pressurize the mortar tube and    expel the drogue chute.  The drogue chute was used to stabilize the    descending SRC through the transonic and subsonic atmospheric    regimes. The drogue was discarded using one of two redundant cutters,    extracting the main chute as it moves away from the SRC. Upon ground    impact, a cutter in the riser of the main chute was commanded by a    G-switch, separating the main chute from the SRC to prevent surface    winds from dragging the SRC across the ground.        Avionics    --------      The avionics design included a UHF locator beacon used as an SRC    location aid for the ground recovery team.  The beacon was activated    upon main chute deployment.  It was powered by a set of primary cell    lithium sulfur dioxide batteries, which had enough capacity to    operate the beacon for 40 hours. Additional SRC tracking was provided    by skin tracking from two C-band radar sites at the Utah Test and    Training Range (UTTR) landing site. A mylar target mounted on the main    chute provides an equivalent one square meter of radar cross section.     Earth Return Sequence ---------------------   On January 15, 2006, the Sample Return Capsule returned to the Earth. Prior to separation, the spacecraft was placed at the separation attitude and the SRC was spun up using a spin release mechanism. This provided the spin stabilization that the SRC required for successful atmospheric entry.  After the SRC separated, the spacecraft executed a divert maneuver, to put it into a heliocentric orbit.   The SRC entered the atmosphere at 09:57 UTC on January 15, 2006.  The SRC continued to free-fall to an altitude of about 3 km, at which point the parachute deployed, allowing the SRC to safely land at the Utah Test and Training Range.  It was recovered and transported to a staging area at UTTR for retrieval of the sample canister, which was then be transported to the planetary materials curatorial facility at Johnson Space Center.

Excerpts for the instrument are provided here.           LASCO Overview       ==============           The Large Angle Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) is a wide-field white       light and spectrometric coronagraph consisting of three optical systems       having nested fields of view that together observe the solar corona from       just above the limb at 1.1 Rsun out to very great elongations.           The three telescopes comprising LASCO are designated the C1, with coverage       from 1.1 to 3.0 Rsun, the C2, with coverage deliberately overlapping parts       of both C1 and C3, and extending from 2.0 to 6.0 Rsun, and the C3, which       spans the outer corona from about 3.7 to 32 Rsun. C1 is an internally       occulted coronagraph, while C2 and C3 are externally occulted instruments.       C1 has a narrow passband Fabry-Perot interferometer tuned to hot coronal       emission lines. C1 has not been used regularly since June 24, 1998, thus       telemetry since then has been re-allocated to the C2 and C3 coronagraphs.           Each of the three telescopes has a filter wheel, a polarizer wheel, and a       shutter, and each uses a front-side illuminated, 1024x1024 pixel CCD. The       pixel scale of the telescopes are 5.6 ''/pixel in C1, 11.8 ''/pixel in C2       and 56 ''/pixel in C3. The quantum efficiency of the CCD is about 0.3-0.5       in the 500 to 700 nm spectral region. The full discussion of the CCD     camera       is outlined in Ch 8 of Cook       (1994) [COOK1994].               Telemetry, Encoding and Compression       ===================================           LASCO is basically telemetry limited in its operations. After taking and       processing an image, the data is passed to a 2 Mbyte telemetry buffer. Its       storage capacity is approximately 10 compressed images, and with the low       spacecraft telemetry rate (4.2 Kbps) results in a transmission time of     about       60 minutes for a full 1024x1024, 2 bytes per pixel image. (Note that the       individual pixel intensities from the camera analog-to-digital converters       are actually represented by only 14 bits, leaving a factor of 4 headroom     in       the 16 bits which are reserved in the data format.) Thus, image     compression       is desirable. The average compression factor is about 10. Thus on average,       the readout time is about 6 minutes, which allows around 200 images each     day       to be transmitted.           A number of image processing techniques are included in the flight     software,       from simple square root through transform encoding. The types of     processing       and compression utilized are determined by ground command and executed       through stored sequences, with parameters stored in tables. After a camera       image is stored in a 2 Mbyte image buffer, the appropriate algorithms are       applied.  Additional compression is obtained by transmitting only the     pixels       that are not obscured by the occulting disk or the aperture stop. Time       resolution can be traded against field coverage to further reduce the data       download requirement.

(1995). Aspects related to comet observations are found in  the paper by Combi et al. (2000) from which excerpts are provided here.   SWAN Overview ------------- The SOHO spacecraft is stationed at the L1 Lagrange point which lies about  1.5 million km in front of the Earth, enabling continuous temporal  coverage of solar and solar wind events. One of the on-board instruments,  the Solar Wind ANisotropies (SWAN) camera, makes all-sky hydrogen  Lyman-alpha (H Ly-alpha) images of the hydrogen distribution in the  interplanetary medium (IPM), providing a global picture both of the solar  Ly-alpha flux, which is responsible for illuminating the hydrogen, and of  the solar wind, which is responsible for shaping the hydrogen distribution  through charge impact ionization. The typical brightness of Ly-alpha  emission from the IPM seen from the vicinity of Earth is in the range of  500 to 1000 Rayleighs. On top of the IPM emission background, brightnesses  of comets in the field of view can range from a few tens to tens of  thousands of Rayleighs.  SWAN has two identical sensor units, SU+Z and SU-Z, for observing north  and south of the ecliptic, respectively. SWAN's initial absolute  calibration was such that 1 Rayleigh of intensity gives 0.84 counts per  second per pixel in SU+Z and a factor of 2.6 less in SU-Z. A new  calibration was performed using Hubble Space Telescope Goddard High  Resolution Spectrometer observations of the IPM, and new calibration  factors that varied in time over the first several years of SWAN operation  were found. Details are provided in the paper by Combi et al. (2011). Each  sensor has an instantaneous field of view (IFOV) of 5 degrees by 5 degrees  with a multianode detector of 25 1 degree by 1 degree pixels. Full coma  images are made by mosaicking the IFOV across the sky. Some comets in the  early years were specifically targeted with special observations that  oversampled the 1 degree pixels by a factor, but most comet observations  were derived from the standard daily full-sky images. The uncertainties in  the tabulated data reflect the mode in which the observations were made.

The focal plane array (FPA), supplied by the Max Planck Institute for Aeronomy (MPAe), has heritage from the Imager for Mars Pathfinder (IMP) and the descent imager (DISR) on the Huygens probe. There are two identical 256 x 256 pixel arrays, normally subframed to 248 x 256 for each eye; each field of view (FOV) is 13.88 x 14.38. Since the SSI is a copy of IMP, it maintains the same eye separation of 15.0 cm, and the light path is folded by two sets of mirrors to bring the light to the FPA. Prior to compression, a single-eye SSI frame contains 248 x 256 x 12 bits, or 762 kb. Downlinking the data 'raw' (uncompressed) requires putting the 12-bit data into 16-bit words by adding 4 flag-bits, resulting in an effective compression ratio of 0.75:1 and a 1.00 Mb image. Both the lossy (JPEG) and lossless (Rice) compressors efficiently discard these extra bits, and compression ratios refer to the original 12-bit/pixel image (e.g., a 762-kb full frame compressed at 6:1 requires 127 kb of downlink). About 100 frames are combined into a monochromic panorama, which brings the data volume to 76 Mb; instrument and packet headers add another 5% for a total of 80 Mb. A typical day on Mars allows the return of 30 Mb of SSI data. Therefore compression is an indispensable tool for the early mission. A 6:1 compressed panorama has few artifacts, compresses to 13 Mb, and is easily returned during a single sol.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:static.maven,STATIC,Supra-Thermal and Thermal Ion Composition,"The Supra-Thermal And Thermal Ion Composition (STATIC) instrument is designed to measure the ion composition and distribution function of the cold Martian ionosphere, of the heated suprathermal tail of this plasma in the upper ionosphere, and the pickup ions accelerated by solar wind electric fields. STATIC operates over an energy range of 0.1 eV up to 30 keV, with a base time resolution of 4 seconds. The instrument consists of a toroidal “top hat” electrostatic analyzer with a 360 degree x 90 degree field-of-view, combined with a time-of-flight (TOF) velocity analyzer with 22.5 degree resolution in the detection plane. The TOF combines a -15 kV acceleration voltage with ultra-thin carbon foils to resolve H+, He++, He+, O+, O2+, and CO2+ ions. Secondary electrons from carbon foils are detected by microchannel plate detectors and binned into a variety of data products with varying energy, mass, angle, and time resolution. To prevent detector saturation when measuring cold RAM ions at periapsis (~10**11 eV/cm**2-s-sr-eV) while maintaining adequate sensitivity to resolve tenuous pickup ions at apoapsis (~10**3 eV/cm**2-s-sreV), the sensor includes both mechanical and electrostatic attenuators that increase the dynamic range by a factor of 10**3. The STATIC sensor is mounted on the APP boom, along with NGIMS and IUVS, so that it can be pointed in the ram direction during periapsis passes. During apoapsis, pointing of the APP is alternated between optimal viewing for IUVS and STATIC, both of which depend on orbit parameters and local time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:suisei.esp,SOLAR-WIND EXPERIMENT for SUISEI,SOLAR-WIND EXPERIMENT,"         Instrument Overview     ===================       The objective of this experiment is to measure the       three-dimensional velocity distributions of the       solar-wind ions and electrons in the energy range       from 30 eV up to 16 keV within +/- 30deg of the       ecliptic plane.  During the cometary encounter, the       interaction of the solar wind with the cometary       ionosphere will be investigated, paying particular       attention to the mass loading of the solar wind by       cometary ions, to the existence, location and       strength of the upstream shock transition and of       (possibly) backscattered particles from the shock       and other,unexpected, plasma populations.  Data       will be collected on such solar-wind phenomena as       the halo and core distributions of electrons,       variations in the flow velocity, and the He++/He+       ratio in relation to solar rotation and longitude.           The instrument consists of one sensor for electrons       and one for positive ions.  As shown in Figure 3,       each sensor consists of a fan-shaped collimator, a       270deg spherical electrostatic analyzer, and a       Micro-Channel Plate (MCP) detector with five       discrete anodes.  The collimator's field of view is       5deg in azimuth and 60deg in polar angle       respectively, the latter being centered       perpendicular to the spacecraft spin axis and thus       in the ecliptic plane.  The 270deg spherical       analyzer has a better-defined response in       energy-angle space than a quadrispherical analyzer.           After leaving the analyzer, particles are       post-accelerated by a potential of 250 V for       electron and 2500 - 3500 V for ion analysis.  A       Z-type three-stacked MCP detector is used to obtain       a saturated pulse-height distribution over a wide       dynamic range of counting rates.  The anodes of       each MCP are split into five sections in order to       provide a five-point angular distribution with a       12deg resolution in the polar direction.  The       output pulses from each MCP anode are amplified,       shaped and accumulated in 19-bit counters.  The       contents of the counter are compressed into 8 bits       and stored temporarily in the PAM buffer memory.       The instrument's angular distribution in the       azimuthal direction, obtained by the spacecraft       spin, is 5.625deg within +/- 22.5deg of the solar       direction and 22.5deg in the remaining spin phase.           The instrument has four modes of energy scanning       (Table below).  In each mode the energy is scanned       in steps as E(n)=30 exp (0.0066n), where E(n) is       the energy of the n-th step and n=n(1), . . . .       .,n(2).  Details of the energy scanning, which is       synchronized to the spin phase, are shown for the       E1-mode in Figure 5.  During each spacecraft spin       four energy steps are scanned periodically in every       22.5deg interval, i.e.  the step is changed every       1.40625deg around the solar direction and 5.625deg       over the remaining azimuthal directions.       Consequently, it takes 24 spacecraft spins in the       E1-mode to cover the complete energy range in 96       steps.         At high bit rate (2048 bit/s), three-dimensional       velocity distributions will be obtained for both       electrons and ions.  These data, produced during       one spin, will be transmitted in 10 PCM frames (5       s) during the next spin interval.  At low bit rate       (64 bit/s), two-dimensional distributions will be       obtained for electrons and ions by summing the       counts from each anode.  The energy scanning will       be carried out over 16 spin periods once every 512       s, required to transmit these data.         The ESP instrument will be operated during the       Halley-encounter phase as well as during the cruise       and post-encounter phases, but only while Planet-A       is in its high-spin-rate mode (nominally 6.3 rpm).   ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Table 2.

A Cerenkov counter (C) had four output channels (C1, C2, C3, and CDC) sensitive to electrons having energies above 6, 9, 13, and 1 MeV, respectively. An electron-scatter counter (E) had three output channels (E1, E2, and E3) sensitive to electrons above .16, .26, and .46 MeV. A minimum ionization counter (M) had three output channels, M1 sensitive to electrons having energies greater than 35 MeV, M2 that measured background, and M3 that was sensitive to protons having energies greater than 80 MeV. The last two sensors were scintillator detectors (SP and SE), both of which had energy thresholds of 10 keV for electrons and 150 keV for protons. The sensitivity of the SE detector to protons was about a factor of 10 lower than its sensitivity to electrons. Thus, the SEDC channel effectively measured the electron flux, which could then be subtracted from the SPDC channel response to obtain the proton flux. Several other channels, listed above, required corrections to obtain the fluxes of the species indicated. Three of the channels (CDC, SPDC, and SEDC) were read out through a common electrometer. Due to a malfunction that occurred between launch and Jovian encounter, these three channels produced no usable encounter data. The detector channels could be programmed for readout in any one of four patterns at each of the eight spacecraft bit rate modes. During encounter when the spacecraft was operating in the highest bit rate mode, the minimum time to sample one channel was 1.5 s and the time to obtain a complete scan through all channels was 108 s. Since the directional detectors pointed perpendicular to the spin axis and the spin rate was 5 rpm, pitch-angle measurements were obtained. While the experiment was primarily designated for encounter studies, some data were obtained at low rates in interplanetary space.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:uvis.co,ULTRAVIOLET IMAGING SPECTROGRAPH for CO,ULTRAVIOLET IMAGING SPECTROGRAPH,"   The Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph Subsystem (UVIS) is a set of telescopes used to measure ultraviolet light from the Saturn system's atmospheres, rings, and surfaces. The UVIS will also observe the fluctuations of starlight and sunlight as the sun and stars move behind the rings and the atmospheres of Titan and Saturn, and it will determine the atmospheric concentrations of hydrogen and deuterium.   The following is a brief description of the components of the UVIS. For a more detailed description, see [ESPOSITOETAL2005] and contained in the DOCUMENT directory of this archive (pending permission).   The UVIS has two spectrographic channels: the extreme ultraviolet channel and the far ultraviolet channel. The ultraviolet channels are built into weight-relieved aluminum cases, and each contains a reflecting telescope, a concave grating spectrometer, and an imaging, pulse-counting detector. The UVIS also includes a high-speed photometer channel, a hydrogen-deuterium absorption cell channel, and an electronic and control subassembly.   The extreme ultraviolet channel (EUV) will be used for imaging spectroscopy and spectroscopic measurements of the structure and composition of the atmospheres of Titan and Saturn. The EUV consists of a telescope with a three-position slit changer, a baffle system, and a spectrograph with a CODACON microchannel plate detector and associated electronics. The telescope consists of an off-axis parabolic section with a focal length of 100 mm, a 22 mm by 30 mm aperture, and a baffle with a field of view of 3.67 degrees by 0.34 degrees. A precision mechanism positions one of the three entrance slits at the focal plane of the telescope, each translating to a different spectral resolution.   The spectrograph uses an aberration-corrected toroidal grating that focuses the spectrum onto an imaging microchannel plate detector to achieve both high sensitivity and spatial resolution along the entrance slit. The microchannel plate detector electronics consist of a low-voltage power supply, a programmable high-voltage power supply, charge-sensitive amplifiers, and associated logic.   The EUV channel also contains a solar occultation mechanism to allow solar flux to enter the telescope when the sun is still 20 degrees off-axis from the primary telescope.   The far ultraviolet channel (FUV) will be used for imaging spectroscopy and spectroscopic measurements of the structure and composition of the atmospheres of Titan and Saturn and of the rings. The FUV is similar to the EUV channel except for the grating ruling density, optical coatings, and detector details.  The FUV electronics are similar to those for the EUV except for the addition of a high-voltage power supply for the ion pump.   The high-speed photometer channel (HSP) will perform stellar occultation measurements of the structure and density of material in the rings. The HSP resides in its own module and measures undispersed (zero-order) light from its own parabolic mirror with a photomultiplier tube detector. The electronics consist of a pulse-amplifier-discriminator and a fixed-level high-voltage power supply.   The hydrogen-deuterium absorption cell channel (HDAC) will be used to measure hydrogen and deuterium in the Saturn system using a hydrogen cell, a deuterium cell, and a channel electron multiplier (CEM) detector to record photons not absorbed in the cells. The hydrogen and deuterium cells are resonance absorption cells filled with pure molecular hydrogen and deuterium, respectively. They are located between an objective lens and a detector. Both cells are made of stainless steel coated with teflon and are sealed at each end with MgF2 windows.  The electronics consist of a pulse-amplifier- discriminator, a fixed-level high-voltage power supply, and two filament current controllers.   The UVIS microprocessor electronics and control subassembly consists of input-output elements, power conditioning, science data and housekeeping data collection electronics, and microprocessor control elements.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:uwo_meteor_radar.cmor.cmor_inst,Canadian Meteor Orbit Radar (CMOR),Canadian Meteor Orbit Radar (CMOR),"The Canadian Meteor Orbit Radar (CMOR) is located at the University of Western Ontario (UWO) meteor radar complex near Tavistock, Ontario, and has been in operation since late 2001.  It consists of three separate interferometric radars, synchronized in transmission and reflection and operating from a single site.  Details of the system may be found in Jones et al. (2005) and Webster et al.  (2004).  The three systems operate at 17.45, 29.85, and 38.15 MHz.  The ""orbit"" component of the system applies only to the 29.85 MHz system which has two outlying remote stations (6.2 and 8.1 km respectively from the main site) providing reflections from portions of the meteor trail not directly accessible from the specular reflections to the main site.  For these echoes, the interferometry from the main site provides sufficient information to permit measurement of velocity vectors for individual meteors.  Each of the three systems has seven antennae and seven separate receivers.  For the 17 and 38 MHz systems all seven receivers are used for reception (to boost signal to noise levels) but only five are used for determination of the measured echo direction using interferometry.  The 29 MHz system uses the two extra receivers to record signals from the two outlying stations.  The transmit and receive antennae have broad (nearly all-sky) gain patterns.  The transmit antenna is a vertically directed horizontally-polarized three-element Yagi with G = 7.6 dB(i) (relative to an isotropic radiator) and a beam width to the 3 dB points of 30 degrees.  The receive antennae are all two-element vertically directed horizontally polarized Yagis with G = 6.5 dB(i) and beam widths of 45 degrees to the 3 dB points.  Directions to each echo are measured using the relative phase difference between the antennae within each of the 5-element interferometer arrays.  The interferometric error is less than 0.5 degrees for echoes with elevations above 30 degrees found for simulation for echoes with SNRs of 15 dB.  Due to the degradation in interferometric accuracy at low elevations, no echoes are processed with their nominal elevation is below 20 degrees.  All receivers are cosmic noise limited.  The variation in noise levels is controlled principally by galactic cosmic noise at HF/VHF frequencies and produces a diurnal noise variation of 2 dB for the 29 and 38 MHz systems.  The 17 MHz system suffers from heavy terrestrial interference during the day, limiting useful echo detections to night-time hours only.  For the 29 MHz orbital system, the absolute minimal detectable signal strength corresponds to meteors with radio magnitudes near +9.  However, effective counting statistics for 29.85 MHz are complete only to +8 due to the roll-off in sensitivity as the absolute detection threshold is reached - this is the effective detection limit for the radar and corresponds to meteoroids of ~10^-7 kg mass for an average velocity of 30 km/sec.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:vega1.ducma,DUST PARTICLE COUNTER AND MASS ANALYZER for VEGA1,DUST PARTICLE COUNTER AND MASS ANALYZER,"       Instrument Overview     ===================         The detector is a 28 Km thick film of polarised       polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), covered on each       face with a metallic conducting coating.  A dust       particle impacting the detector will displace a       small volume of polarised material in the bulk of       the detector, which then results in a fast       depolarisation signal whose amplitude is a known       function of the particle mass and velocity.       Electronic circuits measure the pulse height and       ac- cumulate pulse events above four different       threshold levels.  Since the relative impact       velocity is known (i.e.  the comet-spacecraft       velocity), the mass is determined direct- ly from       the known mass/velocity relationship for these       detectors.  The detector assembly consists of the       dust detector (M), and a small anti-coincidence       detector (V), mounted perpendicular to the       direction of arrival of the dust particles.  The       purpose of the small detector is to detect very       large mechanical shocks on the spacecraft which       might trigger the most sensitive level of the dust       detector.  Further technical details are given in       the table below, where the values for the       'differential dust mass ranges' are published in       Simpson et al.  'Ducma Measurements of Comet Halley       Dust Mass Spectra Bases on Post-Encounter Dust       Calibrations', Asteroids, Comets, and Meteors III       (1990, Uppsala).  This instrument was selected one       year before launch and could still be considered at       this late stage because it did not require any       direct telemetry or telecommand inter- face with       the spacecraft.  Its inclusion was facilitated       because it was allowed to share the data format and       telecommands initially allocated to the ING       instrument.    -----------------------------------------------------  Table.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:vega1.iks,INFRARED SPECTROMETER for VEGA1,INFRARED SPECTROMETER,"         Instrument Overview     ===================       The infrared spectrometer was designed to study the       radiation from the inner coma, in the wavelength       range 2.5-12 micro m.  The instrument included two       high-resolution spectral channels for the chemical       analysis of the cometary matter, gas and dust, and       an image modulation channel for determination of       the size of and thermal emission from the nucleus.       The light that exits from the telescope wass       divided into three beams by means of two beam       splitters.  The secondary beams were then focussed       on a wheel that rotated at the rate of 8 rev/sec       and carried three rings, namely two circular       variable filters and one image modulator.  Behind       the encoding wheel, the beams entered a cryostat       which cooled the three detectors.  The two filters       covered the ranges 2.5-5 micro m and 6-12 micro m,       which included the emission bands of the parent       molecules.  The long-wave channel could detect       water ice and the short-wave channel could be used       to identify a number of minerals, such as       silicates.  The imaging channel did not resolve       details of the nucleus, the objective being to       derive its most important parameters: size, shape,       temperature and optical properties in the infrared.       To accommodate the nucleus pointing uncertainties,       a field of view of 1deg was judged necessary and an       angular resolution of 1 arcmin satisfactory.  More       instrument characteristics are given in the table       below.  Since the sensitivity of the instruments       was degraded by four to five orders of magnitude       between 77 K and room temperature, it appeared       mandatory to cool the detectors during the two       measuring sequences using the Joule-Thomson       expansion of nitrogen.  For that purpose, 2 l of       nitrogen were stored in four tanks at a pressure of       350 atm.  The detector temperatures reached       stability within 25 min (to +/- 0.1deg) and could       be maintained so for 3 h.     ------------------------------------------------ Table.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:vega1.pm1,PLASMA ENERGY ANALYZER for VEGA1,PLASMA ENERGY ANALYZER,"       Instrument Overview     ===================         The instrument includes six detectors: two ion       analysers, one electron analyser, two collectors       which measure the integral plasma ion flux, and one       sensor which monitors the integral electron current       produced from its surface by photon and particle       bom- bardment.  The ion detectors are designed for       the study of the energy distribution of the solar       and cometary particles, and not for the       investigation of their three- dimensional velocity       distribution.  Each sensor consists of a       quadripolar electrical lens (2), a hemispherical       plate analyser (3) and a channeltron (4).  The       energy spectrum is swept once per second by       stepping the bias voltage U(A) applied between the       plates.  The detector oriented towards the Sun has       a conical of view (1) with a half angle of 15deg,       wide enough to detect the solar wind both upstream       and downstream of the cometary bow shock.  The ion       detector oriented along the spacecraft-comet       velocity vector is intended for operation in the       innermost part of the coma, where the cometary ions       are expected to have thermal velocities that are       negligible with respect to their relative drift       velocity of 78 km/s.  This system can therefore be       used as a mass spectrometer in the range 1-110 amu       with a resolution m/delta m = 20; the minimum       measurable ion density is 10**-3/cm**3.  The       electron analyser has an aperture of 0.03 cm**2, an       angular resolu- tion of +/-2.5deg, and an energy       resolution of +/-5%; its geometrical factor is       10**-5 E (keV) (cm**2.sr.keV).  Its aperture is       oriented perpendicular to the Sun and relative-       velocity directions in order to eliminate       interferences generated by photon and particle       impacts.  The energy spectrum is scanned by       applying a series of logarithmically distributed       voltage steps U(A) to a cylindrical deflection unit       (1).  The entrance of the instrument is controlled       by a collimator (2) and a grid (3); the detector is       a channeltron (4).  The integral detector which       measures the solar-wind ions consists of a       collimator, a number of grids to limit the flux of       photoelectrons, and a collector.  A potential of       +3500 V is periodically applied to one of the grids       in order to stop the ion flux and evaluate the       interference background.  The aperture has an area       of 5 cm**2 and the dynamic range of the       measurements extends from +/- 10**-11 A to +/-       3x10**-9 A.  The integral detector, which is       aligned with the relative-velocity vector, has       similar features, but the electrodes are configured       such that the incoming dust par- ticles and neutral       molecules can only impact on the first diaphragm       and on the collec- tor.  By biasing the electrodes       differently, in an alternative configuration, it is       possible to discriminate between the cometary ions       and the charged particles produced by various       impact ionisation processes.  The impact plasma       monitor is a gold electrode, biased at a fixed       potential of -17 V, which measures the integral       flux of electrons emitted by the impact of neutral       gas, dust particles and photons, in the range       10**-10-3x10**-5 A.  The characteristics of the       various detectors are summarised in the table       below.       --------------------------------------------------------------------- Table.

Grard, ESA/ESTEC, Noordwijk, The Netherlands) A1 Faraday cup for measuring integral ion flux from solar direction, A2 Faraday cup for measuring integral ion flux and neutral particles    from ram direction, A3 spherical electrostatic analyzer for measuring ions from ram    direction in the energy range of 15 eV - 3.6 keV in 120    logarithmically spaced channels, A4 spherical electrostatic analyzer for measuring ions from solar    direction in the energy range of 60 eV - 30 keV in 60    logarithmically spaced channels, A5 cylindrical electrostatic analyzer for measuring ions perpendicular    to the ecliptic plane in the energy range of 2 eV - 10 keV in    30 logarithmically spaced channels.           Scientific objectives         The electrostatic ion analyzers A3 and A4 were       designed to study the change of the energy       distribution of the solar wind and cometary ions as       a function of the distance from the nucleus.  The       detector oriented in the ram direction could       determine the mass distribution of cometary ions       close to the nucleus with a resolution of       m/dm=20-25.  The ram Faraday cup A2 had four modes       of operation.  Two of these provided information on       the neutral particle flow from the comet.

Detectors A3 and A5 of Vega-1 were fatally damaged during the cruise  phase.Detector A3 of Vega-2 was fatally damaged 2.5 min before  closest approach. The channeltrons of A3 were saturating at higher  count rates.    Calibration description    The sensors were calibrated at the Max-Planck-Institut for Aeronomy  in Katlenburg/Lindau, Germany. The viewing angle and energy resolution  of the electrostatic analyzers were determined in vacuum chamber  using monoenergetic ion and electron beams, respectively.  (For further details see reference #3 above.)  The spectrometers used Soviet-made channeltrons as particle detectors.  An in-flight calibration was performed every day to select the  optimum voltage for the channeltrons.  A post-launch calibration was performed in order to correct the saturating  count rates of detector A3 of Vega-2 using the integral fluxes provided  by the ram Faraday cup A2.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:vega1.puma,DUST IMPACT MASS ANALYZER for VEGA1,DUST IMPACT MASS ANALYZER,"         Instrument Overview     ===================         The dust mass spectrometer measures the chemical       composition, the size and the spatial density of       solid particles using a time-of-flight technique,       with particular emphasis on the determination of       the Li, C and B isotopic ratios.  The operating       Principle of PUMA, illustrated in Figure 8a, is       similar to that of the PIA instrument flown on       Giotto.  The dust particles enter through a baffle       and impact on a silver target (M) at a speed of 78       km/s.  The particles and a certain amount of the       target material are vaporized and partly ionized.       The two Vega spacecraft have different targets; one       type is mounted in a cartridge as in the PIA, the       second has a corrugated surface such that a larger       amount of projectile ions enter the analyzer.  The       target is at + 1020 V; the ions are accelerated by       a grid (1), which is held at a potential of -2000       V, and enter the field-free drift tube at zero       potential (4).  These charged particles are sent by       the electrostatic reflector (5) into the second       drift tube (6) and on towards the detector (7).       The ions trajectories are focused by the lenses       (9), (10) and (11).  A set of three electrodes       (12), consisting of an inner grid at +1000 V       between two grids at zero potential, prevents ions       with energies less than 1 keV from reaching the       detector.  The geometry of the reflector is       designed in such a way as to bunch ions of the same       species (particles with energies E>E(0) travel a       larger distance than those with energies E<E(0))       and to eliminate those with energies that deviate       too much from E(0).  The purpose of this mirror       system is to reduce the dispersion of the flight       times for particles having the same charge-to-mass       ratios.  The reflector potential is switch- between       1000 V and 1100 V every 30 s, in order to       compensate for the higher energies of ions created       by the impacts of larger particles.  The       time-of-flight is measured with reference to three       signals: the light flash recorded by the       photomultiplier (3), the pulses detected by the       target (M), and the accelerating grid (1).  The       signals induced in these sensors, in the first lens       (9), in the ejecta trap (8) and in the detector       (7), which are illustrated qualitatively in Figure       8c, are used to characterize the mass of the       particles.  Additional information about PUMA is       given in the table below.     Table.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:vega1.sp1,DUST IMPACT PLASMA DETECTOR for VEGA1,DUST IMPACT PLASMA DETECTOR,"         Instrument Overview     ===================       This instrument detects the electric charges     contained in the plasma cloud generated by a solid     particle impacting on a gold target.  The principle     of this technique is similar to that adopted for the     impact plasma detectors of SP-2.  The magnitude of     the positive and negative charges is proportional to     the mass of the particle Q=Am, where A= 10**3C/s for     an impact velocity of 78 km/s.  The SP-1 system     includes two similar detectors.  Each unit is made up     of a base plate (1) covered by a gold target (2) at     zero potential, perpendicular to the dust flow, and     an array of strip collectors (4).  The collectors are     parallel to the dust flow; they are mounted on an     insulator (3) and their edge is protected from     impacts by a shield (5) connected electrically to the     structure.  Adjacent collectors are biased at     potentials of 30 V, with opposite polarities.  The     two sets of electrodes in each detector detect a     positive and a negative current pulse, which are     analysed and recorded by the electronics unit.  The     entrance to one detector is covered by a plastic     foil, to obtain additional information on density     and/or calibration factor.  The characteristic     parameters of SP-1 are given in Table 8.       ----------------------------------------------------------------- Table 8.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:vega1.sp2,DUST PARTICLE DETECTOR for VEGA1,DUST PARTICLE DETECTOR,"         Instrument Overview     ===================         The acoustical detector consists of three       piezo-electric elements mounted on a mem- brane       (3), two of these sensors (4) are connected to two       identical recording circuits in order to improve       the overall reliability of the system; the third       element (5) is used as a stimuli source for       calibration purposes.  The membrane is mounted in a       frame (l) which damps the mechanical oscillations       and improves the counting rate.  The detector       assembly is fixed to the electronics box (6) by       means of three acoustical insulators (2).  Each       piezo-electric element delivers a signal which is       fed into a narrow-band amplifier working at a       frequency of about 160 kHz.  The output signal is       split into l6 channels, which have their       sensitivity thresholds logarithmically distributed       across the whole dynamic range.  Four identical       impact plasma detectors are mounted at the       periphery of the acoustical detector.  They are       associated in pairs and connected to identical       electronic circuits.  The entrance to each detector       is protected against the environmental plasma by a       system of deflecting electrodes and grids (7,8).       The ions and electrons generated by each particle       impact are separated and collected by a grid (9)       and a target (10), bet- ween which a potential       difference of 2 kV is applied.  The electron pulse       detected by the lower electrode constitutes the       input signal, which is analysed in several channels       with different sensitivity thresholds.  The       threshold sensitivity of the dust particle acoustic       detector in terms of the transferred momentum is       given by Pmin ~ 2x10**-5 gcm/s.  Taking into       account that the recoil momentum may exceed the       particle momentum mV by 5 to 10 times, the minimum       mass of recorded particles is < 3x10**-13 g.  The       measurement range n (> m)x3x10**-13 to ~ 2x10**-6 g       is divided into 16 channels.  With the relative       width delta/m ~ 2.82, sensitive area S = 500 cm**2,       accumulation time for one spectrum is 1 s, which       corresponds to the spatial resolution ~ 80 km over       the flyby trajectory.  The counting rate of small       mass particles is about 4095 1/s.  The ionization       detector is capable of recording particles with       mass 3x10**-16 to 3x10**-11g.  The number of       channels is 6, with relative width delta/m = 10,       sensitive area - 40 cm**2.  The limit counting rate       of small mass particles is ~ 65,500 1/s.  The       accumulation time for one spectrum is 1 s.  The       characteristic features of SP-2 are listed in the       table below.       -------------------------------------------------------------------- Table.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:vega1.tnm,TUNDE-M ENERGETIC PARTICLE ANALYZER for VEGA1,TUNDE-M ENERGETIC PARTICLE ANALYZER,"         Instrument Overview     ===================         The prime objective of the energetic-particle       analyzer is to measure the energy and flux of the       cometary ions that might be accelerated by, for       example, solar-wind magnetic fields.  Two similar       telescopes provide information about the angular       distribution of the ion flux.  The first telescope,       T1 is viewing at 55 deg to the east of the Sun;and       the T2 telescope, looks at 90 deg to the east of       the Sun, both in the ecliptic plane and       approximately opposite to the spacecraft velocity       vector.  Each telescope consists of two silicon       detectors, A (8 mm in diameter and 0.1 mm thick)       and B (16 mm in diameter and 1 mm thick), and an       anti-coincidence scintillation shield.  Electrons       with energies of less than 0.2 MeV are deflected       away from the entrance aperture by a magnet.  The       low-energy (30-640 keV) ions trigger a signal in       detector A only.  More energetic particles are       detected in both A and B, and it is possible to       distinguish between electrons, protons and heavier       nuclei by comparing the amplitudes of the signals       delivered by the two detectors.  The characteristic       parameters of these two telescopes are given in the       table below.        Table.

Ions (probably mostly       water group) were successfully observed (for       details, see Somogyi et al.

Instrument Section/ Modes of Operation    TUNDE-M consists of two particle telescopes: T1 is viewing  at 55 deg to the east of the Sun, T2 looks at 90 deg to  the east of the Sun, both in the ecliptic plane. The  telescopes consist of two circular surface barrier  semiconductor detectors with an Al layer of  15x10**-6 g/cm**2 coated on the front detector (A)  and an anticoincidence scintillation detector MCP.  Low energy electrons (below about 160 keV) were  deflected with a magnet.  Field of view (half cone): 25 deg.  Geometric factor: 0.25 cm**2 sr.  Particles stopping in the thin front detector were  not identified (they are referred as ion channels),  those reaching the thick detector were identified  via the dE/E method.    T1 was working all along the mission, T2 was rendered  inoperative before the Halley encounter.    Modes of operation: Trassa-1 and Trassa-2  (cruise phase) and BRL (fast telemetry, started at  04:17:03 UT, March 6, 1986, ended at 08:24:53 UT,  same day). Data were gathered in 66 channels, some  referred as ions, others as identified particles,  both between preset energy limits (given at the  data set description).    Data rate: 1 frame of 66 real numbers in every  4 s (BRL mode). The measurement was continuous,  with an integration time of 4 s.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:vega1.tvs,TELEVISION SYSTEM for VEGA1,TELEVISION SYSTEM,"         Instrument Overview     ===================         The television system consists of two telescopes,       one narrow-angle camera (TVY) for high-resolution       imaging of the nucleus, and one large-angle camera       (TDN) for detecting and tracking the comet.  The       TVY optics have a reflecting objective with a focal       length of 1200 mm and a detector which yields an       average angular resolution of 3 arcsec, i.e.  a       spatial resolution of the order of 150 m at the       nominal flyby distance of 10 000 km.  The maximum       angular dimension of the nucleus and its near       environment is expected to be 5 arcmin at closest       approach, and the pointing error is estimated to be       +/- 5 arcmin.  The field of view of the TVY must       therefore be not less than 15 arcmin.         The TDN has a refractory objective with a focal       length of 150 mm.  It is characterised by an       angular resolution of 0.5 arcmin, required for       early acquisition of the comet and its nucleus, and       a 2deg field of view imposed by the constraints       associated with control of the pointing platform.       The light collected by each telescope is divided       into two paths by a beam splitter, 0ne channel is       fitted with a fixed filter, the other has a set of       eight filters mounted on a rotating wheel, to yield       a spectral analysis of the signal.  The images are       forms on area CCDs cooled by a passive radiator       regulated by a Peltier plate.  The commutable       filters of the TDN have an additional function,       namely to adjust the amount of light collected by       the detector.  This channel is operated       autonomously and performs an independent analysis       of the video signal, thus providing redunant       information to the platform pointing system for the       sake of reliability.  The signals delivered by the       three other TDN and TVY channels are handled by the       same microprocessor system which analyses the       images and generates the commands that control the       motion of the platform.  The TVS electronics       include a 816 kbit memory to store both data and       programs, The main characteristics of the TVS are       given below.     ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Table .

Scientists wanted nucleus images with the highest       possible resolution, but that was limited by weight       considerations and by selecting a trajectory for       the spacecraft which was far enough away from the       nucleus to guarantee a high survival probability.       The compromise solution was to use a       Ritchey-Chretien type telescope for scientific       imaging with a focal length of 1200 mm, an       effective aperture of f/6.5, and a field of view of       26.4x39.6 arcmin.  It was immediately obvious that       the field of view of this narrow angle camera (NAC)       was too small to find the nucleus autonomously.  It       was also not possible to steer the telescope from       the ground because the position of the nucleus in       the coma was not well enough known.  Therefore, a       wide angle scanning camera (WAC) had to be added to       the payload.         A major concern was the target definition, namely       what should the pointing system be aimed at.  The       sensors could identify only the centre of       brightness, but it obviously was not identical to       the centre of the nucleus.  This was partly due to       partial illumination of the nucleus by the Sun       (comparable to the phases of the Moon) and partly       due to jet activity.  The pointing system might       well have locked on to a bright dust jet and be       steered away from the nucleus.  As we found no way       to define an offset reliably, we decided simply to       aim at the centre of brightness.  This targeting       strategy worked well for Vega.         The main navigation system for the platform was the       imaging system itself.  However, as a backup an       eight-segmented light sensitive sensor was mounted       on the pointing platform.  Its working principle       was extremely simple: if the centre of light from       the comet would move away from the centre of the       sensor, a change of the platform orientation would       have been initiated to compensate for this offset.       Fairly sophisticated computer simulations proved       that this backup was reliable, but fortunately, it       never had to be used.         To have many backups was a major element in our       design philosophy.  A third navigational backup,       which used analog signals from a completely       independent CCD sensor, was added to the TV system.       The output signal was processed in a similar way to       the eight segmented light sensitive sensor but with       much higher precision.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:vega2.ducma,DUST PARTICLE COUNTER AND MASS ANALYZER for VEGA2,DUST PARTICLE COUNTER AND MASS ANALYZER,"         Instrument Overview     ===================         The detector is a 28 Km thick film of polarised       polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), covered on each       face with a metallic conducting coating.  A dust       particle impacting the detector will displace a       small volume of polarised material in the bulk of       the detector, which then results in a fast       depolarisation signal whose amplitude is a known       function of the particle mass and velocity.       Electronic circuits measure the pulse height and       ac- cumulate pulse events above four different       threshold levels.  Since the relative impact       velocity is known (i.e.  the comet-spacecraft       velocity), the mass is determined direct- ly from       the known mass/velocity relationship for these       detectors.  The detector assembly consists of the       dust detector (M), and a small anti-coincidence       detector (V), mounted perpendicular to the       direction of arrival of the dust particles.  The       purpose of the small detector is to detect very       large mechanical shocks on the spacecraft which       might trigger the most sensitive level of the dust       detector.  Further technical details are given in       the table below, where the values for the       'differential dust mass ranges' are published in       Simpson et al.  'Ducma Measurements of Comet Halley       Dust Mass Spectra Bases on Post-Encounter Dust       Calibrations', Asteroids, Comets, and Meteors III       (1990, Uppsala).  This instrument was selected one       year before launch and could still be considered at       this late stage because it did not require any       direct telemetry or telecommand inter- face with       the spacecraft.  Its inclusion was facilitated       because it was allowed to share the data format and       telecommands initially allocated to the ING       instrument.    -----------------------------------------------------  Table.

Instrument Overview   ===================     The sensors of the MISCHA magnetometer are mounted on a boom. A     single-axis sensor and a triaxial sensor are mounted 1 and 2 m,     respectively, from the edge of the solar panel.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:vega2.pm1,PLASMA ENERGY ANALYZER for VEGA2,PLASMA ENERGY ANALYZER,"       Instrument Overview     ===================         The instrument includes six detectors: two ion       analysers, one electron analyser, two collectors       which measure the integral plasma ion flux, and one       sensor which monitors the integral electron current       produced from its surface by photon and particle       bom- bardment.  The ion detectors are designed for       the study of the energy distribution of the solar       and cometary particles, and not for the       investigation of their three- dimensional velocity       distribution.  Each sensor consists of a       quadripolar electrical lens (2), a hemispherical       plate analyser (3) and a channeltron (4).  The       energy spectrum is swept once per second by       stepping the bias voltage U(A) applied between the       plates.  The detector oriented towards the Sun has       a conical of view (1) with a half angle of 15deg,       wide enough to detect the solar wind both upstream       and downstream of the cometary bow shock.  The ion       detector oriented along the spacecraft-comet       velocity vector is intended for operation in the       innermost part of the coma, where the cometary ions       are expected to have thermal velocities that are       negligible with respect to their relative drift       velocity of 78 km/s.  This system can therefore be       used as a mass spectrometer in the range 1-110 amu       with a resolution m/delta m = 20; the minimum       measurable ion density is 10**-3/cm**3.  The       electron analyser has an aperture of 0.03 cm**2, an       angular resolu- tion of +/-2.5deg, and an energy       resolution of +/-5%; its geometrical factor is       10**-5 E (keV) (cm**2.sr.keV).  Its aperture is       oriented perpendicular to the Sun and relative-       velocity directions in order to eliminate       interferences generated by photon and particle       impacts.  The energy spectrum is scanned by       applying a series of logarithmically distributed       voltage steps U(A) to a cylindrical deflection unit       (1).  The entrance of the instrument is controlled       by a collimator (2) and a grid (3); the detector is       a channeltron (4).  The integral detector which       measures the solar-wind ions consists of a       collimator, a number of grids to limit the flux of       photoelectrons, and a collector.  A potential of       +3500 V is periodically applied to one of the grids       in order to stop the ion flux and evaluate the       interference background.  The aperture has an area       of 5 cm**2 and the dynamic range of the       measurements extends from +/- 10**-11 A to +/-       3x10**-9 A.  The integral detector, which is       aligned with the relative-velocity vector, has       similar features, but the electrodes are configured       such that the incoming dust par- ticles and neutral       molecules can only impact on the first diaphragm       and on the collec- tor.  By biasing the electrodes       differently, in an alternative configuration, it is       possible to discriminate between the cometary ions       and the charged particles produced by various       impact ionisation processes.  The impact plasma       monitor is a gold electrode, biased at a fixed       potential of -17 V, which measures the integral       flux of electrons emitted by the impact of neutral       gas, dust particles and photons, in the range       10**-10-3x10**-5 A.  The characteristics of the       various detectors are summarised in the table       below.      --------------------------------------------------------------------------  Table.

Grard, ESA/ESTEC, Noordwijk, The Netherlands)  A1 Faraday cup for measuring integral ion flux from solar direction,  A2 Faraday cup for measuring integral ion flux and neutral particles     from ram direction,  A3 spherical electrostatic analyzer for measuring ions from ram     direction in the energy range of 15 eV - 3.6 keV in 120     logarithmically spaced channels,  A4 spherical electrostatic analyzer for measuring ions from solar     direction in the energy range of 60 eV - 30 keV in 60     logarithmically spaced channels,  A5 cylindrical electrostatic analyzer for measuring ions perpendicular     to the ecliptic plane in the energy range of 2 eV - 10 keV in     30 logarithmically spaced channels.           Scientific objectives         The electrostatic ion analyzers A3 and A4 were       designed to study the change of the energy       distribution of the solar wind and cometary ions as       a function of the distance from the nucleus.  The       detector oriented in the ram direction could       determine the mass distribution of cometary ions       close to the nucleus with a resolution of       m/dm=20-25.  The ram Faraday cup A2 had four modes       of operation.  Two of these provided information on       the neutral particle flow from the comet.

Detectors A3 and A5 of Vega-1 were fatally damaged  during the cruise phase.  Detector A3 of Vega-2 was  fatally damaged 2.5 min before closest approach.  The channeltrons of A3 were saturating at higher count rates.    Calibration description    The sensors were calibrated at the Max-Planck-Institut  for Aeronomy in Katlenburg/Lindau, Germany. The viewing  angle and energy resolution of the electrostatic analyzers  were determined in vacuum chamber using monoenergetic  ion and electron beams, respectively.(For further details  see reference #3 above.)  The spectrometers used Soviet-made channeltrons as particle  detectors.An in-flight calibration was performed every day  to select the optimum voltage for the channeltrons.  A post-launch calibration was performed in order to correct  the saturating count rates of detector A3 of Vega-2 using the  integral fluxes provided by the ram Faraday cup A2.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:vega2.puma,DUST IMPACT MASS ANALYZER for VEGA2,DUST IMPACT MASS ANALYZER,"         Instrument Overview     ===================         The dust mass spectrometer measures the chemical       composition, the size and the spatial density of       solid particles using a time-of-flight technique,       with particular emphasis on the determination of       the Li, C and B isotopic ratios.  The operating       Principle of PUMA, illustrated in Figure 8a, is       similar to that of the PIA instrument flown on       Giotto.  The dust particles enter through a baffle       and impact on a silver target (M) at a speed of 78       km/s.  The particles and a certain amount of the       target material are vaporized and partly ionized.       The two Vega spacecraft have different targets; one       type is mounted in a cartridge as in the PIA, the       second has a corrugated surface such that a larger       amount of projectile ions enter the analyzer.  The       target is at + 1020 V; the ions are accelerated by       a grid (1), which is held at a potential of -2000       V, and enter the field-free drift tube at zero       potential (4).  These charged particles are sent by       the electrostatic reflector (5) into the second       drift tube (6) and on towards the detector (7).       The ions trajectories are focused by the lenses       (9), (10) and (11).  A set of three electrodes       (12), consisting of an inner grid at +1000 V       between two grids at zero potential, prevents ions       with energies less than 1 keV from reaching the       detector.  The geometry of the reflector is       designed in such a way as to bunch ions of the same       species (particles with energies E>E(0) travel a       larger distance than those with energies E<E(0))       and to eliminate those with energies that deviate       too much from E(0).  The purpose of this mirror       system is to reduce the dispersion of the flight       times for particles having the same charge-to-mass       ratios.  The reflector potential is switch- between       1000 V and 1100 V every 30 s, in order to       compensate for the higher energies of ions created       by the impacts of larger particles.  The       time-of-flight is measured with reference to three       signals: the light flash recorded by the       photomultiplier (3), the pulses detected by the       target (M), and the accelerating grid (1).  The       signals induced in these sensors, in the first lens       (9), in the ejecta trap (8) and in the detector       (7), which are illustrated qualitatively in Figure       8c, are used to characterize the mass of the       particles.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:vega2.sp1,DUST IMPACT PLASMA DETECTOR for VEGA2,DUST IMPACT PLASMA DETECTOR,"         Instrument Overview     ===================         This instrument detects the electric charges       contained in the plasma cloud generated by a solid       particle impacting on a gold target.  The principle       of this technique is similar to that adopted for       the impact plasma detectors of SP-2.  The magnitude       of the positive and negative charges is       proportional to the mass of the particle Q=Am,       where A= 10**3C/s for an impact velocity of 78       km/s.  The SP-1 system includes two similar       detectors.  Each unit is made up of a base plate       (1) covered by a gold target (2) at zero potential,       perpendicular to the dust flow, and an array of       strip collectors (4).  The collectors are parallel       to the dust flow; they are mounted on an insulator       (3) and their edge is protected from impacts by a       shield (5) connected electrically to the structure.       Adjacent collectors are biased at potentials of 30       V, with opposite polarities.  The two sets of       electrodes in each detector detect a positive and a       negative current pulse, which are analysed and       recorded by the electronics unit.  The entrance to       one detector is covered by a plastic foil, to       obtain additional information on density and/or       calibration factor.  The characteristic parameters       of SP-1 are given in Table 8.          Table 8.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:vega2.sp2,DUST PARTICLE DETECTOR for VEGA2,DUST PARTICLE DETECTOR,"         Instrument Overview     ===================         The acoustical detector consists of three       piezo-electric elements mounted on a mem- brane       (3), two of these sensors (4) are connected to two       identical recording circuits in order to improve       the overall reliability of the system; the third       element (5) is used as a stimuli source for       calibration purposes.  The membrane is mounted in a       frame (l) which damps the mechanical oscillations       and improves the counting rate.  The detector       assembly is fixed to the electronics box (6) by       means of three acoustical insulators (2).  Each       piezo-electric element delivers a signal which is       fed into a narrow-band amplifier working at a       frequency of about 160 kHz.  The output signal is       split into l6 channels, which have their       sensitivity thresholds logarithmically distributed       across the whole dynamic range.  Four identical       impact plasma detectors are mounted at the       periphery of the acoustical detector.  They are       associated in pairs and connected to identical       electronic circuits.  The entrance to each detector       is protected against the environmental plasma by a       system of deflecting electrodes and grids (7,8).       The ions and electrons generated by each particle       impact are separated and collected by a grid (9)       and a target (10), bet- ween which a potential       difference of 2 kV is applied.  The electron pulse       detected by the lower electrode constitutes the       input signal, which is analysed in several channels       with different sensitivity thresholds.  The       threshold sensitivity of the dust particle acoustic       detector in terms of the transferred momentum is       given by Pmin ~ 2x10**-5 gcm/s.  Taking into       account that the recoil momentum may exceed the       particle momentum mV by 5 to 10 times, the minimum       mass of recorded particles is < 3x10**-13 g.  The       measurement range n (> m)x3x10**-13 to ~ 2x10**-6 g       is divided into 16 channels.  With the relative       width delta/m ~ 2.82, sensitive area S = 500 cm**2,       accumulation time for one spectrum is 1 s, which       corresponds to the spatial resolution ~ 80 km over       the flyby trajectory.  The counting rate of small       mass particles is about 4095 1/s.  The ionization       detector is capable of recording particles with       mass 3x10**-16 to 3x10**-11g.  The number of       channels is 6, with relative width delta/m = 10,       sensitive area - 40 cm**2.  The limit counting rate       of small mass particles is ~ 65,500 1/s.  The       accumulation time for one spectrum is 1 s.  The       characteristic features of SP-2 are listed in the       table below.     ------------------------------------------------------------------- Table.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:vega2.tvs,TELEVISION SYSTEM for VEGA2,TELEVISION SYSTEM,"         Instrument Overview     ===================         The television system consists of two telescopes,       one narrow-angle camera (TVY) for high-resolution       imaging of the nucleus, and one large-angle camera       (TDN) for detecting and tracking the comet.  The       TVY optics have a reflecting objective with a focal       length of 1200 mm and a detector which yields an       average angular resolution of 3 arcsec, i.e.  a       spatial resolution of the order of 150 m at the       nominal flyby distance of 10 000 km.  The maximum       angular dimension of the nucleus and its near       environment is expected to be 5 arcmin at closest       approach, and the pointing error is estimated to be       +/- 5 arcmin.  The field of view of the TVY must       therefore be not less than 15 arcmin.         The TDN has a refractory objective with a focal       length of 150 mm.  It is characterised by an       angular resolution of 0.5 arcmin, required for       early acquisition of the comet and its nucleus, and       a 2deg field of view imposed by the constraints       associated with control of the pointing platform.       The light collected by each telescope is divided       into two paths by a beam splitter, 0ne channel is       fitted with a fixed filter, the other has a set of       eight filters mounted on a rotating wheel, to yield       a spectral analysis of the signal.  The images are       forms on area CCDs cooled by a passive radiator       regulated by a Peltier plate.  The commutable       filters of the TDN have an additional function,       namely to adjust the amount of light collected by       the detector.  This channel is operated       autonomously and performs an independent analysis       of the video signal, thus providing redunant       information to the platform pointing system for the       sake of reliability.  The signals delivered by the       three other TDN and TVY channels are handled by the       same microprocessor system which analyses the       images and generates the commands that control the       motion of the platform.  The TVS electronics       include a 816 kbit memory to store both data and       programs, The main characteristics of the TVS are       given below.       ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Table .

Scientists wanted nucleus images with the highest       possible resolution, but that was limited by weight       considerations and by selecting a trajectory for       the spacecraft which was far enough away from the       nucleus to guarantee a high survival probability.       The compromise solution was to use a       Ritchey-Chretien type telescope for scientific       imaging with a focal length of 1200 mm, an       effective aperture of f/6.5, and a field of view of       26.4x39.6 arcmin.  It was immediately obvious that       the field of view of this narrow angle camera (NAC)       was too small to find the nucleus autonomously.  It       was also not possible to steer the telescope from       the ground because the position of the nucleus in       the coma was not well enough known.  Therefore, a       wide angle scanning camera (WAC) had to be added to       the payload.         A major concern was the target definition, namely       what should the pointing system be aimed at.  The       sensors could identify only the centre of       brightness, but it obviously was not identical to       the centre of the nucleus.  This was partly due to       partial illumination of the nucleus by the Sun       (comparable to the phases of the Moon) and partly       due to jet activity.  The pointing system might       well have locked on to a bright dust jet and be       steered away from the nucleus.  As we found no way       to define an offset reliably, we decided simply to       aim at the centre of brightness.  This targeting       strategy worked well for Vega.         The main navigation system for the platform was the       imaging system itself.  However, as a backup an       eight-segmented light sensitive sensor was mounted       on the pointing platform.  Its working principle       was extremely simple: if the centre of light from       the comet would move away from the centre of the       sensor, a change of the platform orientation would       have been initiated to compensate for this offset.       Fairly sophisticated computer simulations proved       that this backup was reliable, but fortunately, it       never had to be used.         To have many backups was a major element in our       design philosophy.  A third navigational backup,       which used analog signals from a completely       independent CCD sensor, was added to the TV system.       The output signal was processed in a similar way to       the eight segmented light sensitive sensor but with       much higher precision.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:vg1.crs,COSMIC RAY SUBSYSTEM for VG1,COSMIC RAY SUBSYSTEM,"       Instrument Overview   ===================     As its name implies, the Cosmic Ray Subsystem (CRS) was     designed for cosmic ray studies [STONEETAL1977B].  It consists     of two high Energy Telescopes (HET), four Low Energy Telescopes     (LET) and The Electron Telescope (TET).  The detectors have     large geometric factors (~ 0.48 to 8 cm^2 ster) and long     electronic time constants (~ 24 [micro]sec) for low power     consumption and good stability.  Normally, the data are     primarily derived from comprehensive ([Delta]E[1], [Delta]E[2]     and E) pulse- height information about individual events.     Because of the high particle fluxes encountered at Jupiter and     Saturn, greater reliance had to be placed on counting rates in     single detectors and various coincidence rates.  In     interplanetary space, guard counters are placed in     anticoincidence with the primary detectors to reduce the     background from high-energy particles penetrating through the     sides of the telescopes.  These guard counters were turned off     in the Jovian magnetosphere when the accidental anticoincidence     rate became high enough to block a substantial fraction of the     desired counts.  Fortunately, under these conditions the     spectra were sufficiently soft that the background, due to     penetrating particles, was small.       The data on proton and ion fluxes at Jupiter were obtained with     the LET.  The thicknesses of individual solid-state detectors     in the LET and their trigger thresholds were chosen such that,     even in the Jovian magnetosphere, electrons made, at most, a     very minor contribution to the proton counting rates     [LUPTON&STONE1972].  Dead time corrections and accidental     coincidences were small (< 20%) throughout most of the     magnetotail, but were substantial (> 50%) at flux maxima within     40 R[J] Of Jupiter.  Data have been included in this package     for those periods when the corrections are less than ~ 50% and     can be corrected by the user with the dead time appropriate to     the detector (2 to 25 [micro]sec).  The high counting rates,     however, caused some baseline shift which may have raised     proton thresholds significantly.  In the inner magnetosphere,     the L[2] counting rate was still useful because it never rolled     over.  This rate is due to 1.8- to 13-MeV protons penetrating     L[1] (0.43 cm^2 ster) and > 9-MeV protons penetrating the     shield (8.4 cm^2 ster).  For an E^-2 spectrum, the two groups     would make comparable contributions; but in the magnetosphere,     for the E^-3 to E^-4 spectrum above 2.5 MeV [MCDONALDETAL1979],     the contribution from protons penetrating the shield would be     only 3 to 14%.       The LET L[1]L[2]L[4] and L[1]L[2]L[3] coincidence-     anticoincidence rates give the proton flux between 1.8 and 8     MeV and 3 to 8 MeV with a small alpha particle contribution (~     10^-3).  Corrections are required for dead time losses in L[1],     accidental L[1]L[2] coincidences and anticoincidence losses     from L[4].  Data are given only for periods when these     corrections are relatively small.  The energy lost in detectors     L[1], L[2] and L[3] was measured for individual particles.  For     protons, this covered the energy range from 0.42 to 8.3 MeV.     Protons can be identified positively by the [Delta]E vs.  E     technique, their spectra obtained and accidental coincidences     greatly reduced.  Because of telemetry limitations, however,     only a small fraction of the events could be transmitted, and     statistics become poor unless pulse-height data are averaged     over a period of one hour.       HET and LET detectors share the same data lines and pulse-     height analyzers; thus, the telescopes can interfere with one     another during periods of high counting rates.  To prevent such     an interference and explore different coincidence conditions,     the experiment was cycled through four operating modes, each     192 seconds long.  Either the HETs or the LETs were turned on     at a time.  LET-D was cycled through L[1] only and L[1]L[2]     coincidence requirements.  The TET was cycled through various     coincidence conditions, including singles from the front     detectors.  At the expense of some time resolution, this     procedure permitted us to obtain significant data in the outer     magnetosphere and excellent data during the long passage     through the magnetotail region.  Some of the published results     from this experiment required extensive corrections for dead     time, accidental coincidences and anticoincidences     ([VOGTETAL1979A], [VOGTETAL1979B]; [SCHARDTETAL1981];     [GEHRELSETAL1981]).  These corrections can be applied only on a     case-by-case basis after a careful study of the environment and     many self-consistency checks.  They cannot be applied on a     systematic basis and we have no computer programs to do so;     therefore, data from such periods are not included in the Data     Center submission.  The scientists on the CRS team will,     however, be glad to consider special requests if the desired     information can be extracted from the data.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:vg1.eng,Voyager 1 Spacecraft Sensors,Voyager 1 Engineering,"             The aggregation of spacecraft sensors on the Voyager 1 spacecraft.                                                             The Voyager 1 spacecraft was built by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).                       Its mass was 815 kilograms, including its own power, propulsion, and                             communications systems and its own science instruments.                                Spacecraft electrical power was supplied by Radioisotope                               Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs) that produced about 400 watts.                        The Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS),                                Computer Command Subsystem (CCS), and Flight Data Subsystem                            (FDS) managed spacecraft operations.  Thrusters and gyroscopes                             provided physical propulsion and attitude control.                                     Communications between the spacecraft and Earth were carried                           out via a high-gain radio antenna using both S-band and X-band                         frequencies at data rates as high as 115.2 kilobits per second.                        A Digital Tape Recorder (DTR) could save up to 500 million bits                        when no Earth station was available for real-time data                                 transmission.  Voyager control systems could record sets of                            several thousand instructions, allowing autonomous operation                           for days or weeks at a time.  Many of the systems were equipped             with sensors, which fed engineering data to the ground where             status and performance could be monitored.                          The spacecraft itself was built around its 'bus' -- a decagonal                        prism, which was about 2 meters in diameter and about 60 cm                            deep.  Each of the ten sides of the bus was associated with a                          'bay' containing engineering systems or science instrument                             electronics.  Bay 1, for example, contained the radio                                  transmitter.  The High-Gain Antenna (HGA) was mounted to the                           end of the bus facing Earth.  The bays were numbered 1 through                         10 in a clockwise direction when viewed from Earth.  Extending                         away from the bus were three booms: a science boom and scan                            platform to which most instruments were mounted, a magnetometer                        boom, and a boom to which the RTGs were mounted.                                                    Spacecraft Coordinate System                                                           ----------------------------                                                           The centerline of the bus was the roll axis of the                                   spacecraft; it also served as the z-axis of the spacecraft                           coordinate system with the high-gain antenna (HGA) boresight                         defining the negative z-direction.  The HGA boresight was                            also defined as cone angle 0 degrees and as azimuth 180                              degrees, elevation 7 degrees.  The science boom, supporting                          the scan platform, extended in the general direction of                              positive y; this boom was also defined as being at cone angle                        90 degrees, clock angle 215 degrees and at azimuth 180                               degrees, elevation 97 degrees.  The boom supporting the RTGs                           was mounted on the bus in generally the negative y direction.                        The positive y-axis (yaw axis) of the spacecraft coordinate                          system passed through Bay 3; the negative y-axis passed                              through Bay 8.  The x-axis (pitch axis) was in a direction                           which defined a right-handed rectangular coordinate system.                          The positive x-axis was at cone angle 90 degrees, clock angle                        305 degrees (azimuth 270 degrees, elevation 90 degrees).                                          Telecommunications Subsystem                                                           ----------------------------                                                           The high-gain antenna was mounted to the spacecraft bus,                             pointing in the negative z-direction.  It was a parabolic                            reflector 3.7 meters in diameter with a feed that permitted                          simultaneous operation at both S-band (13 cm wavelength) and                         X-band (3.6 cm).  The half-power full-width of the antenna                           beam was 0.6 degrees at X-band and 2.3 degrees at S-band.                            The Low-Gain Antenna (LGA) was mounted on the feed structure                         of the HGA and radiated approximately uniformly over the                             hemisphere into which the HGA pointed.                                                            The Telecommunications Subsystem (TCS) electronics included a                        redundant pair of transponders, meaning that a failed                                functional unit in one transponder could be bypassed by                              swapping to the redundant unit.  The TCS could transmit                              science data on the X-band link at rates between 4.8 and                             115.2 kilobits per second and engineering data on the S-band                         link at 40 bits per second.  It could receive instructions                           sent (uplinked) from ground stations at a rate of 16 bits per                        second.  Commands were extracted from the uplink signal by                           the Command Detector Unit (CDU) and were then sent to the                            Computer Command Subsystem (CCS).                                                                 Spacecraft receivers were designed to lock to the uplink                             signal.  Without locking, Doppler effects -- resulting from                          relative motion of the spacecraft and ground station -- could                        result in loss of the radio link as the frequency of the                             received signal drifted.                                               Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem                                            -------------------------------------------                                            The Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS)                               provided three-axis-stabilized control so that the spacecraft                        could maintain a fixed orientation in space.  Attitude                               control was accomplished using gyroscopes or by celestial                            reference.  The AACS also controlled motion of the scan                              platform, upon which the four 'remote sensing' instruments                           were mounted.                                                                                     Gyro control was used in special situations (e.g., trajectory                        corrections and solar conjunctions) for periods of up to                             several days.  The inertial reference unit operated with                             tuned rotor gyros having an uncalibrated drift rate of less                          than 0.5 degrees per hour and a calibrated drift rate of less                        than 0.05 degrees per hour.                                                                       Celestial control was based on viewing the Sun (through a                            sensor mounted on the high-gain antenna) and a single bright                         star (through a second sensor named the Canopus Star Tracker,                        after the star used most frequently as the reference).  When                         the spacecraft attitude drifted by more than a small amount                          from the reference objects, the AACS fired small thrusters                           which returned the spacecraft to the proper orientation.  The                        Sun sensor was an optical potentiometer with a cadmium                               sulfide detector; its error was less than 0.01 degrees and                           its limit cycle was +/-0.05 degrees.  The Canopus Star                               Tracker was an image dissector tube with a cesium detector,                          an error of less than 0.01 degree, and a limit cycle of                              +/-0.05 degrees.                                                                                  Redundant (backup) sun sensors, star trackers, and computers                         were also part of the AACS.  The non-redundant portions of                           the AACS were those controlling the pointing of the                                  instrument scan platform, which had two degrees of freedom --                        elevation and azimuth (see below).                          Propulsion Subsystem                                                                   --------------------                                                                   The propulsion system was part of the AACS and consisted of                          16 hydrazine thrusters.  These thrusters were also used to                           control the three-axis stabilization of the spacecraft.  Two                         thrusters on opposite sides of the spacecraft were used to                           perform positive roll turns around the +Z axis.  Two                                 oppositely pointed thrusters were used to perform negative                           roll turns.  One thruster was used to perform positive yaw                           turns (around the +Y axis) and one was used to perform                               negative yaw turns.  One thruster was used to perform                                positive pitch turns (around the +X axis) and one was used to                        perform negative pitch turns.  A backup hydrazine system was                         connected to a redundant set of eight thrusters.                                                  Power Subsystem                                                                        ---------------                                                                        Spacecraft power was provided by three Radioisotope                                  Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs) mounted on a boom in the                            negative y-direction.  At Launch the three RTGs converted                            7000 watts of heat into 475 watts of electrical power.  RTG                          electrical output decreased by about 7 watts per year because                        of decay of the plutonium dioxide fissionable material and                           degradation of the silicon-germanium thermocouples.  The                             difference between available electrical power and the power                          required to operate spacecraft subsystems was called the                             'power margin.' Voyager Project guidelines required a power                          margin of at least 12 watts to guard against electrical                              transients and miscalculations; excess electrical power was                          dissipated as heat in a shunt radiator.                                                           Data Storage Subsystem                                                                 ----------------------                                                                 The Digital Tape Recorder (DTR) was used to store data when                          real-time communications with Earth were either not possible                         or not scheduled.  The DTR recorded data on eight tracks;                            rates were 115.2 kilobits per second (record only), 21.6                             kilobits per second (playback only), and 7.2 kilobits per                            second (record and playback).  Capacity of each track was 12                         images or equivalent.                                                                             Computer Command Subsystem                                                             --------------------------                                                             The Computer Command Subsystem (CCS) consisted of two                                identical computer processors, their software algorithms, and                        associated electronic hardware.  The CCS was the central                             controller of the spacecraft.  During most of the Voyager                            mission the two CCS computers on each spacecraft were used                           non-redundantly to increase the command and processing                               capability of the spacecraft.                                                                     Flight Data Subsystem                                                                  ---------------------                                                                  The Flight Data Subsystem (FDS) consisted of two                                     reprogrammable digital computers and associated encoding                             hardware.  The FDS collected and formatted science and                               engineering telemetry data for transmission to Earth.                                Convolutional coding was imposed on all data transmitted from                        the spacecraft.  Additionally, both Golay encoding and Reed-                         Solomon encoding were available for use on spacecraft data.                          Data compression was also performed within the FDS.                                               Science Boom                                                                           ------------                                                                           The Voyager science instrument boom carried the plasma                               detector, cosmic ray detector and the low energy charged                             particle detector.  The scan platform was mounted on the                             science boom.                                                                                     Scan Platform                                                                          -------------                                                                          Four instruments (Imaging, PhotoPolarimeter, Infra-Red                               Interferometric Spectrometer, and Ultra Violet Spectrometer)                         were mounted on the scan platform, which could be slewed by                          motors and gears (called actuators).  Elevation of the scan                          platform was measured with respect to a plane slightly offset                        (by approximately 7 degrees) from the spacecraft x-z plane;                          the spacecraft positive y-axis was at 97 degrees elevation                           (see Spacecraft Coordinate System above).  The scan platform                         azimuth reference was defined by the y-z plane, with zero                            azimuth being in the negative z-direction.  Drive actuators                          were controlled by fine feedback potentiometers; the error of                        each was less than 0.03 degrees, and the final pointing error                        of the scan platform was nominally +/-0.1 degrees (2-sigma                           per axis).  Subsequent analysis by the Navigation and                                Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF) at JPL showed larger                        errors during at least the Jupiter and Saturn encounters.                            High rate slews of 1 deg/sec were discontinued after the                             azimuth drive mechanism on Voyager 2 temporarily froze a                             short time after Saturn closest approach.  The medium slew                           rate was 0.33 deg/sec, and the low slew rate was 0.08                                deg/sec.

One low-field magnetometer was mounted at the end of                        the boom and a second was mounted about 3 meters from the                            end.  Two high-field magnetometers were mounted at the base                          of the boom.

The two components of the instrument share a 50 cm       Cassegrain telescope with an effective focal length of 303.5       cm.  The angular field of view is 0.25 degree.  Light passing       through the telescope is divided into two beams by a dichroic       mirror, with that longer than about 2.5 micrometers going to       the infrared interferometer and radiation between 0.33 and 2       micrometers going to the radiometer.  The effective spectral       range of the interferometer is 180-2500 cm**-1 (4-55       micrometers) and the apodized spectral resolution is 4.3       cm**-1.  The beam splitter of the interferometer consists of a       multilayer dielectric coating applied to a cesium iodide       substrate.  The moving mirror is mounted on one end of a motor       shaft; the moving mirror of an auxiliary reference       interferometer is attached to the other end of the shaft.  A       0.5852 micrometer neon line source is used for the reference       interferometer; the signal from this unit is used by a phase       comparator and digital sampling circuit to control the motor       speed and to quantize the analog signal from the main IR       detector.  The latter is a low impedance, Schwartz-type       thermopile with a noise equivalent power (NEP) of about 2E-10       Watt/Hz**1/2.         The spectral response of the radiometer, which is designed to       measure the broadband reflected solar radiation, is controlled       by the dichroic mirror and an additional coating on the       radiometer side of the mirror.  The radiometer detector is an       eighteen-junction thermopile with an NEP of 4E-10 Watt/Hz**1/2.       A sapphire window is placed in front of the detector to reject       unwanted long-wave radiation that may result from temperature       gradients within the instrument.  The signal from the       radiometer detector is fed to a low noise, low-drift dc       amplifier with a time constant of approximately 2.7 seconds,       and then to three different output circuits.  The first circuit       integrates the radiometer signal over the 45.6 seconds it takes       to record an interferogram, thus providing the average of the       reflected sunlight during the time the infrared spectrum is       recorded.  The second and third circuits provide the analog       signal from the radiometer as well as the signal amplified by a       factor of 8.  These latter channels are sampled every 6 seconds       and digitized.  The timing of the samples, and their       relationship to events in a single-frame read out of an image       are given in Table 1.                        Table 1.

The       relationships are:               For Voyager 1:                  Sampled data (normal gain):                   DNn = (WADn * 1e+08 - 2.51937) / 3.39426                Sampled data (high gain):                   DNh = (WADh * 1e+09 - 1.55472) / 4.26206                Integrated data:                   DNi = WADi / 1.42145 * 1e+09               For Voyager 2:                  Sampled data (normal gain):                   DNn = (WADn * 1e+08 - 6.33020) / 3.40070                Sampled data (high gain):                   DNh = (WADh * 1e+09 + 6.57589) / 4.24459                Integrated data:                   DNi = WADi / 1.42047 * 1e+09           Pairs of baseline levels are averaged at the beginning and at       the end of the 45.6 second integrations, occasionally resulting       in half-integral DN values for the integrated radiometer data.         Despite the stability of the calibration data (see below), a       small systematic error may remain.  Comparison of spatially       resolved IRIS observations of Jupiter and Saturn shows that       reflectivities derived from Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 IRIS       instruments are in the ratio 0.883:1.  An investigation was       made of albedos of various objects (Jupiter, Io, Ganymede,       Callisto, and Saturn), as determined using the two instruments.       When compared to groundbased determinations, no systematic       differences were apparent for either instrument, within the       uncertainties.  Thus, a systematic error on the order of 10%       may exist in the calibration of one or both of the IRIS       instruments' radiometer systems.         The temperature of the instrument is passively and actively       controlled to operate at 200 +/- 0.5 K with a maximum drift of       +/- 0.1 K/day.  A thermal radiator mounted on the       interferometer cools the instrument by radiating to deep space.       Three sets of proportionally controlled heaters provide fine       thermal control for the primary telescope mirror, secondary       mirror, and the interferometer.  It is necessary to maintain       temperature differences between the three components to less       than 0.1 K.  In addition, high-powered 'flash-off' heaters are       available for increasing the instrument temperature by       approximately 70 K.  These are controlled by command.  These       have been used to warm the instrument during cruise periods to       reverse a gradual change in the elastic properties of a       silicone compound in the Michelson motor dampers and       beam-splitter mounts.         Science Objectives     ==================       The scientific objectives of the Voyager Infrared       Interferometer Spectrometer (IRIS) investigation include the       following:        (1)  Identification and determination of the abundances of           gaseous atmospheric constituents;      (2)  Determination of the helium abundance of the           atmospheres of the giant planets;      (3)  Determination of the energy balances of the giant           planets through measurements of their total thermal           emissions and Bond albedos;      (4)  Determination of the three dimensional thermal           structure of the atmospheres of the giant planets and           Titan;      (5)  Inference of information on atmospheric dynamics;      (6)  Inference of the infrared optical properties of           clouds and hazes;      (7)  Determination of the temperature, composition, and           structure of the surfaces of satellites without           atmospheres;      (8)  Determination of the thermal characteristics of           Saturn's rings.         These objectives are accomplished through the analysis of       measurements of thermal emission spectra and broad band       reflected solar energy.         Operational Considerations     ==========================       The IRIS instruments on Voyager 1 and 2 operated normally       throughout the mission.  The infrared interferometers of both       instruments experienced a temporal decrease in responsivity,       believed to be due to a gradual stiffening in silicon compounds       used in the mirror mounts and motor dampers.  However, this was       partially reversed by using the flash off heaters to raise the       temperature of the instrument periodically during cruise       between encounters.         Calibration Description     =======================       In-flight calibration of the data from the interferometer is       accomplished using periodic observations of deep space along       with a precise knowledge of the instrument cavity temperature.       Use of the instrument temperature itself as a calibration point       was necessitated because the large size of the telescope made       the use of an on-board blackbody target impractical.         The calibration is carried out for each wavenumber interval       independently using I = B*(Tinst)*(C2 C1)/C2 where I is the       calibrated planetary radiance, B*(Tinst) is the Planck radiance       at the instrument temperature Tinst, and C2 and C1 are the       spectral amplitudes measured while observing the planet and       deep space, respectively.  This calibration technique requires       that the interferometer and all elements within its field of       view, including the telescope mirrors, apertures, and baffles,       be at precisely the same temperature.  This condition is       insured through the use of thermostatically controlled heaters.       To minimize systematic errors from possible small changes in       the instrument responsivity, the calibration must be updated as       a function of time during the encounter.         During an encounter, the deep space spectra for each day were       averaged and a time corresponding to the average time was       assigned to each average.  In addition to the daily averages, a       grand average of all deep space spectra was calculated.  For       each day a ratio spectrum consisting of the daily average power       spectrum divided by the grand average power spectrum was used       to scale the grand average instrument response to obtain the       daily response.  Individual spectra were then calibrated using       a linear interpolation.  The calibrated spectral radiances are       expressed in Watt/cm**2/sr/cm**-1.         Radiometer calibration consists of a verification of instrument       stability by repeated determinations of t(target plate), based       on observations of a diffusely scattering target plate mounted       on the spacecraft.  The calibration conversion to Watts at the       detector takes into account the detector response and       electrical gains.  Observations of the target plate were       carried out before and after each encounter with the exception       of after the Voyager 2 Saturn encounter when jamming of the       instrument scan platform caused the maneuver to be aborted.         The long term behavior of the target calibration data for the       two IRIS radiometers is presented in the following tables.  The       observed target signal, corrected for offsets, and normalized       for changes in heliocentric distance, has remained constant       within quantization uncertainties throughout the mission.  In       the absence of compensating changes in the target plate and the       instrument, this implies excellent radiometer stability.  The       arithmetic average of all target measurements, with a 1.5%       uncertainty, is adopted as the normalized target signal for       purposes of absolute calibration: 30960 +/- 460 DNi x AU**2;       this differs slightly from the published value 31152 +/- 312       DNi x AU**2 [PEARL&CONRATH1991].  The target signals for the       integrating, x8 sampling, and x1 sampling radiometer data are       in the ratio 24:8:1.       Table 2.

[2] Considers the larger of 0.5% (estimated maximum possible         nonlinearity) or the baseline variation as the         uncertainty.     [3] All uncertainties are considered uncorrelated in         calculation of the adjusted target signal.     [4] For Voyager 2 only, the adopted mean value of 30960 +/-         460 is entered for all cases in the calibration files.     [5] For Voyager 2 Saturn post-encounter, the instrument         platform jammed so the calibration maneuver was aborted.           Because the spectral transmission of the radiometer is not flat       across the bandwidth, further calibration requires knowledge of       the relative spectrum of each object observed.  The absolute       reflectance of the Voyager 1 and 2 target plates are 0.502 +/-       0.018 and 0.497 +/- 0.018, respectively.  A detailed       description of a technique for calibrating the radiometer is       given in [HANELETAL1981A].         Instrument Detectors     ====================       The detector of the broadband reflected solar radiometer is an       eighteen-junction thermopile with a 3 second thermal time       constant and is operated at a temperature of 200 K.  The       thermopile used with the broadband radiometer has a noise       equivalent power of 4E-10 Watt/Hz**1/2.         The detector of the infrared interferometer is a low-impedance       Schwartz-type four-junction thermopile with a thermal time       constant of 12 millisecond.  and is operated at a temperature       of 200 K.  The thermopile used with the interferometer has a       noise equivalent power of approximately 2E-10 Watt/Hz**1/2.         Instrument Electronics     ======================       The bulk of the analog and all of the digital circuitry is       located in an electronics module separate form the       interferometer module.  The power supply is located in still       another box.  Only elements that had to be close to detectors       to minimize noise, such as the sensors for temperature       measurements and controls, were located in the optics module.       The electronics box contains timing and control elements,       mirror drive circuitry, housekeeping monitors, thermal       controllers, analog-to-digital converters, and spacecraft       interface circuits.  The power module contains one primary and       two auxiliary power supplies that convert spacecraft primary ac       into dc voltages required to operate the instrument.  One of       the auxiliary supplies is always on to maintain the instrument       at the proper temperature.  The primary power supply is on only       when the instrument is on during tests, calibrations and       observation periods during planetary encounters.  Because of       the requirement to pass through the Jovian radiation       environment, hardened electronics components were used where       possible.  The bulk of the instrument electronics consists of       radiation-hardened integrated circuits.  A description of the       electronics, along with a block diagram, is given in       [HANELETAL1980A].         Instrument Optics     =================       The Cassegrain telescope has a parabolic primary mirror 50 cm       in diameter with a 7.62 cm hyperbolic secondary mirror, and an       effective focal length of 303.5 cm and an F number of 6.07.  A       dichroic mirror divides the beam from the telescope into two       separate beams, one going to the infrared interferometer and       the other to the broadband reflected solar radiometer.  The       telescope mirrors and support structure, like most of the other       mechanical parts of the instrument, are made of optical-grade       beryllium.  The primary mirror is gold coated over a nickel       plating.  The secondary mirror has an aluminum coating over the       nickel plating, and this in turn is overcoated with silicon       monoxide for protection.         Instrument Offset     =================       The instrument and the associated electronics and power supply       modules are bolted to the scan platform.  The telescope is       approximately bore-sighted with the wide and narrow angle       television cameras, and with the PPS and UVS instruments.         Instrument Parameters     =====================       The following instrument parameters are measured.         Sampled Visible Radiance - Series of 8 radiometer samples taken       during a 48 second data frame with the high gain channel.  The       quantity given is power at the detector in Watts.  (-1.0       indicates data off the planet).         Integrated Visable Radiance - The broadband, reflected solar       radiometer signal integrated over the 45.6 seconds that IRIS       data are taken within the 48 second data frame.  The quantity       given is power at the detector in Watts.         Thermal Radiance - Radiance (W cm-2 ster-1) within a 4.3 cm-1       spectral interval.         Instrument Modes     ================       The instrument possesses only one operating mode.  When turned       on the instruments acquires one interferogram every 48 second       data frame.  In addition data from the reflected solar       radiometer are also obtained every data frame.  The latter       consist of a measurement integrated over 45.6 seconds as well       as 8 samples of both high and normal gain measurements       distributed at 6 second intervals throughout the data frame.

The system consists of two       cameras, a high resolution Narrow Angle (NA) camera and a lower       resolution, more sensitive Wide Angle (WA) camera.  Unlike the       other on board instruments, operation of the cameras is not       autonomous, but is controlled by an imaging parameter table       residing in one of the spacecraft computers, the Flight Data       Subsystem (FDS) (Science and Mission Systems Handbook, 1987,       JPL D-498, an internal JPL document available from the JPL       vellum files).         The original mission was to Jupiter and Saturn.  Voyager       surpassed expectations and went on to encounter Uranus and       Neptune.  As the Voyager mission progressed the objects       photographed were further from the sun so they appear more       faint even though longer exposures were used.  As the Voyager       spacecrafts' distance from the Earth increases, the       telecommunications capability at each encounter decreases.  The       difference in capabilities from the Jupiter and Saturn       encounters and that at Uranus and Neptune was considerable.       The reduced telecommunications capability limits the number of       data modes that imaging can use.  Because of the diminished       brightness of the objects being photographed, longer exposure       times were used, many beyond the stated maximum of 15.360       seconds.  Longer exposure times were all 48-second increments       added to the maximum.  In addition, the camera was slewed in       order to avoid smeared imaging.  The light flood state (on/off)       was independent of the instrument mode.         Science Objectives     ==================       The overall objective of this experiment is exploratory       reconnaissance of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and their       satellites and rings.  Such reconnaissance, at resolutions and       phase angles unobtainable from Earth, provides much new data       relevant to the atmospheric and/or surface properties of these       bodies.  The experiment also has the following specific       objectives: observe and characterize global circulation and       meteorology; determine the horizontal and vertical structure of       visible clouds; characterize the nature of any colored material       which may be in clouds.         Operational Considerations     ==========================       To make full scientific use of the imaging collection, it is       necessary to understand the radiometric and geometric       characteristics of the camera system and perform corrections to       the data.         Each Voyager camera is unique in terms of its calibrated       characteristics.  Each has intrinsic shading (spatially       non-uniform output DNs from flat field target) and exhibits       barrel distortions typical of TV cameras flown on previous       planetary missions.  Because of these characteristics, the       cameras were calibrated before launch.  The response of the       pixels to known targets, illumination, exposures, etc.  was       measured and Calibration Files were generated to remove       radiometric an geometric distortions from the flight images.       These Calibration Files and detailed information on their use       are available through the Imaging Node.         Calibration Description     =======================       The calibration program for the Voyager television cameras       consisted of three parts: (1) component calibrations ('Voyager       Imaging Science Subsystem Calibration Report' July 31, 1978, M.       Benesh and P.  Jepsen, D618-802); (2) subsystem calibrations;       and, (3) system calibrations.  Component calibrations were       carried out prior to camera assembly.  Important measurements       include spectral transmittance of the lens and filters, actual       exposure times and shading characteristics of the shutter, and       pertinent electro-optical properties of the vidicon.  After the       optics and sensor were assembled it was possible to run       calibrations at the camera, or subsystem, level.  Particular       activities accomplished during this period included radiometric       calibrations, focal length measurement, determination of the       modulation transfer function, measurement of the geometric       distortion, and calibrations required for color reconstruction.       System calibrations were conducted after the cameras were       installed on the spacecraft.  Important tasks included       measurement of the Field-Of-View (FOV) alignment and       verification of the flat-field light transfer characteristics.       Noise measurements were also made at the system level.         A method for in-flight verification of the radiometric       calibrations that were run on the ground is employed on the       Narrow-Angle optics.  It is very similar to the scheme used on       the Wide-Angle optics except that eight lamps are required.       They are located just within the Field-Of-View around the       periphery of the telescope aperture.  By either pulsing the       lamps or leaving them on and varying the shutter exposure time       a transfer curve may also be generated by using the calibration       plaque.  The method is identical to that described for the       wide-angle optics.  However, calibration data was collected but       no new calibration files were generated during the Jupiter,       Saturn, or Uranus encounters or their related cruise periods.         Although the INSTRUMENT_PARAMETER_NAME has been provided as       Radiance, the Voyager Experiment Data Record (EDR) data set has       not been radiometrically corrected, and thus images do not       represent radiance units.  In order to convert an image from       Data Number (DN) to radiance units, the image must be       calibrated.  Radiometric calibration files, and selected       radiometrically corrected images are available through the       Imaging Node.

The         vidicon storage surface (target) is selenium sulphur and can         store a high resolution (1500 TV lines) picture for over 100         s at room temperature.  The active image area on the target         is 11.14 x 11.14 mm.  Each frame consists of 800 lines with         800 picture elements (pixels) per line, i.e., 1 pixel =14         microns.  One frame requires 48 s for electronic readout.  In         addition to the normal frame readout of 48 s (1:1), four         extended frame-time modes of 2:1, 3:1, 5:1, and 10:1 are         available by command.  Following readout, light flooding is         used to remove any residual image that might remain from the         previous frame.  At the end of light flooding, 14 erase         frames are used to stabilize and prepare the vidicon target         for the next exposure sequence (VGR ISS Calibration Report,         1978, an internal JPL document available from JPL vellum         files).           Sensitivity       -----------         Calibration experiments show the gain map indicating higher         sensitivity toward the top of the frame in a radial manner.         Dark-current ratio results indicate a mean within         plus-or-minus 3% of the true linearity of the light transfer         function.  The required accuracy of the light transfer         functions was plus-or-minus 5% of half-scale signal averaged         over any randomly selected area of 10 contiguous pixels.         This requirement was consistently met for all ISS flight         cameras.  The radiance of the used light cannons was supposed         to be plus-or-minus 5% or better of the level to produce a         half-scale signal.  This criterion was also met.  It is not         clear whether the color spatial dependence is due to the         vidicon, or whether the filters have varying transmissions.         In the latter case, the ratios would be independent of light         level; and this has been observed to be the case for all         flight cameras.  Moreover, vidicons have not shown scale         variations of this magnitude in the past, so that it is         easier to believe that they are due to the spectral filters         rather than to the vidicons.  The color sensitivity is         sufficient to require a separate decalibration file for each         spectral filter, which has been done, but not gross enough to         cause concern about the quality of the image itself (VGR ISS         Calibration Report, 1978, an internal JPL document available         from JPL vellum files).         Instrument Electronics 'ISSN'     =============================         Description       -----------         The Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) electronics consist of         the vidicon support circuits and the signal chain.  The         vidicon support circuits are the vertical and horizontal         sweep circuits, and the various power supplies for the         vidicon filament, and the focus and alignment coils.

The system consists of two       cameras, a high resolution Narrow Angle (NA) camera and a lower       resolution, more sensitive Wide Angle (WA) camera.  Unlike the       other on board instruments, operation of the cameras is not       autonomous, but is controlled by an imaging parameter table       residing in one of the spacecraft computers, the Flight Data       Subsystem (FDS) (Voyager Science and Mission Systems Handbook,       1987, JPL D-498, an internal JPL document available from JPL       vellum files).         The original mission was to Jupiter and Saturn.  Voyager       surpassed expectations and Voyager 2 went on to encounter       Uranus and Neptune.  As the Voyager mission progressed the       objects photographed were further from the sun so they appear       more faint even though longer exposures were used.  As the       Voyager spacecrafts' distance from the Earth increases, the       telecommunications capability at each encounter decreases.  The       difference in capabilities from the Jupiter and Saturn       encounters and that at Uranus and Neptune was considerable.       The reduced telecommunications capability limits the number of       data modes that imaging can use.  Because of the diminished       brightness of the objects being photographed, longer exposure       times were used, many beyond the stated maximum of 15.360       seconds.  Longer exposure times were all 48-second increments       added to the maximum.  In addition, the camera was slewed in       order to avoid smeared imaging.  The light flood state (on/off)       was independent of the instrument mode.         Science Objectives     ==================       The overall objective of this experiment is exploratory       reconnaissance of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and their       satellites and rings.  Such reconnaissance, at resolutions and       phase angles unobtainable from Earth, provides much new data       relevant to the atmospheric and/or surface properties of these       bodies.  The experiment also has the following specific       objectives: observe and characterize global circulation and       meteorology; determine the horizontal and vertical structure of       visible clouds; characterize the nature of any colored material       which may be in clouds.         Operational Considerations     ==========================       To make full scientific use of the image collection, it is       necessary to understand the radiometric and geometric       characteristics of the camera system and perform corrections to       data.         Each Voyager camera is unique in terms of its calibrated       characteristics.  Each has intrinsic shading (spatially       non-uniform output DNs from flat field target) and exhibits       barrel distortions typical of TV cameras flown on previous       planetary missions.  Because of these characteristics, the       cameras were calibrated before launch.  The response of the       pixels to known targets, illumination, exposures, etc.  was       measured and Calibration Files were generated to remove       radiometric and geometric distortions from the flight images.       These Calibration Files and detailed information on their use       are available through the Imaging Node.         Calibration Description     =======================       The calibration program for the Voyager television cameras       consisted of three parts: (1) component calibrations ('Voyager       Imaging Science Subsystem Calibration Report' July 31, 1978, M.       Benesh and P.  Jepsen, D618-802); (2) subsystem calibrations;       and, (3) system calibrations.  In addition, provision was made       for in-flight calibrations.  Component calibrations were       carried out prior to camera assembly.  Important measurements       include spectral transmittance of the lens and filters, actual       exposure times and shading characteristics of the shutter, and       pertinent electro-optical properties of the vidicon.  After the       optics and sensor were assembled it was possible to run       calibrations at the camera, or subsystem, level.  Particular       activities accomplished during this period included radiometric       calibrations, focal length measurement, determination of the       modulation transfer function, measurement of the geometric       distortion, and calibrations required for color reconstruction.       System calibrations were conducted after the cameras were       installed on the spacecraft.  Important tasks included       measurement of the Field-Of-View alignment and verification of       the flat-field light transfer characteristics.  Noise       measurements were also made at the system level.         A method for in-flight calibration was also available.  It       consisted of a flat reflective surface which is located about 2       m from the camera.  A flat-field light transfer curve can be       constructed by orienting the spacecraft so that the plaque is       illuminated by the sun and by photographing it at the proper       exposure times.         However, calibration data was collected but no new calibration       files were generated during the Jupiter, Saturn, or Uranus       encounters or their related cruise periods.         Although the INSTRUMENT_PARAMETER_NAME has been provided as       Radiance, the Voyager Experiment Data Record (EDR) data set has       not been radiometrically corrected, and thus images do not       represent radiance units.  In order to convert an image from       Data Number (DN) to radiance units, the image must be       calibrated.  Radiometric calibration files, and selected       radiometrically corrected images are available through the       Imaging Node.

The         vidicon storage surface (target) is selenium sulphur and can         store a high resolution (1500 TV lines) picture for over 100         s at room temperature.  The active image area on the target         is 11.14 x 11.14 mm.  Each frame consists of 800 lines with         800 picture elements (pixels) per line, i.e., 1 pixel =14         microns.  One frame requires 48 s for electronic readout.  In         addition to the normal frame readout of 48 s (1:1), four         extended frame-time modes of 2:1, 3:1, 5:1, and 10:1 are         available by command.  Following readout, light flooding is         used to remove any residual image that might remain from the         previous frame.  At the end of light flooding, 14 erase         frames are used to stabilize and prepare the vidicon target         for the next exposure sequence (VGR ISS Calibration Report,         1978, an internal JPL document available from JPL vellum         files).           Sensitivity       -----------         Calibration experiments show the gain map indicating higher         sensitivity toward the top of the frame in a radial manner.         Dark-current ratio results indicate a mean within         plus-or-minus 3% of the true linearity of the light transfer         function.  The required accuracy of the light-transfer         functions was plus-or-minus 5% of half-scale signal averaged         over any randomly selected area of 10 contiguous pixels.         This requirement was consistently met for all Imaging Science         Subsystem (ISS) flight cameras.  The radiance of the used         light cannons was supposed to be plus-or-minus 5% or better         of the level to produce a half-scale signal.  This criterion         was also met.  It is not clear whether the color spatial         dependence is due to the vidicon, or whether the filters have         varying transmissions.  In the latter case, the ratios would         be independent of light level; and this has been observed to         be the case for all flight cameras.  Moreover, vidicons have         not shown scale variations of this magnitude in the past, so         that it is easier to believe that they are due to the         spectral filters rather than to the vidicons.  The color         sensitivity is sufficient to require a separate decalibration         file for each spectral filter, which has been done, but not         gross enough to cause concern about the quality of the image         itself (VGR ISS Calibration Report, 1978, an internal JPL         document available from JPL vellum files).         Instrument Electronics 'ISSW'     =============================         Description       -----------         The ISS electronics consist of the vidicon support circuits         and the signal chain.  The vidicon support circuits are the         vertical and horizontal sweep circuits, and the various power         supplies for the vidicon filament, and the focus and         alignment coils.  The signal chain consists of the analog         signal amplifiers, bandpass filters, and an eight bit         analog-to-digital converter.  The digital output is sent to         the Flight Data Subsystem for editing.

Electrons can be characterized, with     various electron rate energy channels, between 26 keV and     greater than 10 meV (mode dependent).  Ions, without mass     species discriminations, can be characterized with various ion     rate energy channels between 30 keV and greater than 152 keV     (mode dependent).  Rate data is telemetered as simple counts     per accumulation time period.  The different channels     correspond to different onboard energy discrimination windows     (for ions the discrimination values are mass species dependent,     leading to some ambiguity).  Above about 200 keV/nucleon, the     ions can be discriminated as to their mass species composition     by the use of multiple parameter measurements.  These     measurements consist of the energies that individual particles     deposit in more than one detector.  This information is     telemetered both as ion rate data, obtained by on-board species     identification circuitry (with various channels representing     various energy-species combinations), and as particle multiple     parameters data, consisting of pulse-height-analysis values     from each of the affected particle detectors for each analyzed     particle.  (A maximum of about 2 to 5 particles per second can     be analyzed in this fashion due to telemetry limitations.  A     priority scheme avoids saturation by one species group.  there     are three such groups defined: atomic number z = 1,2 each group     in a rotating fashion.) Angular information is obtained through     mechanical rotation of the detectors.  The main detectors look     within a single scan plane that is rotated 360 degrees,     stopping at 8 different look sectors (one of the sectors is     blocked to obtain a background measurement: sector 8).  The     lower energy detectors have full width viewcones of about 45     degrees.  The scan plane is oriented such that a line that     passes exactly between sectors 8 and 1, and also exactly     between sectors 4 and 5, is exactly parallel to the roll axis     of the spacecraft (which nominally points at earth).  When the     roll orientation of the spacecraft is such that the star sensor     is locked on Canopus, the scan plane is tilted about 30 degrees     out of the ecliptic plane, with sector 3 tilting towards north     ecliptic (and also in the direction that is retrograde with     respect to the planetary orbits).  Sectors 1 and 8 point in the     general direction of earth.  The scan rate is variable between     48 seconds to 48 minutes per 360 degree scan.  There are some     electron detectors (whose properties are not as well     established as the others) that view out of the scan plane     described here (see [KRIMIGISETAL1977]).  Some of the data is     subject to substantial contamination depending on the region     under consideration.  Before the data from this instrument can     be used, it is vital that the contamination descriptions be     examined ('CONTAMINATION_ DESC') for each contamination type     ('CONTAMINATION_ID') and that the contaminations levels be     determined ('DATA_QUALITY_ID' AND 'DATA_QUALITY_DESC').  While     sector 8 is the background sector for most (and generally the     most used) data channels, sector 4 is the background sector for     some channels.  Of those channels documented in this catalog,     sector 4 is the background sector for channels: ESA0, ESB0,     AB10, AB12, AB13, PSA1, PSA2, PSA3, PSB1, PSB2, AND PSB3.       Science Objectives   ==================     Characterize the energy spectra, angular distributions, species     composition, spatial structures, and temporal variations of the     hot plasmas, energetic particles, and particulate radiation     that exist in the vicinity of the outer planets (Jupiter,     Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) and within the interplanetary     environment.  To study the mechanisms by which such particles     are energized and transported throughout such systems.  To     study in particular the energization and transport processes     associated with hot plasmas and particulate radiation in the     vicinity of planetary bow shocks, magnetopauses, magnetotail     plasma sheets, inner radiation zones, the auroral zones, etc.,     and to study the interaction of such media with planetary     satellites and the planetary atmospheres and ionospheres.       Operational Considerations   ==========================     Instrument operates continuously sampling data over uniform     accumulation intervals.  The accumulation intervals are     different for the different channels of information (almost 100     channels).  The scan head of the LECP Instrument usually scans     back-and-forth continuously (forward by 315 degrees and then     back by 315 degrees).  The scanning head pauses at 8 different     scan sectors for periods ranging between 6 seconds and 48     seconds (for the encounter time periods) and takes about 0.5     seconds to scan between the sectors.  Specially scanning modes     for Voyager 2 at Uranus and Neptune have been developed whereby     1 or 2 quick scans are performed followed by 6 to 12 minutes of     no scanning.  Also, for Voyager 2 at Jupiter there was an     extended period of no scanning.  The roll orientation of the     spacecraft is of crucial importance as to the type of data     returned since that orientation determines the orientation of     the scan plane of the LECP Instrument.  That orientation also     has safety consequences since a poor orientation could expose     the LECP detectors to ring particulate damage.       Calibration   ===========     The instrument was calibrated on the ground by placing it into     beam chambers (e.g.  Van DeGraf machines) and firing calibrated     beams of known composition at it.  Also, a radioactive source     is positioned behind the 'sunshield' positioned at sector 8 for     in-flight calibration of some detector-electronic gains.  Also,     the instrument has a calibration mode whereby pulses of known     strength are sent into the pre-amplifier chains following the     detectors.  Information about calibration can be found in:     [KRIMIGISETAL1977], [KRIMIGISETAL1981], [ARMSTRONGETAL1981],     and [HAMILTONETAL1981].

The detector thicknesses     range from 2 to 2450 microns to cover a very broad range of     particle energy and mass characteristic.       Detectors count particles that have appropriate discriminated     characteristics with an efficiency that approaches 1.     Therefore the sensitivity is strictly a function of the     geometric factors of the detectors (geometric factors     associated with different data channels are documented     elsewhere in this catalog) and the energy and species     band-widths of the data channels (also documented elsewhere).     The geometric factors have units of area X Steradians (CM^2 X     STR).

These pieces of information can, for       example, consist of the energy deposited by a single particle       in two or more separate detectors, or the time-of-flight       between two different detectors plus the energy deposited in       a third, etc..  The multiple pieces of information can be       used to perform mass, atomic number, and/or charge state       discriminations on ions.  The information can be       discriminated on-board and telemetered in the form of ion       rate channels, or the multiple information about each       particle analyzed can be telemetered for obtaining the finest       species discriminations.

The high intensity detectors are turned on (A, B,       DELTA, DELTA PRIME).  (Affected channels are documented in       the detailed level catalog.) Particle Multiple Parameter       (PMP) composition discrimination capabilities are turned off       (including the rate channels derived from the multiple para-       meter information).  All data appears in rate (counts/second)       form.  Angular scanning is typically 6.4 minutes per 360       degrees scan but is often changed.

The mounting is such that the 360 degree scan plane     of the LECP scanning head (not to be confused with the scanning     of the imaging instruments) is coplanar with the spacecraft's     roll axis.  Also, on the Canopus star lock the LECP scan plane     is about 30 degrees rotated away from the ecliptic plane.  A     line passing between sectors 1 and 8, and between sectors 4 and     5, is parallel to the spacecraft roll axis.  Sectors 1 and 8     point in the general direction or earth, and with the Canopus     lock, sector 3 points generally in the retrograde direction     (referring to the direction with respect to the directions of     motion of the orbiting planets) and about 30 degrees north of     the ecliptic.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:vg1.mag,FLUXGATE MAGNETOMETER for VG1,FLUXGATE MAGNETOMETER,"     INSTRUMENT: FLUXGATE MAGNETOMETER   SPACECRAFT: VOYAGER 1     Instrument Information   ======================     Instrument Id                  : MAG     Instrument Host Id             : VG1     Pi Pds User Id                 : NNESS     Principal Investigator         : NORMAN F. NESS     Instrument Name                : FLUXGATE MAGNETOMETER     Instrument Type                : MAGNETOMETER     Build Date                     : 1977-09-05     Instrument Mass                : 5.600000     Instrument Length              : 13.000000     Instrument Width               : UNK     Instrument Height              : UNK     Instrument Serial Number       : UNK       Instrument Description   ======================     The magnetic field experiment carried out on the Voyager 1     mission consists of dual low field (LFM) and high field     magnetometer (HFM) systems.  The dual systems provide greater     reliability and, in the case of the LFM's, permit the     separation of the spacecraft magnetic fields from the ambient     fields.  Additional reliability is achieved through electronics     redundancy.  The wide dynamic ranges of +/- 0.002 G for the     LFM's and +/- 20 G for the HFM's, low quantization uncertainty     (+/- 12.4, 488 nanoTesla respectively), low sensor RMS noise     level (0.006 nanoTesla), and the use of data compaction schemes     to optimize the experiment information rate all combine to     permit the study of a broad spectrum of phenomena during the     mission.       Science Objectives   ==================     The investigations of the magnetic fields and magnetospheres of     the major planetary systems in the outer Solar System and their     interactions with the solar wind are primary objectives of the     space exploration program to be conducted during the Voyager 1     mission.  In addition, the investigation of the interplanetary     magnetic field phenomena during the flights is of fundamental     importance both to the understanding of the magnetospheric     observations and to a number of outstanding questions in basic     plasma physics and in the general dynamics of the solar wind.     If the Heliospheric boundary is penetrated, accurate     measurement of the interstellar magnetic field is also an     important objective.       Operational Considerations   ==========================     There are no special operational considerations for the     magnetometer described in [BEHANNONETAL1977].  All magnetometer     data are calibrated.  Three types of in-flight calibrations are     performed: 1) sensitivity calibrations, 2) zero-level     calibrations, based on rolls of the spacecraft, and 3) boom-     alignment calibrations based on the activation of on-board     coils and resulting data (especially important when dual     magnetometers are used and in strong fields for any     magnetometer).  Sensitivity calibrations (for 8 ranges) are     done approximately once every two months (early in the mission     they were done more frequently).  The magnetometer team     generally use one or two axis rolls (cruise maneuvers, CRSMR's)     of the spacecraft for zero level calibrations as often as they     are provided which is variable this is about three times per     year for the so-called mini-CRSMR's, which are two axis rolls.     Full CRSMR's and z-axis (only) roll-maneuvers have not occurred     within the last few years (full CRSMR's and mini's differ only     in the number of rolls in each).  The magnetometer team usually     succeeds in arguing for a series of rolls near each planetary     encounter.  Boom-alignment calibrations were done once after     launch and around the time of the Jupiter encounter.  Others     have been executed, but it has been determined that the inter-     sensor misalignment is small and constant.       Measured Parameters   ===================     The following LFM and HFM values are derived from Table 1 in     [BEHANNONETAL1977].       LFM Dynamic ranges and quantization uncertainty:       Range (nT)               Quantization (nT)     ----------------------------------------------     1.  +/- 8.8                    +/- .0022     2.  +/- 26                     +/- .0063     3.  +/- 79                     +/- .019     4.  +/- 240                    +/- .059     5.  +/- 710                    +/- .173     6.  +/- 2100                   +/- .513     7.  +/- 6400                   +/- 1.56     8.  +/- 50,000                 +/- 12.2       HFM Dynamic ranges and quantization uncertainty:       Range (nT)               Quantization (nT)     ----------------------------------------------     1.  +/- 5E+4                   +/- 12.3     2.  +/- 2E+6                   +/- 488       Calibration Description   =======================     The 13 meter Astromast booms have proved in extensive     pre-flight testing to be highly rigid with respect to bending     motions but soft to torsional or twisting motion.  Deployment     repeatability test have shown as much as +/- 7 degrees     uncertainty in the knowledge of the boom twist angle (about the     boom axis) at the magnetometer sensor positions, compared with     +/- 0.5 uncertainty in bend angles (rotation about axes     orthogonal to the boom axis).  In order to minimize sensor     alignment uncertainties, a method to estimate an angular     correction matrix was developed that eliminates most of the     twist uncertainty and some of the bend uncertainty.  A special     calibration coil has been wound around the periphery of the     spacecraft's high gain antenna to generate, upon command, a     known magnetic field at both LFM magnetometer sensors.  The     difference between measurements taken when the coil is turned     on and off is the coil field, independent of all external     fields.  Using a 20 turn coil of 1/2 amp yields nominal field     intensities 0f 33.4 and 6.1 nanoTesla at the inboard and     outboard sensors, respectively.  All magnetometer data are     calibrated.  Three types of in-flight calibrations are     performed: 1) sensitivity calibrations, 2) zero-level     calibrations, based on rolls of the spacecraft, and 3)     boom-alignment calibrations based on the activation of on-board     coils and resulting data (especially important when dual     magnetometers are used and in strong fields for any     magnetometer).  Sensitivity calibrations (for 8 ranges) are     done approximately once every two months (early in the mission     they were done more frequently).  The magnetometer team     generally use one or two axis rolls (cruise maneuvers, CRSMR's)     of the spacecraft for zero level calibrations as often as they     are provided which is variable this is about three times per     year for the so-called mini-CRSMR's, which are two axis rolls.     Full CRSMR's and z-axis (only) roll-maneuvers have not occurred     within the last few years (full CRSMR's and mini's differ only     in the number of rolls in each).  The magnetometer team usually     succeeds in arguing for a series of rolls near each planetary     encounter.  Boom-alignment calibrations were done once after     launch and around the time of the Jupiter encounter.  Others     have been executed, but it has been determined that the     inter-sensor misalignment is small and constant.  For more     information, consult [BEHANNONETAL1977].       LFM and HFM Detectors   =====================     Detector Type                  : RING CORE     Detector Aspect Ratio          : 0.000000     Nominal Operating Temperature  : 273.000000       Total Fovs                     : 1     Data Rate                      : UNK     Sample Bits                    : 12       The magnetometer consists of 6 ring core detectors.  These are     designated as low field magnetometers (LFM) 1-3 and high field     magnetometers (HFM) 1-3.  The basic sampling rate is .06 +/-     .006 seconds.  Sampling rate for the high field system is .6     seconds.  The detectors measure in the interval of +/- 2.0E+6     nT for HFM, and +/- 5.0E+4 for LFM.  Nominal operating     temperature for all detectors is 273 K, though the sensors were     tested over a range of +/- 60 degrees about the nominal     temperature.       Both high and low field magnetometer sensors utilize a ring     core geometry and thus have lower drive power requirements and     better zero level stability than other types of fluxgates and     are smaller in size [ACUNA1974].  The cores consist of an     advanced molybdenum alloy, especially developed in cooperation     with the Naval Surface Weapons Center, White Oak, Maryland,     which exhibits extremely low noise and high stability     characteristics.  The use of this alloy and the ring core     sensor geometry thus allows the realization of compact, low     power, ultrastable fluxgate sensors with a noise performance     that is improved almost an order of magnitude over the best     previously flown fluxgate sensors.  The HFM's use specially     processed miniature ring cores (1 cm diameter) which minimize     the power required to measure large fields.  This description     is taken directly from [BEHANNONETAL1977].         Vector Components     -----------------       The LFM1 detector and the HFM1 detector are designated as the       detectors which measure the i component of the vector       (i,j,k).  The LFM2 detector and the HFM2 detector are       designated as the detectors which measure the j component of       the vector (i,j,k).  The LFM3 detector and the HFM3 detector       are designated as the detectors which measure the k component       of the vector (i,j,k).           'HFM' Section Parameter 'MAGNETIC FIELD COMPONENT'       --------------------------------------------------       Instrument Parameter Name      : MAGNETIC FIELD COMPONENT       Sampling Parameter Name        : TIME       Instrument Parameter Unit      : NANOTESLA       Minimum Instrument Parameter   : -2000000.000000       Maximum Instrument Parameter   : 2000000.000000       Minimum Sampling Parameter     : 0.600000       Maximum Sampling Parameter     : 0.600000       Noise Level                    : 0.006000       Sampling Parameter Interval    : 0.600000       Sampling Parameter Resolution  : 0.600000       Sampling Parameter Unit        : SECOND         A measured parameter equaling the magnetic field strength       (e.g.  in nanoTeslas) along a particular axis direction.       Usually the three orthogonal axis components are measured by       three different sensors.

Usually the three orthogonal axis components are measured by       three different sensors.       Electronics   ===========     The instrument is composed of two completely redundant systems:     the 'P' or primary system and the 'S' or secondary system.       The experiment electronics instrumentation consists of the     flux-gate magnetometer electronics and associated controls, and     the calibration and data processing electronics.  Complete     redundancy is provided for the analog to digital converters,     data and status readout buffers, command decoders and power     converters.  Thus not only can the two magnetometers of a     system be interchanged, but considerable cross-strapping within     the electronics permits interchange of critical internal     functions as well.  This significantly reduces the impact of     single-component failure on the ability of the experiment to     continue successful operation during the mission duration of >     4 years.  This description is directly transposed from     [BEHANNONETAL1977] page 249.       Operational Modes   =================     Data Path Type                 : REALTIME     Instrument Power Consumption   : 2.200000       In the CRUISE mode, only the LFM subsystem is operating.  The     basic sample rate in this mode is 50/3 vectors/second.       In the ENCOUNTER mode, both LFM and HFM subsystems are     operating.  The basic sample rate in this mode is 50/3     vectors/second for the LFM system and 5/3 vectors/second for     the HFM system.       Instrument Mounting   ===================     The LFM is located near the tip of the magnetometer boom and     the HFM is located near the spacecraft body.  See     [BEHANNONETAL1977] for a picture of the actual magnetometer     mounting positions and a complete description.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:vg1.pls,PLASMA SCIENCE EXPERIMENT for VG1,PLASMA SCIENCE EXPERIMENT,"     INSTRUMENT : PLASMA SCIENCE EXPERIMENT   SPACECRAFT : VOYAGER 1     Instrument Information   ======================     Instrument Id                  : PLS     Instrument Host Id             : VG1     Principal Investigator         : JOHN D. RICHARDSON     Pi Pds User Id                 : JRICHARDSON     Instrument Name                : PLASMA SCIENCE EXPERIMENT     Instrument Type                : PLASMA INSTRUMENT     Build Date                     : 1973     Instrument Mass                : 9.900000     Instrument Length              : UNK     Instrument Width               : UNK     Instrument Height              : UNK     Instrument Serial Number       : SN002     Instrument Manufacturer Name   : MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF                                      TECHNOLOGY       Instrument Description   ======================     The Voyager Plasma Science experiment consists of four     modulated Grid Faraday Cups, three (A, B, C) of which are     positioned about the Telemetry Antenna Axis and generally point     toward the Earth with the fourth (D) at a right angle to this     direction.  Ion currents are sampled simultaneously in all four     cups, electrons in the D-cup only.  The instrument has an     energy/charge range of 10-5950 V.  Data is taken in four ways,     high and low resolution ion modes and high and low energy     electron modes with energy resolution varying between 3.6 and     29%.  The integration time for each energy channel can be     varied; 0.21 s/channel is used at Jupiter and Saturn.     Supersonic flow can be observed only when one of the detectors     points within 45 degrees of the plasma velocity, subsonic flow     is observed at all orientations.  The current observations as a     function of energy/charge allows determination of the plasma     density, temperature, and velocity.       Science Objectives   ==================     The objective of the Plasma Instrument is to characterize     plasma conditions throughout the Voyager trajectory, in the     solar wind, during the planetary encounters, and in the     interstellar medium.       Operational Considerations   ==========================     Each detector has an effective field of view which is a cone of     half angle 45 degrees; the detector response falls off quickly     at higher angles.  Thus, for the instrument to measure ion     parameters in a supersonic or transonic plasma some of the     detectors must look into the plasma flow.  Secondary ions and     electrons produced within the detectors can also effect the     measurements, especially if large fluxes of hot ions or     electrons are present.  These effects are not well modeled are     rarely significant.  The instrument does not measure     composition, only energy/charge, so a model of plasma     composition must be adopted to fit the ion data.  The choice of     models can be unambiguous for large Mach number flow (M>3) but     is non-unique for lower Mach numbers.  After the Jupiter     encounter the highest energy/charge channels of the A, B, and C     detectors often contain spurious signal and currents in the     upper half of the energy range should be examined carefully     before use.       Calibration Description   =======================     The instrument was calibrated at MIT using ion and electron     beams and compared to output from other Faraday cups in the     same beam.  Current levels are also calibrated in-flight by     injecting known currents into the detectors with the modulators     on and off.  Much theoretical modeling has been done on the     response of the detectors to arbitrary plasma conditions.     Contact the PI for more information.       Detectors 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'D'   ================================     Detector Type                  : FARADAY CUP     Detector Aspect Ratio          : 0.000000     Nominal Operating Temperature  : 278.000000       The PLS instrument consists of four Faraday cups.  Three of     these (A, B, C) are arranged in a cone whose central axis is     parallel to the direction of the telemetry antenna.  The look     direction of each of these cups is offset 20 degrees from the     central axis.  Detector D has a look direction approximately     perpendicular to the direction of the telemetry antenna.  Each     detector consists of three modulator grids, six shield grids     and a suppressor grid in front of the collector.  It measures     ion currents in the range 10-5950 V.       Depending on the integration time, the detectors measure     current from a minimum of 3.e-14 to 2.e-13 AMPS up to a maximum     of 6.e-8 AMPS.  The integration time for each energy channel     can be varied from .03 to .93 seconds.  The time between     successive spectra varies from 12 to 192 s.

A single     8-bit logarithmic A-D converter samples the four outputs of the     measurement chains and transfers the data to the spacecraft.     The high voltage modulator supplies a DC pedestal and a super-     imposed 400 HZ square wave modulation voltage.  For positive     ions the modulator grids of all four detectors are driven in     parallel.  A more complete description and block diagram of the     instrument electronics is available in [BRIDGEETAL1977].       Operating Modes   ===============     The four operating modes of Voyager PLS are listed below.     Instrument power consumption is 8.1 W for all modes.       E1: Low energy electron mode which measures the range 10-140 V         with 16 contiguous channels.       E2: High energy electron mode which measures the range 10-5950         V with 16 contiguous channels.       L:  Low-resolution ion mode which measures the range 10-5950 V         with 16 contiguous channels.       M:  High resolution ion mode which measures the range 10-5950         V with 128 contiguous channels.       Instrument Mounting   ===================     The PLS instrument is located on the Science Boom.  The center     of the main detector cluster (A, B, C) points parallel to the     spacecraft telemetry antenna and detector D is at right angles     to this direction.

WARWICK     Build Date                        : UNK     Instrument Mass                   : 7.700000     Instrument Height                 : UNK     Instrument Length                 : UNK     Instrument Width                  : UNK     Instrument Manufacturer Name      : MARTIN MARIETTA     Instrument Serial Number          : UNK       Science Objectives   ==================     The Planetary Radio Astronomy (PRA) experiments' primary     objective was to locate and explain kilometric, hectometric,     and decametric radio emissions from the planets; to measure     plasma resonances near the giant planets; and to detect     lightning on the giant planets.  The instrument was also     successful at observing solar radio emissions from the     perspective of the outer solar system.       Radio emissions can be used to determine the rate of rotation     of the inner core of a planet, to determine the existence of a     magnetic field, and to search for magnetic anomalies.  Radio     emissions are often the only remote diagnostic for interactions     occurring in the portions of magnetospheres through which a     spacecraft does not pass.  This is particularly true for the     inner magnetosphere, which usually goes unsampled.       Further information on the instrument and the investigations     performed can be found in [WARWICKETAL1997].       Instrument Description   ======================     The Voyager Planetary Radio Astronomy (PRA) instrument     consisted of two superheterodyne receivers, one for the range     from 1326.0 to 1.2 kHz (center frequency) and a second for the     range 40.55 to 1.53 MHz (center frequency).  The channels are     numbered so that the lowest frequency channel (1.2 kHz) is     channel number 198.  Channels in the range 1 to 128 are     referred to as 'high band', and the remaining channels as 'low     band'.  In low band, the channel spacing is 19.2 kHz.  In high     band, the channel spacing is 307.2 kHz.       The PRA receiver is driven by two orthogonal antennas mounted     on the spacecraft body.  Each antenna element is made of BeCu     hollow tubes 0.5 inches in diameter and is 10 meters in length.     By combining the signals from the two antennas in a 90 degree     hybrid, the PRA instrument can distinguish between the opposing     states, left hand and right hand, of circular polarization of     an incoming wave.       The Planetary Radio Astronomy (PRA) receivers were calibrated     under environmentally-controlled conditions and over the entire     frequency and dynamic range of the instruments.  This     calibration consisted in application of a known narrow-band     signal across the inputs and recording the receiver outputs.       The laboratory calibrations provided power levels for each data     number (DN) and each frequency in terms of known inputs across     the antenna terminals of each of the experiment's two     monopoles.  Calibrations were carried out over a range of     receiver temperatures, but in practice the stability of the     receiver as a function of temperature and the stability of the     temperature of the receiver as a function of mission phase and     the status of the overall spacecraft were such that a single     calibration for each DN at each frequency could be used.       Receiver output levels were quantized.  The minimum value for     the wave flux density was frequency dependent varying from     5.E-20 W M**-2 Hz**-1 at frequencies below 1.5 MHz to 5.E-19 at     frequencies above 1.5 MHz.  The maximum wave flux density was     typically 50 dB above the minimum value.  The instrument noise     level also was frequency dependent.  It was about 1.E-19 W     M**-2 Hz**-1 below 1.5 MHz.  The noise at 10 MHz was still     about 1E-19 W M**-2 Hz**-1, increased to about 1.E-17 W M**-2     Hz**-1 at 25 MHz, and then decreased to an intermediate value     at 40 MHz.       The low-band and high-band operation of the receiver differ.     In low-band the receiver operated with a sharply tuned filter     only 1 kHz broad at the 3 dB points and in high-band, with a     200 kHz filter.  The gain of the receivers was designed in such     a way that the output increased discontinuously by 23 dB     (corresponding to the 200:1 bandwidth ratio) between the lowest     frequency of high-band and the highest frequency of low-band.     This caused the instrument output to remain constant across the     high-band to low-band transition point if its input was     broadband noise.       If unpolarized radiation fell orthogonally on each monopole,     the total unpolarized flux density for signals below about 5     MHz could be roughly estimated to be       S = So (10**(m/1000)),       where m was the channel reading in millibels and So is       So = 1.5E-21 (W/Hz m**2).       No reliable method for estimating the flux density exists for     frequencies above 5 MHz due to the increasing effect of antenna     resonances.       Although the PRA instrument had 14 possible operating modes, in     practice the mode called POLLO was used more than 95% of the     time.  In POLLO, the receiver swept through all 198 channels in     sequence from the highest frequency to the lowest.  At each     frequency step, data were produced every 30 msec, consisting of     25 msec of integration and 5 msec of switching and settling     time.  Thus, a full sweep through all 200 channels took 6 sec     (including 60 msec for two status words).  Between steps the 90     degree hybrid was switched such that the receiver was sensitive     to the alternate sense of circular polarization.  This toggling     between left hand and right hand polarization itself alternated     with each 6 sec receiver sweep.  Thus, for a given frequency, a     pair of left hand and right hand measurements were 6 sec     apart.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:vg1.pws,PLASMA WAVE RECEIVER for VG1,PLASMA WAVE RECEIVER,"     INSTRUMENT: PLASMA WAVE RECEIVER   SPACECRAFT: VOYAGER 1     Instrument Overview   ===================     Instrument Id                  : PWS     Instrument Host Id             : VG1     Principal Investigator         : DONALD A. GURNETT     PI PDS User Id                 : DGURNETT     Instrument Name                : PLASMA WAVE RECEIVER     Instrument Type                : PLASMA WAVE SPECTROMETER     Build Date                     : UNK     Instrument Mass                : 1.400000     Instrument Length              : 0.318000     Instrument Width               : 0.185000     Instrument Height              : 0.048000     Instrument Serial Number       : SN002     Instrument Manufacturer Name   : THE UNIVERSITY OF IOWA       The Plasma Wave Receiver on Voyager consists of both a     16-channel spectrum analyzer covering the range of 10 Hertz to     56.2 kiloHertz and a wideband waveform receiver which returns     the waveform of waves in the frequency range of 40 Hertz to 12     kiloHertz.  The spectrum analyzer provides data on a continual     basis with a maximum temporal resolution of one spectrum per 4     seconds.  The waveform receiver returns 4-bit samples of the     electric field measured at a rate of 28,800 samples per second.     Because of the very high data rate, the waveform samples must     be transmitted in the same manner as the Voyager imaging     information.  At Jupiter, some 10,000 48-second waveform frames     were obtained.  At Saturn, the number of frames obtained was     very small due to the lower telemetry rates available at the     greater distance of that planet.       Science Objectives   ==================     The primary science objective of the Voyager plasma wave     investigation is to make the first surveys of the plasma wave     and low frequency radio wave spectra in the magnetospheres of     the outer planets: Jupiter and Saturn.  Plasma waves     participate in a fundamental manner in the dynamics of     planetary magnetospheres and in the interactions of that     magnetosphere with the external solar wind and internal     perturbations such as those induced by satellites interior to     the magnetosphere.  Plasma waves also provide diagnostic     information about the plasma environment near the planets     including such parameters as electron density and sometimes     temperature.  The instrument is also sensitive to low frequency     radio emissions and, therefore, acts as a low frequency     extension to the Planetary Radio Astronomy investigation.     Radio waves are often the only means of remotely observing     regions of plasma not accessible to the spacecraft and also     lead to remote diagnostics of plasma conditions.  The plasma     wave receivers are also sensitive to the results of small dust     particles impacting on various parts of the spacecraft at high     velocities and, hence, provide a direct measure of the rate of     impact, the density of the dust, and an estimate of the mass     distribution of dust in the vicinity of the large planets,     especially those with rings and otherwise dusty environments.     Finally, the Plasma Wave Receiver will characterize the plasma     wave and radio wave spectrum of the outer heliosphere and     perhaps beyond, extending our understanding of solar wind     plasma processes and wave-particle interactions to several tens     of Astronomical Units.       Operational Considerations   ==========================     The primary operational considerations of the PWS include     maintaining the proper operating mode and obtaining waveform     samples as often as the spacecraft tape recorder/downlink     capabilities allow.  The standard instrument mode is with     Waveform Power On and Input Gain State Hi.  For encounter     periods, this corresponds to GS3GAINHI/WFMPWRON.  Since there     has never been a period when the signal levels were so high as     to require the Low input gain state, and it is highly unlikely     that such levels will ever be encountered, Low Input Gain State     should never be selected.  As long as there is power margin     available, it is most straightforward to leave the Waveform     Receiver Power on.  The power consumption is less than 0.5 Watt     for this section, hence, the power savings afforded by turning     it off is not large.  The most involved operational     consideration is providing for the transmission of waveform     data to the ground.  At Jupiter, the majority of the waveform     data could be sent directly to the ground via the 115200 bps     downlink.  This capability disappeared after Jupiter, however,     because of the greater distance to the spacecraft, hence, lower     telecon rates.  Since operating the A/D converter at a rate     less than 28800 Hertz would result in aliasing, it is necessary     to record the data at the 115200 bps rate on the spacecraft     tape recorder using the appropriate data mode and playback the     recorded data at a lower rate, commensurate with the link     capabilities.  Again, a choice of the proper playback mode is     required.  Since the data modes available on the spacecraft are     highly dependent on mission phase, these modes are not     described here.       Calibration Description   =======================     The Voyager plasma wave receiver spectrum analyzers were     calibrated by first establishing a relationship between input     voltage (of a sine wave at the filter center frequency) and     output voltage and second by measuring the effective bandwidth     of the filter.  The bandwidth is measured by applying a random     noise signal of known spectral density and by measuring the     output voltage which, by the first part of the calibration, is     related to the rms voltage of a sine wave.  Dividing the     equivalent sine wave voltage squared by the input spectral     density gives a bandwidth.  This procedure is repeated for each     of the frequency channels.       'PWS ANTENNA' Detector   ======================     Detector Type                  : DIPOLE ANTENNA     Nominal Operating Temperature  : 298.000000       The PWS uses a pair of 10 meter antenna elements as a balanced     dipole antenna.  The two elements are extended from the     spacecraft at right angles to each other.  (The elements are     shared with the Planetary Radio Astronomy instrument, which     uses them as a pair of monopoles so that measurements of the     degree of right and left hand circular polarization can be     made.) The PWS measures the voltage difference between the two     elements which, when coupled with the effective length of the     antenna system (7.07 m) yields an electric field strength in     units of volt/meter.  The antenna system has the usual dipole     antenna pattern which yields nearly 4*pi steradians in its     field of view, although there is a range of fields of view     where the detector response drops dramatically as one expects     from a dipole pattern.       The PWS antenna, used as a balanced dipole with an effective     length of 7.07 meters gives a sensitivity to fluctuating (wave)     electric fields down to the range of 5.E-6 volt/meter.  Even     though the antenna elements are extended orthogonally to each     other, the antenna pattern is still a dipole since the elements     are short with respect to the wavelengths of the waves.  The     presence of the various parts of the spacecraft in close     proximity to the antenna can result in a distorted pattern, but     this has not been studied in the frequency range of the PWS.       Electronics   ===========     The PWS electronics system consists of three basic sections.     The first is the power supply system which regulates and     filters the 28 volt, 2400 Hertz spacecraft power supply and     provides DC voltages to the remainder of the instrument     electronics.  The second section is the spectrum analyzer which     consists of two banks of 8 narrowband filters, and two     logarithmic detectors, each of which provides an analog voltage     proportional to the log of the signal strength delivered to the     detector from any of the eight filters it services.  The analog     outputs from these two compressors, as they are called, are     sent to the Flight Data System of the spacecraft for conversion     to an 8-bit digital value.  The spacecraft steps the inputs to     the two compressors periodically (once per 0.5 seconds in GS3     or encounter mode) so that signal strengths in each of the 16     channels is measured over a 4-second interval.  The third     section consists of a single broadband filter of 40 Hertz to 12     kiloHertz, an automatic gain controlled amplifier, and a 4-bit     A/D converter.  This section digitizes the electric field     waveform at a 28800 Hertz rate.  The output amplitude is     controlled by the automatic gain control in order to keep the     signals within the useful range provided by the 4-bit     digitization.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:vg1.rss,Radio Science Subsystem for Voyager 1,Radio Science Subsystem,"       Instrument Overview     ===================       Voyager Radio Science investigations at the giant planets       utilized instrumentation with elements both on the spacecraft       and at the DSN.  Much of this was shared equipment, being used       for routine telecommunications as well as for Radio Science.       The performance and calibration of both the spacecraft and       tracking stations directly affected the radio science data       accuracy, and they played a major role in determining the       quality of the results.  The spacecraft part of the radio       science instrument is described immediately below; in most       cases, the description applies equally well to both Voyager 1       and Voyager 2 and it applies throughout the Voyager mission.         The description of the DSN (ground) part of the instrument may       be found in DSN context products.         Instrument Specifications     =========================       The Voyager spacecraft telecommunications subsystem served as       part of a radio science subsystem for investigations of the       giant planets.  Many details of the subsystem are unknown; its       'build date' is taken to be 1977-09-05, the launch date for       Voyager 1.           Instrument Id                 : RSS-VG1S       Instrument Host Id            : VG1       Pi Pds User Id                : UNK       Instrument Name               : RADIO SCIENCE SUBSYSTEM       Instrument Type               : RADIO SCIENCE       Build Date                    : 1977-09-05       Instrument Mass               : UNK       Instrument Length             : UNK       Instrument Width              : UNK       Instrument Height             : UNK       Instrument Manufacturer Name  : UNK       Instrument Overview     ===================       The spacecraft radio system was constructed around a redundant       pair of transponders.  Each transponder was equipped with an       S-band receiver (2115 MHz nominal frequency) and transmitters       at both S-band (2295 MHz nominal) and X-band (8415 MHz nominal).       Compared with S-band, X-band was less sensitive to plasma effects       by a factor of about 10; use of both frequencies coherently on       the 'downlink' allowed estimation of plasma content along the       radio path.  Use of X-band also significantly improved the       quality of radio tracking data for gravity investigations.         The transponder generated downlink signals in either 'coherent'       or 'non-coherent' modes, also known as 'two-way' and 'one-way',       respectively.  When operating in the coherent mode, the       transmitted carrier frequency was derived coherently from the       received uplink carrier frequency with a 'turn-around ratio' of       240/221 at S-band and (11/3)*240/221 at X-band.         In non-coherent mode the transmitted frequency was controlled       by an on-board oscillator; the X- and S-band remained coherent       in the ratio 11/3.  A single Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO) was       used during radio occultations; it provided stabilities       several orders of magnitude better than the conventional       crystal oscillators, which were part of each transponder.         Stability of the Voyager USO was specified in terms of its       Allan Deviation -- the fractional frequency deviation from       linear drift.  Over 10 minute periods, the Allan       Deviation ranged from 10**-12 to 4 10**-12 for integrations of       1-10 sec.  Long-term fractional drift of the oscillator was       about 5 10**-11 per day.  Although the oscillator was hardened,       there were discontinuities in the drift when the spacecraft       passed through the radiation belts of the outer planets.       Equivalent X-band microwave frequencies for the Voyager 1 USO       during key events were:                      8,414,995,272.530 Hz (Titan occultation)                      8,414,995,272.376 Hz (Saturn occultation)       Multiplying by 3/11 yields the S-band frequency.         Traveling wave tube or solid state amplifiers boosted the       transponder output.  Output powers of 9 and 26  watts could       be selected at S-band; the choices at X-band were 12 and 22       watts.         The signals were radiated via a 3.66 m diameter parabolic high       gain antenna (HGA).  The transmit boresight gain of the HGA was       36 dB at S-band and 47 dB at X-band.  The half-power       half-width of the antenna beam was 0.32 degrees at X-band and       1.1 degrees at S-band.  Transmit polarization was right-hand       circular at S-band and either right- or left-hand circular at       X-band.  A Low-Gain Antenna (LGA) was mounted on the feed       structure of the HGA and radiated approximately uniformly over       the hemisphere into which the HGA pointed.  It was used during       maneuvers, spacecraft anomalies, and at other times when the       HGA was not appropriate.         For receiving, the S-band HGA gain was 35 dB at 2115 MHz and the       polarization was right-hand circular.  The receiving system       noise temperature was approximately 2000 K, the carrier tracking       loop bandwidth was 18 Hz, and the ranging channel noise       bandwidth was 1.5 MHz.       Operational Considerations     ==========================       Descriptions given here are for nominal performance.  The       spacecraft transponder system comprised redundant units,       each with slightly different characteristics.  As the       transponder units ages, their performance changed slightly.       More importantly, the performance for radio science depended       on operational factors such as the modulation state for the       transmitters, which cannot be predicted in advance.  The       performance also depended on factors which were not always       under the control of the Voyager Project.         Spacecraft receivers were designed to lock to the uplink       signal.  Without locking, Doppler effects -- resulting from       relative motion of the spacecraft and ground station -- could       result in loss of the radio link as the frequency of the       received signal drifted.  A series of failures in the Voyager 2       receivers left that transponder unable to track the uplink        signal.  Beginning in April 1978, Doppler shifts were predicted        and the uplink carrier was tuned so that Voyager 2 would see what       appeared to be a signal at constant frequency (to an accuracy of        100 Hz.  There were no such problems with Voyager 1.         During deep occultations by the giant planets, the bending angle       resulting from refraction exceeded 10 degrees in some cases --       well beyond the half power beamwidth of the spacecraft antenna.       In those cases, the pointing of the HGA was adjusted so that       it followed a 'virtual' Earth and maximum signal strength could       be sustained.  These 'limb-track' maneuvers were critically       dependent on accurate timing during the encounter.  To protect       against Voyager 1 timing errors at Titan (primarily from       uncertainties in the radius and position of the satellite),       no limb-track was attempted during ingress, and a fixed       antenna offset was used during egress.  Fortunately, timing was       accurate enough that useful data were obtained from each event.         Although the spacecraft radioisotope thermoelectric generators       were not dependent on solar flux for power, their output decayed       as the Voyager spacecraft moved outward through the solar       system.  During encounters with the outer planets, caution was       required in budgeting power and the high-power mode could not       be used for the radio transmitters.       Calibration Description     =======================       Prior to and during some encounter sequences, the spacecraft       was commanded to execute a 'mini-ASCAL' maneuver.  The HGA was       moved slightly above the Earth line then slightly below the       Earth line.  The procedure was repeated to the left and right       of the Earth line so that a 'cross-hair' pattern was mapped       out.  During the maneuver, the amplitude of the carrier       signal was measured carefully.  Analysis of the results       showed whether the HGA was pointed accurately and, if not,       allowed estimation of the error magnitude and direction.         Prior to and after encounters, the spacecraft frequency       reference was switched to the USO for several hours and the       carrier signal was monitored using equipment at the DSN.       These 'USO Tests' were used to calibrate the frequency and       frequency drift of the USO.  USO tests were particularly       important before and after the spacecraft entered a severe       radiation environment since the radiation typically damaged       the crystal and changed its characteristics slightly.       Platform Mounting Descriptions     ==============================       The centerline of the bus was the roll axis of the       spacecraft; it also served as the z-axis of the spacecraft       coordinate system with the high-gain antenna (HGA) boresight       defining the negative z-direction.  The HGA boresight was       also defined as cone angle 0 degrees and as azimuth 180       degrees, elevation 7 degrees.  The Low-Gain Antenna (LGA)       was mounted on the feed structure of the HGA and radiated       approximately uniformly over the hemisphere into which the       HGA pointed.       Instrument Section / Operating Mode Descriptions     ================================================       The Voyager radio system consisted of two sections, which       could be operated in the following modes:         Section      Mode       -------------------------------------------       Oscillator   two-way (coherent)                    one-way (non-coherent)       RF output    low-gain antenna                    high-gain antenna         Selected parameters describing NASA Standard Transponder (NST)       performance are listed below:         Oscillator Parameters:                    S-Band     X-Band          Two-Way Transponder Turnaround Ratio  240/221    880/221          One-Way Transmit Frequency (MHz)        2296.      8415.

This discussion applies to both, except       in a few instances in which important differences between the       two are noted explicitly.  The Voyager 1 Ultraviolet       Spectrometer (UVS) is a compact Wadsworth mounted objective       grating spectrometer that covers the wavelength range of 0.0535       to 0.1702 micron (0.0513 to 0.1680 micron for the Voyager 2       UVS).  It records the entire spectrum within this range in a       single exposure.  It has no moving parts.  A mechanical       'collimator' consisting of a series of 13 aperture plates       defines the main 'airglow' field of view (FOV) of 0.10 degrees       degrees full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) x 0.87 degrees in length.       Light passing through the collimator strikes the concave       diffraction grating at near normal incidence.  The grating       disperses and focuses light onto a 1-d array detector that       records individual photoevents.  An auxiliary field of view for       solar occultation experiments is offset 20 degrees from the       airglow field by a small mirror near the front of the       collimator. Using this 'occultation port', the UVS can view the       Sun without pointing the main field, and those of other       coaligned instruments, directly at the Sun.  The occultation       field is 0.25 FWHM x 0.87 degrees.  A sunshade prevents       illumination of the main entrance aperture by the sun during       occultation observations.         The UVS has two spectral resolutions depending on the nature of       the source.  An extended monochromatic source that fills the       FOV ideally produces a triangular intensity distribution of 0.1       degree FWHM.  (The actual response function is slightly rounded       at the top and base, but a triangle is a satisfactory       approximation for most applications.) The 0.1 degree       corresponds to width of 3.5 anodes, or 0.0033 microns.  This       inherent spectral resolution may often be improved by spectral       analysis.  A monochromatic point source is imaged onto a width       of about 1 anode for a practical resolution of about 0.0015       microns.  Precise measurements of the relative response as a       function of position within the FOV have been made by rastering       the FOV across a star.  At wavelengths longward of 0.1350       microns there is a slight (~10%) asymmetry in the response on       either side of the center of the FOV.         The effective sizes of the entrance apertures are (airglow       port) 21.2 and (occultation port) 0.75 cm**2.         The anode array is scanned at a rate of 3125 scans per second       and the results are added into an internal memory.  The UVS       transmits the contents of this memory to the flight data system       (FDS) on command of the FDS.  The FDS retrieves values for a       pair of channels each 5 msec, and so reads a complete spectrum       from the UVS in 0.32 sec.  For the fastest transmitted data       rate (OC-1, see below) used for occultation observations, this       readout proceeds continuously, producing a series of spectra       separated by 0.32 sec.  For lower data rates, the memory is       read in bursts of 0.32 sec separated by the appropriate       intervals.  During these intervals, the UVS integrates the       spectrum in its internal memory.  As the data is transferred to       the FDS it is logarithmically compressed from 16 to 10 bits.         The FDS determines the rate at which spectra are read from the       UVS after being integrated internally in the instrument memory.       Most planetary observations are made at one of two data rates,       OC-1 (0.32 sec spectra, for occultation measurements) and GS-3       (3.84 sec spectra, for emission spectroscopy).  Slower rates       are used from time to time.  Rates and their designations are:             Name            Mode #           Integration time (sec)             OC-1            1                0.32             GS-3            2                3.84             CR-1            3                12             CR-2            4                48             CR-4            6                192             CR-6            8                720             CR-5T           9                240             UV-5A           10               3.84         A description of the UVS investigation is given by       [BROADFOOTETAL1977].  Performance and analysis techniques are       described by [BROADFOOTETAL1981].         Scientific Objectives     =====================       The primary goal of the UVS is to study the composition and       structure of the atmospheres of the outer planets and their       satellites.  Secondary goals include the study of       magnetospheric particle populations, magnetosphere-atmosphere       interactions, the composition and distribution of the       interplanetary wind, determinations of the solar flux, and       stellar astronomy.         Operational Considerations     ==========================       The Voyager UVS instruments have operated nearly continuously       since launch in 1977.  With the singular exception of a       decrease in the Voyager 1 microchannel plates (MCP) gain, due       to a high radiation-induced count rate during passage through       the inner Jovian magnetosphere, both instruments have remained       photometrically stable at a better than 3% level since 1977.       In-flight performance of the UVS from launch through the 1979       Jupiter encounters is reviewed in [BROADFOOTETAL1981] and an up       to date description of astronomical observations is contained       in [HOLBERG1990] and [LINICK&HOLBERG1991].         Calibration Description     =======================       Laboratory calibration of the UVS included measurements of:             1) sensitivity at a number of wavelengths throughout the              spectral range,           2) response to scattered light,           3) off-axis response, including collimator transmission              function, and           4) intrinsic dark count rate.         In-flight calibration has included assessments of absolute       sensitivity by comparisons with stars, and measurements of the       FOV response profile using stars.         Before the absolute calibration can be applied to a measured       spectrum, three or four spectral analysis steps are required.       These are flat field correction, dark count subtraction, and       descattering, and (sometimes) sky background removal.         Channel-to-channel variations in sensitivity result from       variations in effective count threshold among channels.       Applying a 'fixed pattern noise' (FPN) correction adjusts the       signal levels to their equivalents for a common threshold in       all channels.  The FPN correction involves a channel-by-channel       multiplication by a correction spectrum.  The correction       spectra are different for Voyager 1 and Voyager 2.  In fact,       two spectra are in use for Voyager 1.  The first is used for       data acquired before Jupiter encounter and the second for data       after encounter.  The two differ to account for changes in the       response of the Voyager 1 UVS induced by its operation in the       intense Jovian radiation environment.         Channels 3 and 4 have large FPN corrections, i.e.  they are       less sensitive than the others.  Therefore the statistical       accuracy of the signal in these channels is lower than in the       other channels.           Dark Counts       -----------         In interplanetary space, detector dark counts arise mainly         from effects of gamma radiation from the radioisotope         thermoelectric generators that power the spacecraft.  The         count rate is about 0.02 counts per channel per second.  The         shape is approximately flat in wavelength, with a step near         the edge of the filter in the detector.  The shape is         accurately known from long observations of the calibration         plate mounted on the spacecraft.  Almost no photon signal         (except for a weak reflection of sky-background H Lyman         alpha) is recorded during these observations.  The absolute         level varies slightly with scan platform position, because         rotating the scan platform changes the shielding mass between         the UVS detector and the generators.  For data acquired         outside a planetary magnetosphere, subtracting a scaled dark         spectrum from a calibration plate observation is usually a         satisfactory correction for dark counting.           Within a planetary magnetosphere, the dark count rate can         include contributions from high-energy particles.  For lower         levels, scaling a calibration plate spectrum is again         satisfactory, but for higher levels the shape of the dark         spectrum changes and another method must be used to         estimate dark levels.  The best alternative is to use a         spectrum taken at nearly the same time with no significant         source in the FOV.  Satellite observations often fill this         need.           Descattering       ------------         Light scattered within the instrument illuminates channels         outside the ideal transmission function of the collimator.         The effects of scattering are removed by a process called         descattering.  Descattering is accomplished through the use         of a matrix operator, a 126x126 element matrix which         describes the response of detector channel 'j' to the         measured signal at channel 'i'.  This scattering matrix is         completely empirical, having been determined from laboratory         measurements of 50 individual emission lines covering the         entire passband.  Descattering is a linear operation.  Dark         counts must be subtracted prior to descattering as the         descattering algorithm is based on the assumption that only         photon events are present.  Descattering will also correct         for second order response.  Therefore, if the spectrum to be         descattered contains artifacts, such as anomalously high or         low counts in channels 3 or 4, a corresponding error will be         introduced in the vicinity of both the first and second order         positions.           Sky Background Subtraction       --------------------------         When the UVS slit is not completely filled by the disk of a         planet, the portion off the planet sees the sky background.         Fortunately, in the far UV the sky is generally quite dark         and diffuse starlight is seldom significant.  However, bright         emissions at H Lyman alpha, Lyman beta, and He 0.0584 microns         from the interplanetary medium (IPM) often must be taken into         account.  These lines arise from strong solar chromospheric         emission lines that are scattered from neutral H and He of         the local interstellar medium.  The physics of this         'interstellar wind' is complex and leads to emission which is         inhomogeneous in space and variable in time.  The IPM         responds to active regions of the solar chromosphere as the         sun rotates.  This means that the sky brightness as seen by         the UVS can change noticeably on time scale of days.  As with         instrumental dark counts, there are two standard means of         removing sky background: direct subtraction of an adjacent         sky background suitably scaled, if available, and         construction of a synthetic sky background spectrum.           Calibration       -----------         Calibrating the spectra converts them from count units to         absolute brightness units. This step has not been included in         the data processing because the correct procedure depends on         the type of source viewed. The data spectra represent count         rates after correction for fixed pattern noise, a background         subtraction, and descattering. Multiplying these spectra by         one of the calibration spectra converts it to brightness         units. There is a calibration spectrum corresponding to each         of the two source types, namely point sources and extended         sources.           Point Source: Multiplying a data spectrum by the calibration         spectrum VxPTCAL.TAB (x=1 for Voyager 1 and x=2 for Voyager 2)         converts the spectrum from counts/(channel) to         photons/(cm**2-Angstrom-time), where time is the integration         time of the spectrum.           Extended Source, continuum emission: Multiplying a data         spectrum that has been normalized to an integration time of 1         second by the calibration spectrum VxFLCAL.TAB (x=1 for         Voyager 1 and 2 for Voyager 2) converts the spectrum from         counts/(channel-second) to spectral brightness in units of         Rayleighs/Angstrom for a source that fills the field of view.           Extended Source, monochromatic emission: The finite spectral         resolution (about 35 A) of the spectrograph must be considered         in this case. For isolated lines (those that are not strongly         blended with emissions at nearby wavelengths) it is sufficient         to sum the channels that include light from the emission of         interest (about 7 channels) and multiply by the appropriate         calibration factor. This factor is the product of the         dispersion (9.26 Angstroms/channel) and the value in         VxFLCAL.TAB corresponding to the center channel of the         wavelength of interest. The resulting quantity is the         brightness of a monochromatic emission that fills the field of         view. For more complex spectra that include blended emissions,         the most accurate approach is spectral analysis by generating         synthetic spectra. This technique uses an iterative approach         to adjust an estimated brightness spectrum until the model         spectrum computed from it matches the observed spectrum. The         model can be fairly simple, but must include the triangular         transmission profile of the collimator and the instrument         sensitivity (calibration). The calibration factor described         earlier in this paragraph is the correct one to use for this         kind of synthesis.             Calibration and spectral analysis issues are discussed by         [HOLBERGETAL1982] and [HOLBERG1986].         Platform Mounting Descriptions     ==============================       The UVS is mounted on the scan platform.  The instrument is       approximately bore-sighted with the wide and narrow angle       television cameras, and with the PPS and IRIS instruments.  The       alignment of the fields is not perfect; the following table       gives offsets of the centers of the UVS fields relative to the       centers of the ISS Narrow Angle Camera fields of view.

Photoelectrons ejected at the front of the MCP stack are       amplified by a factor of about 1E6, and the resulting charge       pulse is collected by the anode array.  The 128 narrow aluminum       anodes, each 3 mm long, are deposited on 0.1-mm centers for a       collecting length (in the dispersion direction) of 13 mm.         The anodes are accessed sequentially by a shift register and       FET switches contained on the single integrated circuit.  The       scanning circuitry discharges each anode into a charge       sensitive preamplifier.  The charge pulse is digitized and the       information added into a shift register memory consisting of       128 16-bit words.  The 128-anode array consists of two separate       interdigitated 64-anode arrays scanned by two shift registers.       The shift registers and memory are driven by a 200 kHz clock,       so that an individual anode is accessed every 320 microsecond.       The detector scan rate is therefore about 3125 Hz.         Wavelengths shorter than about 0.1250 micron strike the MCP       directly.  Longer wavelengths first pass through a MgF2 filter       with a semi-transparent photocathode of CuI.  This serves to       boost the quantum efficiency at long wavelengths and to reduce       the response to second-order light.         The detector is heavily shielded to reduce its response to       trapped particle radiation.  A description of the detector may       be found in [BROADFOOT&SANDEL1977].

Most of the electronics is in       the base of the instrument, but clock drive generators for the       anode array and the first stage of charge sensitive       preamplification of the analog signal processing electronics       are mounted in the detector housing so that they are near the       anode array.  Elements of the electronics complement include:              (1)  Low voltage power supply            (2)  High voltage power supply            (3)  Clock drive generator for the anode array            (4)  Analog signal processing electronics including A/D                 conversion            (5)  128x16 bit accumulation memory for spectrum            (6)  FDS interface         The FDS interface sends data to the FDS on demand and accepts       mode commands from the FDS.  The mode commands set the level of       the high voltage applied to the MCPs of the detector and set       the mode of analog signal processing (pulse counting or       integration).         Radiation-hard electronics components were used where possible,       and spot radiation shielding was used to reduce the fluence at       certain critical elements.         Instrument Optics 'UVS'     =======================       The optical system consists mainly of the mechanical collimator       and concave diffraction grating.  The 13 aperture plates of the       collimator establish a field of 0.1x0.87 degree for the airglow       field and 0.25x0.87 degree for the occultation field.  The 0.1       and 0.25 degree dimensions are in the dispersion direction, and       the 0.87 degree dimension is in the cross-dispersion direction.       The collimator provides separate light paths for the airglow       and occultation ports, and a small mirror diverts the       occultation field by 20 degrees from the airglow field.         The concave diffraction grating is a platinum coated replica,       ruled at 540 lines/mm, blazed at 0.0800 microns and having a       spherical radius of curvature of 400.1 mm.  Dispersion in the       image plane is 0.00926 microns/mm, or 0.000926 microns/channel.       The grating substrate is a 4x6-cm rectangle, and the useful       ruled area is 21 square cm.

In the pulse       counting mode, the number in the corresponding memory location       is incremented by one if a charge above a fixed threshold is       detected on an anode.  The access time of 320 microsec implies       that single random photoevents can be recorded on any one of       the anodes at a rate of about 300 Hz with a coincidence of 10%.       The pulse-counting mode is used for all measurements except       solar occultations.

In this case the charge on each       anode is coarsely digitized and added to the previously       accumulated signal in memory.  The statistics of sampling these       events is complicated by the logarithmic pulse height       distribution of the events.  There is also a logarithmic       current limit function of the MCPs at the high event rates that       normally obtain when this mode is used.  Because both these       characteristics lead to non-linear response, modeling of the       detector response is needed to restore linearity.  The       integration mode is used for observing solar occultations.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:vg2.crs,COSMIC RAY SUBSYSTEM for VG2,COSMIC RAY SUBSYSTEM,"         Principal Investigator:     R.E. Vogt         The following section on instrumentation has been extracted       from the NSSDC documentation for the Voyager Cosmic Ray       Subsystem (Reference_ID = NSSDCCRS1979).         Instrument Overview       ===================         As its name implies, the Cosmic Ray Subsystem (CRS) was       designed for cosmic ray studies [STONEETAL1977B]. It       consists of two high Energy Telescopes (HET), four Low       Energy Telescopes (LET) and The Electron Telescope (TET).       The detectors have large geometric factors (~ 0.48 to 8       cm^2 ster) and long electronic time constants (~ 24       [micro]sec) for low power consumption and good stability.       Normally, the data are primarily derived from       comprehensive ([Delta]E[1], [Delta]E[2] and E) pulse-       height information about individual events. Because of the       high particle fluxes encountered at Jupiter and Saturn,       greater reliance had to be placed on counting rates in       single detectors and various coincidence rates. In       interplanetary space, guard counters are placed in       anticoincidence with the primary detectors to reduce the       background from high-energy particles penetrating through       the sides of the telescopes. These guard counters were       turned off in the Jovian magnetosphere when the accidental       anticoincidence rate became high enough to block a       substantial fraction of the desired counts. Fortunately,       under these conditions the spectra were sufficiently soft       that the background, due to penetrating particles, was       small.         The data on proton and ion fluxes at Jupiter were obtained       with the LET. The thicknesses of individual solid-state       detectors in the LET and their trigger thresholds were       chosen such that, even in the Jovian magnetosphere,       electrons made, at most, a very minor contribution to the       proton counting rates [LUPTON&STONE1972]. Dead time       corrections and accidental coincidences were small (< 20%)       throughout most of the magnetotail, but were substantial (>       50%) at flux maxima within 40 R[J] Of Jupiter. Data have       been included in this package for those periods when the       corrections are less than ~ 50% and can be corrected by the       user with the dead time appropriate to the detector (2 to       25 [micro]sec). The high counting rates, however, caused       some baseline shift which may have raised proton thresholds       significantly. In the inner magnetosphere, the L[2]       counting rate was still useful because it never rolled       over. This rate is due to 1.8- to 13-MeV protons       penetrating L[1] (0.43 cm^2 ster) and > 9-MeV protons       penetrating the shield (8.4 cm^2 ster). For an E^-2       spectrum, the two groups would make comparable       contributions; but in the magnetosphere, for the E^-3 to       E^-4 spectrum above 2.5 MeV [MCDONALDETAL1979], the       contribution from protons penetrating the shield would be       only 3 to 14%.         The LET L[1]L[2]L[4] and L[1]L[2]L[3] coincidence-       anticoincidence rates give the proton flux between 1.8 and       8 MeV and 3 to 8 MeV with a small alpha particle       contribution (~ 10^-3). Corrections are required for dead       time losses in L[1], accidental L[1]L[2] coincidences and       anticoincidence losses from L[4]. Data are given only for       periods when these corrections are relatively small. The       energy lost in detectors L[1], L[2] and L[3] was measured       for individual particles. For protons, this covered the       energy range from 0.42 to 8.3 MeV. Protons can be       identified positively by the [Delta]E vs. E technique,       their spectra obtained and accidental coincidences greatly       reduced. Because of telemetry limitations, however, only a       small fraction of the events could be transmitted, and       statistics become poor unless pulse-height data are       averaged over a period of one hour.         HET and LET detectors share the same data lines and pulse-       height analyzers; thus, the telescopes can interfere with       one another during periods of high counting rates. To       prevent such an interference and explore different       coincidence conditions, the experiment was cycled through       four operating modes, each 192 seconds long. Either the       HETs or the LETs were turned on at a time. LET-D was cycled       through L[1] only and L[1]L[2] coincidence requirements.       The TET was cycled through various coincidence conditions,       including singles from the front detectors. At the expense       of some time resolution, this procedure permitted us to       obtain significant data in the outer magnetosphere and       excellent data during the long passage through the       magnetotail region. Some of the published results from this       experiment required extensive corrections for dead time,       accidental coincidences and anticoincidences       ([VOGTETAL1979A], [VOGTETAL1979B]; [SCHARDTETAL1981];       [GEHRELSETAL1981]). These corrections can be applied only       on a case-by-case basis after a careful study of the       environment and many self-consistency checks. They cannot       be applied on a systematic basis and we have no computer       programs to do so; therefore, data from such periods are       not included in the Data Center submission. The scientists       on the CRS team will, however, be glad to consider special       requests if the desired information can be extracted from       the data.

The Voyager 2 spacecraft was built by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).                       Its mass was 815 kilograms, including its own power, propulsion, and                             communications systems and its own science instruments.                                Spacecraft electrical power was supplied by Radioisotope                               Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs) that produced about 400 watts.                        The Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS),                                Computer Command Subsystem (CCS), and Flight Data Subsystem                            (FDS) managed spacecraft operations.  Thrusters and gyroscopes                             provided physical propulsion and attitude control.                                     Communications between the spacecraft and Earth were carried                           out via a high-gain radio antenna using both S-band and X-band                         frequencies at data rates as high as 115.2 kilobits per second.                        A Digital Tape Recorder (DTR) could save up to 500 million bits                        when no Earth station was available for real-time data                                 transmission.  Voyager control systems could record sets of                            several thousand instructions, allowing autonomous operation                           for days or weeks at a time.  Many of the systems were equipped             with sensors, which fed engineering data to the ground where             status and performance could be monitored.                          The spacecraft itself was built around its 'bus' -- a decagonal                        prism, which was about 2 meters in diameter and about 60 cm                            deep.  Each of the ten sides of the bus was associated with a                          'bay' containing engineering systems or science instrument                             electronics.  Bay 1, for example, contained the radio                                  transmitter.  The High-Gain Antenna (HGA) was mounted to the                           end of the bus facing Earth.  The bays were numbered 1 through                         10 in a clockwise direction when viewed from Earth.  Extending                         away from the bus were three booms: a science boom and scan                            platform to which most instruments were mounted, a magnetometer                        boom, and a boom to which the RTGs were mounted.                                                    Spacecraft Coordinate System                                                           ----------------------------                                                           The centerline of the bus was the roll axis of the                                   spacecraft; it also served as the z-axis of the spacecraft                           coordinate system with the high-gain antenna (HGA) boresight                         defining the negative z-direction.  The HGA boresight was                            also defined as cone angle 0 degrees and as azimuth 180                              degrees, elevation 7 degrees.  The science boom, supporting                          the scan platform, extended in the general direction of                              positive y; this boom was also defined as being at cone angle                        90 degrees, clock angle 215 degrees and at azimuth 180                               degrees, elevation 97 degrees.  The boom supporting the RTGs                           was mounted on the bus in generally the negative y direction.                        The positive y-axis (yaw axis) of the spacecraft coordinate                          system passed through Bay 3; the negative y-axis passed                              through Bay 8.  The x-axis (pitch axis) was in a direction                           which defined a right-handed rectangular coordinate system.                          The positive x-axis was at cone angle 90 degrees, clock angle                        305 degrees (azimuth 270 degrees, elevation 90 degrees).                                          Telecommunications Subsystem                                                           ----------------------------                                                           The high-gain antenna was mounted to the spacecraft bus,                             pointing in the negative z-direction.  It was a parabolic                            reflector 3.7 meters in diameter with a feed that permitted                          simultaneous operation at both S-band (13 cm wavelength) and                         X-band (3.6 cm).  The half-power full-width of the antenna                           beam was 0.6 degrees at X-band and 2.3 degrees at S-band.                            The Low-Gain Antenna (LGA) was mounted on the feed structure                         of the HGA and radiated approximately uniformly over the                             hemisphere into which the HGA pointed.                                                            The Telecommunications Subsystem (TCS) electronics included a                        redundant pair of transponders, meaning that a failed                                functional unit in one transponder could be bypassed by                              swapping to the redundant unit.  The TCS could transmit                              science data on the X-band link at rates between 4.8 and                             115.2 kilobits per second and engineering data on the S-band                         link at 40 bits per second.  It could receive instructions                           sent (uplinked) from ground stations at a rate of 16 bits per                        second.  Commands were extracted from the uplink signal by                           the Command Detector Unit (CDU) and were then sent to the                            Computer Command Subsystem (CCS).                                                                 Spacecraft receivers were designed to lock to the uplink                             signal.  Without locking, Doppler effects -- resulting from                          relative motion of the spacecraft and ground station -- could                        result in loss of the radio link as the frequency of the                             received signal drifted. Voyager 2 differed from Voyager 1             in this locking mechanism, which failed after launch.  Although             lock could be achieved, the uplink signal had to be within a             window only 100 Hz wide around the Voyager 2 receiver's rest             frequency.  Engineers discovered both the problem and the             solution during cruise and were able to tune the uplink             transmitted from the ground so that commands could be sent             and data received for encounters with all four of the              Voyager 2 target planets.                          Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem                                            -------------------------------------------                                            The Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS)                               provided three-axis-stabilized control so that the spacecraft                        could maintain a fixed orientation in space.  Attitude                               control was accomplished using gyroscopes or by celestial                            reference.  The AACS also controlled motion of the scan                              platform, upon which the four 'remote sensing' instruments                           were mounted.                                                                                     Gyro control was used in special situations (e.g., trajectory                        corrections and solar conjunctions) for periods of up to                             several days.  The inertial reference unit operated with                             tuned rotor gyros having an uncalibrated drift rate of less                          than 0.5 degrees per hour and a calibrated drift rate of less                        than 0.05 degrees per hour.                                                                       Celestial control was based on viewing the Sun (through a                            sensor mounted on the high-gain antenna) and a single bright                         star (through a second sensor named the Canopus Star Tracker,                        after the star used most frequently as the reference).  When                         the spacecraft attitude drifted by more than a small amount                          from the reference objects, the AACS fired small thrusters                           which returned the spacecraft to the proper orientation.  The                        Sun sensor was an optical potentiometer with a cadmium                               sulfide detector; its error was less than 0.01 degrees and                           its limit cycle was +/-0.05 degrees.  The Canopus Star                               Tracker was an image dissector tube with a cesium detector,                          an error of less than 0.01 degree, and a limit cycle of                              +/-0.05 degrees.                                                                                  Redundant (backup) sun sensors, star trackers, and computers                         were also part of the AACS.  The non-redundant portions of                           the AACS were those controlling the pointing of the                                  instrument scan platform, which had two degrees of freedom --                        elevation and azimuth (see below).                          Propulsion Subsystem                                                                   --------------------                                                                   The propulsion system was part of the AACS and consisted of                          16 hydrazine thrusters.  These thrusters were also used to                           control the three-axis stabilization of the spacecraft.  Two                         thrusters on opposite sides of the spacecraft were used to                           perform positive roll turns around the +Z axis.  Two                                 oppositely pointed thrusters were used to perform negative                           roll turns.  One thruster was used to perform positive yaw                           turns (around the +Y axis) and one was used to perform                               negative yaw turns.  One thruster was used to perform                                positive pitch turns (around the +X axis) and one was used to                        perform negative pitch turns.  A backup hydrazine system was                         connected to a redundant set of eight thrusters.                                                  Power Subsystem                                                                        ---------------                                                                        Spacecraft power was provided by three Radioisotope                                  Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs) mounted on a boom in the                            negative y-direction.  At Launch the three RTGs converted                            7000 watts of heat into 475 watts of electrical power.  RTG                          electrical output decreased by about 7 watts per year because                        of decay of the plutonium dioxide fissionable material and                           degradation of the silicon-germanium thermocouples.  The                             difference between available electrical power and the power                          required to operate spacecraft subsystems was called the                             'power margin.' Voyager Project guidelines required a power                          margin of at least 12 watts to guard against electrical                              transients and miscalculations; excess electrical power was                          dissipated as heat in a shunt radiator.                                                           Data Storage Subsystem                                                                 ----------------------                                                                 The Digital Tape Recorder (DTR) was used to store data when                          real-time communications with Earth were either not possible                         or not scheduled.  The DTR recorded data on eight tracks;                            rates were 115.2 kilobits per second (record only), 21.6                             kilobits per second (playback only), and 7.2 kilobits per                            second (record and playback).  Capacity of each track was 12                         images or equivalent.                                                                             Computer Command Subsystem                                                             --------------------------                                                             The Computer Command Subsystem (CCS) consisted of two                                identical computer processors, their software algorithms, and                        associated electronic hardware.  The CCS was the central                             controller of the spacecraft.  During most of the Voyager                            mission the two CCS computers on each spacecraft were used                           non-redundantly to increase the command and processing                               capability of the spacecraft.                                                                     Flight Data Subsystem                                                                  ---------------------                                                                  The Flight Data Subsystem (FDS) consisted of two                                     reprogrammable digital computers and associated encoding                             hardware.  The FDS collected and formatted science and                               engineering telemetry data for transmission to Earth.                                Convolutional coding was imposed on all data transmitted from                        the spacecraft.  Additionally, both Golay encoding and Reed-                         Solomon encoding were available for use on spacecraft data.                          Data compression was also performed within the FDS.                                               Science Boom                                                                           ------------                                                                           The Voyager science instrument boom carried the plasma                               detector, cosmic ray detector and the low energy charged                             particle detector.  The scan platform was mounted on the                             science boom.                                                                                     Scan Platform                                                                          -------------                                                                          Four instruments (Imaging, PhotoPolarimeter, Infra-Red                               Interferometric Spectrometer, and Ultra Violet Spectrometer)                         were mounted on the scan platform, which could be slewed by                          motors and gears (called actuators).  Elevation of the scan                          platform was measured with respect to a plane slightly offset                        (by approximately 7 degrees) from the spacecraft x-z plane;                          the spacecraft positive y-axis was at 97 degrees elevation                           (see Spacecraft Coordinate System above).  The scan platform                         azimuth reference was defined by the y-z plane, with zero                            azimuth being in the negative z-direction.  Drive actuators                          were controlled by fine feedback potentiometers; the error of                        each was less than 0.03 degrees, and the final pointing error                        of the scan platform was nominally +/-0.1 degrees (2-sigma                           per axis).  Subsequent analysis by the Navigation and                                Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF) at JPL showed larger                        errors during at least the Jupiter and Saturn encounters.                            High rate slews of 1 deg/sec were discontinued after the                             azimuth drive mechanism on Voyager 2 temporarily froze a                             short time after Saturn closest approach.  The medium slew                           rate was 0.33 deg/sec, and the low slew rate was 0.08                                deg/sec.

One low-field magnetometer was mounted at the end of                        the boom and a second was mounted about 3 meters from the                            end.  Two high-field magnetometers were mounted at the base                          of the boom.

The two components of the instrument share a 50 cm       Cassegrain telescope with an effective focal length of 303.5       cm.  The angular field of view is 0.25 degree.  Light passing       through the telescope is divided into two beams by a dichroic       mirror, with that longer than about 2.5 micrometers going to       the infrared interferometer and radiation between 0.33 and 2       micrometers going to the radiometer.  The effective spectral       range of the interferometer is 180-2500 cm**-1 (4-55       micrometers) and the apodized spectral resolution is 4.3       cm**-1.  The beam splitter of the interferometer consists of a       multilayer dielectric coating applied to a cesium iodide       substrate.  The moving mirror is mounted on one end of a motor       shaft; the moving mirror of an auxiliary reference       interferometer is attached to the other end of the shaft.  A       0.5852 micrometer neon line source is used for the reference       interferometer; the signal from this unit is used by a phase       comparator and digital sampling circuit to control the motor       speed and to quantize the analog signal from the main IR       detector.  The latter is a low impedance, Schwartz-type       thermopile with a noise equivalent power (NEP) of about 2E-10       Watt/Hz**1/2.         The spectral response of the radiometer, which is designed to       measure the broadband reflected solar radiation, is controlled       by the dichroic mirror and an additional coating on the       radiometer side of the mirror.  The radiometer detector is an       eighteen-junction thermopile with an NEP of 4E-10 Watt/Hz**1/2.       A sapphire window is placed in front of the detector to reject       unwanted long-wave radiation that may result from temperature       gradients within the instrument.  The signal from the       radiometer detector is fed to a low noise, low-drift dc       amplifier with a time constant of approximately 2.7 seconds,       and then to three different output circuits.  The first circuit       integrates the radiometer signal over the 45.6 seconds it takes       to record an interferogram, thus providing the average of the       reflected sunlight during the time the infrared spectrum is       recorded.  The second and third circuits provide the analog       signal from the radiometer as well as the signal amplified by a       factor of 8.  These latter channels are sampled every 6 seconds       and digitized.  The timing of the samples, and their       relationship to events in a single-frame read out of an image       are given in Table 1.                        Table 1.

The       relationships are:               For Voyager 1:                  Sampled data (normal gain):                   DNn = (WADn * 1e+08 - 2.51937) / 3.39426                Sampled data (high gain):                   DNh = (WADh * 1e+09 - 1.55472) / 4.26206                Integrated data:                   DNi = WADi / 1.42145 * 1e+09               For Voyager 2:                  Sampled data (normal gain):                   DNn = (WADn * 1e+08 - 6.33020) / 3.40070                Sampled data (high gain):                   DNh = (WADh * 1e+09 + 6.57589) / 4.24459                Integrated data:                   DNi = WADi / 1.42047 * 1e+09           Pairs of baseline levels are averaged at the beginning and at       the end of the 45.6 second integrations, occasionally resulting       in half-integral DN values for the integrated radiometer data.         Despite the stability of the calibration data (see below), a       small systematic error may remain.  Comparison of spatially       resolved IRIS observations of Jupiter and Saturn shows that       reflectivities derived from Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 IRIS       instruments are in the ratio 0.883:1.  An investigation was       made of albedos of various objects (Jupiter, Io, Ganymede,       Callisto, and Saturn), as determined using the two instruments.       When compared to groundbased determinations, no systematic       differences were apparent for either instrument, within the       uncertainties.  Thus, a systematic error on the order of 10%       may exist in the calibration of one or both of the IRIS       instruments' radiometer systems.         The temperature of the instrument is passively and actively       controlled to operate at 200 +/- 0.5 K with a maximum drift of       +/- 0.1 K/day.  A thermal radiator mounted on the       interferometer cools the instrument by radiating to deep space.       Three sets of proportionally controlled heaters provide fine       thermal control for the primary telescope mirror, secondary       mirror, and the interferometer.  It is necessary to maintain       temperature differences between the three components to less       than 0.1 K.  In addition, high-powered 'flash-off' heaters are       available for increasing the instrument temperature by       approximately 70 K.  These are controlled by command.  These       have been used to warm the instrument during cruise periods to       reverse a gradual change in the elastic properties of a       silicone compound in the Michelson motor dampers and       beam-splitter mounts.         Science Objectives     ==================       The scientific objectives of the Voyager Infrared       Interferometer Spectrometer (IRIS) investigation include the       following:        (1)  Identification and determination of the abundances of           gaseous atmospheric constituents;      (2)  Determination of the helium abundance of the           atmospheres of the giant planets;      (3)  Determination of the energy balances of the giant           planets through measurements of their total thermal           emissions and Bond albedos;      (4)  Determination of the three dimensional thermal           structure of the atmospheres of the giant planets and           Titan;      (5)  Inference of information on atmospheric dynamics;      (6)  Inference of the infrared optical properties of           clouds and hazes;      (7)  Determination of the temperature, composition, and           structure of the surfaces of satellites without           atmospheres;      (8)  Determination of the thermal characteristics of           Saturn's rings.           These objectives are accomplished through the analysis of       measurements of thermal emission spectra and broad band       reflected solar energy.         Operational Considerations     ==========================       The IRIS instruments on Voyager 1 and 2 operated normally       throughout the mission.  The infrared interferometers of both       instruments experienced a temporal decrease in responsivity,       believed to be due to a gradual stiffening in silicon compounds       used in the mirror mounts and motor dampers.  However, this was       partially reversed by using the flash off heaters to raise the       temperature of the instrument periodically during cruise       between encounters.         Calibration Description     =======================       In-flight calibration of the data from the interferometer is       accomplished using periodic observations of deep space along       with a precise knowledge of the instrument cavity temperature.       Use of the instrument temperature itself as a calibration point       was necessitated because the large size of the telescope made       the use of an on-board blackbody target impractical.         The calibration is carried out for each wavenumber interval       independently using I = B*(Tinst)*(C2 C1)/C2 where I is the       calibrated planetary radiance, B*(Tinst) is the Planck radiance       at the instrument temperature Tinst, and C2 and C1 are the       spectral amplitudes measured while observing the planet and       deep space, respectively.  This calibration technique requires       that the interferometer and all elements within its field of       view, including the telescope mirrors, apertures, and baffles,       be at precisely the same temperature.  This condition is       insured through the use of thermostatically controlled heaters.       To minimize systematic errors from possible small changes in       the instrument responsivity, the calibration must be updated as       a function of time during the encounter.         During an encounter, the deep space spectra for each day were       averaged and a time corresponding to the average time was       assigned to each average.  In addition to the daily averages, a       grand average of all deep space spectra was calculated.  For       each day a ratio spectrum consisting of the daily average power       spectrum divided by the grand average power spectrum was used       to scale the grand average instrument response to obtain the       daily response.  Individual spectra were then calibrated using       a linear interpolation.  The calibrated spectral radiances are       expressed in Watt/cm**2/sr/cm**-1.         Radiometer calibration consists of a verification of instrument       stability by repeated determinations of t(target plate), based       on observations of a diffusely scattering target plate mounted       on the spacecraft.  The calibration conversion to Watts at the       detector takes into account the detector response and       electrical gains.  Observations of the target plate were       carried out before and after each encounter with the exception       of after the Voyager 2 Saturn encounter when jamming of the       instrument scan platform caused the maneuver to be aborted.         The long term behavior of the target calibration data for the       two IRIS radiometers is presented in the following tables.  The       observed target signal, corrected for offsets, and normalized       for changes in heliocentric distance, has remained constant       within quantization uncertainties throughout the mission.  In       the absence of compensating changes in the target plate and the       instrument, this implies excellent radiometer stability.  The       arithmetic average of all target measurements, with a 1.5%       uncertainty, is adopted as the normalized target signal for       purposes of absolute calibration: 30960 +/- 460 DNi x AU**2;       this differs slightly from the published value 31152 +/- 312       DNi x AU**2 [PEARL&CONRATH1991].  The target signals for the       integrating, x8 sampling, and x1 sampling radiometer data are       in the ratio 24:8:1.       Table 2.

[2] Considers the larger of 0.5% (estimated maximum possible         nonlinearity) or the baseline variation as the         uncertainty.     [3] All uncertainties are considered uncorrelated in         calculation of the adjusted target signal.     [4] For Voyager 2 only, the adopted mean value of 30960 +/-         460 is entered for all cases in the calibration files.     [5] For Voyager 2 Saturn post-encounter, the instrument         platform jammed so the calibration maneuver was aborted.           Because the spectral transmission of the radiometer is not flat       across the bandwidth, further calibration requires knowledge of       the relative spectrum of each object observed.  The absolute       reflectance of the Voyager 1 and 2 target plates are 0.502 +/-       0.018 and 0.497 +/- 0.018, respectively.  A detailed       description of a technique for calibrating the radiometer is       given in [HANELETAL1981A].         Instrument Detectors     ====================       The detector of the broadband reflected solar radiometer is an       eighteen-junction thermopile with a 3 second thermal time       constant and is operated at a temperature of 200 K.  The       thermopile used with the broadband radiometer has a noise       equivalent power of 4E-10 Watt/Hz**1/2.         The detector of the infrared interferometer is a low-impedance       Schwartz-type four-junction thermopile with a thermal time       constant of 12 millisecond.  and is operated at a temperature       of 200 K.  The thermopile used with the interferometer has a       noise equivalent power of approximately 2E-10 Watt/Hz**1/2.         Instrument Electronics     ======================       The bulk of the analog and all of the digital circuitry is       located in an electronics module separate form the       interferometer module.  The power supply is located in still       another box.  Only elements that had to be close to detectors       to minimize noise, such as the sensors for temperature       measurements and controls, were located in the optics module.       The electronics box contains timing and control elements,       mirror drive circuitry, housekeeping monitors, thermal       controllers, analog-to-digital converters, and spacecraft       interface circuits.  The power module contains one primary and       two auxiliary power supplies that convert spacecraft primary ac       into dc voltages required to operate the instrument.  One of       the auxiliary supplies is always on to maintain the instrument       at the proper temperature.  The primary power supply is on only       when the instrument is on during tests, calibrations and       observation periods during planetary encounters.  Because of       the requirement to pass through the Jovian radiation       environment, hardened electronics components were used where       possible.  The bulk of the instrument electronics consists of       radiation-hardened integrated circuits.  A description of the       electronics, along with a block diagram, is given in       [HANELETAL1980A].         Instrument Optics     =================       The Cassegrain telescope has a parabolic primary mirror 50 cm       in diameter with a 7.62 cm hyperbolic secondary mirror, and an       effective focal length of 303.5 cm and an F number of 6.07.  A       dichroic mirror divides the beam from the telescope into two       separate beams, one going to the infrared interferometer and       the other to the broadband reflected solar radiometer.  The       telescope mirrors and support structure, like most of the other       mechanical parts of the instrument, are made of optical-grade       beryllium.  The primary mirror is gold coated over a nickel       plating.  The secondary mirror has an aluminum coating over the       nickel plating, and this in turn is overcoated with silicon       monoxide for protection.         Instrument Offset     =================       The instrument and the associated electronics and power supply       modules are bolted to the scan platform.  The telescope is       approximately bore-sighted with the wide and narrow angle       television cameras, and with the PPS and UVS instruments.         Instrument Parameters     =====================       The following instrument parameters are measured.         Sampled Visible Radiance - Series of 8 radiometer samples taken       during a 48 second data frame with the high gain channel.  The       quantity given is power at the detector in Watts.  (-1.0       indicates data off the planet).         Integrated Visable Radiance - The broadband, reflected solar       radiometer signal integrated over the 45.6 seconds that IRIS       data are taken within the 48 second data frame.  The quantity       given is power at the detector in Watts.         Thermal Radiance - Radiance (W cm-2 ster-1) within a 4.3 cm-1       spectral interval.         Instrument Modes     ================       The instrument possesses only one operating mode.  When turned       on the instruments acquires one interferogram every 48 second       data frame.  In addition data from the reflected solar       radiometer are also obtained every data frame.  The latter       consist of a measurement integrated over 45.6 seconds as well       as 8 samples of both high and normal gain measurements       distributed at 6 second intervals throughout the data frame.

The system consists of two       cameras, a high resolution Narrow Angle (NA) camera and a lower       resolution, more sensitive Wide Angle (WA) camera.  Unlike the       other on board instruments, operation of the cameras is not       autonomous, but is controlled by an imaging parameter table       residing in one of the spacecraft computers, the Flight Data       Subsystem (FDS) (Science and Mission Systems Handbook, 1987,       JPL D-498, an internal JPL document available from JPL vellum       files).         The original mission was to Jupiter and Saturn.  Voyager       surpassed expectations and Voyager 2 went on to encounter       Uranus and Neptune.  As the Voyager mission progressed the       objects photographed were further from the sun so they appear       more faint even though longer exposures were used.  As the       Voyager spacecrafts' distance from the Earth increases, the       telecommunications capability at each encounter decreases.  The       difference in capabilities from the Jupiter and Saturn       encounters and that at Uranus and Neptune was considerable.       The reduced telecommunications capability limits the number of       data modes that imaging can use.  Because of the diminished       brightness of the objects being photographed, longer exposure       times were used, many beyond the stated maximum of 15.360       seconds.  Longer exposure times were all 48-second increments       added to the maximum.  In addition, the camera was slewed in       order to avoid smeared imaging.  The light flood state (on/off)       was independent of the instrument mode.         Science Objectives     ==================       The overall objective of this experiment is exploratory       reconnaissance of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and their       satellites and rings.  Such reconnaissance, at resolutions and       phase angles unobtainable from Earth, provides much new data       relevant to the atmospheric and/or surface properties of these       bodies.  The experiment also has the following specific       objectives: observe and characterize global circulation and       meteorology; determine the horizontal and vertical structure of       visible clouds; characterize the nature of any colored material       which may be in clouds.         Operational Considerations     ==========================       To make full scientific use of the image collection it is       necessary to understand the radiometric and geometric       characteristics of the camera system and perform corrections to       the data.         Each Voyager camera is unique in terms of its calibrated       characteristics.  Each has intrinsic shading (spatially       non-uniform output DNs from flat field target) and exhibits       barrel distortions typical of TV cameras flown on previous       planetary missions.  Because of these characteristics, the       cameras were calibrated before launch.  The response of the       pixels to known targets, illumination, exposures, etc.  was       measured and Calibration Files were generated to remove       radiometric and geometric distortions from the flight images.       These Calibration Files and detailed information on their use       are available through the Imaging Node.         Calibration Description     =======================       The calibration program for the Voyager television cameras       consisted of three parts: (1) component calibrations; ('Voyager       Imaging Science Subsystem Calibration Report' July 31, 1978, M.       Benesh and P.  Jepsen, D-618-802) (2) subsystem calibrations;       and, (3) system calibrations.  In addition, provision was made       for in-flight calibrations.  Component calibrations were       carried out prior to camera assembly.  Important measurements       include spectral transmittance of the lens and filters, actual       exposure times and shading characteristics of the shutter, and       pertinent electro-optical properties of the vidicon.  After the       optics and sensor were assembled it was possible to run       calibrations at the camera, or subsystem, level.  Particular       activities accomplished during this period included radiometric       calibrations, focal length measurement, determination of the       modulation transfer function, measurement of the geometric       distortion, and calibrations required for color reconstruction.       System calibrations were conducted after the cameras were       installed on the spacecraft.  Important tasks included       measurement of the Field-Of-View alignment and verification of       the flat-field light transfer characteristics.  Noise       measurements were also made at the system level.         A method for in-flight verification of the radiometric       calibrations that were run on the ground is employed on the       Narrow-Angle optics.  It is very similar to the scheme used on       the Wide-Angle optics except that eight lamps are required.       They are located just within the field of view around the       periphery of the telescope aperture.  By either pulsing the       lamps or leaving them on and varying the shutter exposure time       a transfer curve may also be generated by using the calibration       plaque.  The method is identical to that described for the       wide-angle optics.  However, calibration data was collected but       no new calibration files were generated during the Jupiter,       Saturn, or Uranus encounters or their related cruise periods.         Although the INSTRUMENT_PARAMETER_NAME has been provided as       Radiance, the Voyager Experiment Data Record (EDR) data set has       not been radiometrically corrected, and thus images do not       represent radiance units.  In order to convert an image from       Data Number (DN) to radiance units, the image must be       calibrated.  Radiometric calibration files, and selected       radiometrically corrected images are available through the       Imaging Node.

The vidicon storage surface (target) is selenium         sulphur and can store a high resolution (1500 TV lines)         picture for over 100 s at room temperature.  The active image         area on the target is 11.14 x 11.14 mm.  Each frame consists         of 800 lines with 800 picture elements (pixels) per line,         i.e., 1 pixel =14 microns.  One frame requires 48 s for         electronic readout.  In addition to the normal frame readout         of 48 s (1:1), four extended frame-time modes of 2:1, 3:1,         5:1, and 10:1 are available by command.  Following readout,         light flooding is used to remove any residual image that         might remain from the previous frame.  At the end of light         flooding, 14 erase frames are used to stabilize and prepare         the vidicon target for the next exposure sequence (VGR ISS         Calibration Report, 1978, an internal JPL document available         from JPL vellum files).           Sensitivity       -----------         Calibration experiments show the gain map indicating higher         sensitivity toward the top of the frame in a generally radial         manner.  Dark-current ratio results indicate a mean within         plus-or-minus 3% of the true linearity of the light transfer         function.  The required accuracy of the light-transfer         functions was plus-or-minus 5% of half-scale signal averaged         over any randomly selected area of 10 contiguous pixels.         This requirement was consistently met for all Imaging Science         Subsystem (ISS) flight cameras.  The radiance of the used         light cannons was supposed to be plus-or-minus 5% or better         of the level to produce a half-scale signal.  This criterion         was also met.  It is not clear whether the color spatial         dependence is due to the vidicon, or whether the filters have         varying transmissions.  In the latter case, the ratios would         be independent of light level; and this has been observed to         be the case for all flight cameras.  Moreover, vidicons have         not shown scale variations of this magnitude in the past, so         that it is easier to believe that they are due to the         spectral filters rather than to the vidicons.  The color         sensitivity is sufficient to require a separate decalibration         file for each spectral filter, which has been done, but not         gross enough to cause concern about the quality of the image         itself (VGR ISS Calibration Report, 1978, an internal JPL         document available from JPL vellum files).         Instrument Electronics 'ISSN'     =============================         Description       -----------         The Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) electronics consist of         the vidicon support circuits and the signal chain.  The         vidicon support circuits are the vertical and horizontal         sweep circuits, and the various power supplies for the         vidicon filament, and the focus and alignment coils.  The         signal chain consists of the analog signal amplifiers,         bandpass filters, and an eight bit analog-to-digital         converter.

The system consists of two       cameras, a high resolution Narrow Angle (NA) camera and a lower       resolution, more sensitive Wide Angle (WA) camera.  Unlike the       other on board instruments, operation of the cameras is not       autonomous, but is controlled by an imaging parameter table       residing in one of the spacecraft computers, the Flight Data       Subsystem (FDS) (Science and Mission Systems Handbook, 1987,       JPL D-498, an internal JPL document available from JPL vellum       files).         The original mission was to Jupiter and Saturn.  Voyager       surpassed expectations and went on to encounter Uranus and       Neptune.  As the Voyager mission progressed the objects       photographed were further from the sun so they appeared more       faint even though longer exposures were used.  As the Voyager       spacecrafts' distance from the Earth increases, the       telecommunications capability at each encounter decreases.  The       difference in capabilities from the Jupiter and Saturn       encounters and that at Uranus and Neptune was considerable.       The reduced telecommunications capability limits the number of       data modes that imaging can use.  Because of the diminished       brightness of the objects being photographed, longer exposure       times were used, many beyond the stated maximum of 15.360       seconds.  Longer exposure times were all 48-second increments       added to the maximum.  In addition, the camera was slewed in       order to avoid smeared imaging.  The light flood state (on/off)       was independent of the instrument mode.         Science Objectives     ==================       The overall objective of this experiment is exploratory       reconnaissance of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and their       satellites and rings.  Such reconnaissance, at resolutions and       phase angles unobtainable from Earth, provides much new data       relevant to the atmospheric and/or surface properties of these       bodies.  The experiment also has the following specific       objectives: observe and characterize global circulation and       meteorology; determine the horizontal and vertical structure of       visible clouds; characterize the nature of any colored material       which may be in clouds.         Operational Considerations     ==========================       To make full scientific use of the image collection, it is       necessary to understand the radiometric and geometric       characteristics of the camera system and perform corrections to       the data.         Each Voyager camera is unique in terms of its calibrated       characteristics.  Each has intrinsic shading (spatially       non-uniform output DNs from flat field target) and exhibits       barrel distortions typical of TV cameras flown on previous       planetary missions.  Because of these characteristics, the       cameras were calibrated before launch.  The response of pixels       to known targets, illumination, exposures, etc.  was measured       and Calibration Files were generated to remove radiometric and       geometric distortions from the flight images.  These       Calibration Files and detailed information on their use are       available through the Imaging Node.         Calibration Description     =======================       The calibration program for the Voyager television cameras       consisted of three parts: (1) component calibrations ('Voyager       Imaging Science Subsystem Calibration Report' July 31, 1978, M.       Benesh and P.  Jepsen, D618-802); (2) subsystem calibrations;       and, (3) system calibrations.  In addition, provision was made       for in-flight calibrations.  Component calibrations were       carried out prior to camera assembly.  Important measurements       include spectral transmittance of the lens and filters, actual       exposure times and shading characteristics of the shutter, and       pertinent electro-optical properties of the vidicon.  After the       optics and sensor were assembled it was possible to run       calibrations at the camera, or subsystem, level.  Particular       activities accomplished during this period included radiometric       calibrations, focal length measurement, determination of the       modulation transfer function, measurement of the geometric       distortion, and calibrations required for color reconstruction.       System calibrations were conducted after the cameras were       installed on the spacecraft.  Important tasks included       measurement of the Field-Of-View (FOV) alignment and       verification of the flat-field light transfer characteristics.       Noise measurements were also made at the system level.         A method for in-flight calibration was also available.  It       consisted of a flat reflective surface which is located about 2       m from the camera.  A flat-field light transfer curve can be       constructed by orienting the spacecraft so the at the plaque is       illuminated by the sun and by photographing it at the proper       exposure times.  However, calibration data was collected but no       new calibration files were generated during either the Jupiter,       Saturn, or Uranus encounters or their related cruise periods.         Although the INSTRUMENT_PARAMETER_NAME has been provided as       Radiance, the Voyager Experiment Data Record (EDR) data set has       not been radiometrically corrected, and thus images do not       represent radiance units.  In order to convert an image from       Data Number (DN) to radiance units, the image must be       calibrated.  Radiometric calibration files, and selected       radiometrically corrected images are available through the       Imaging Node.

The vidicon         storage surface (target) is selenium sulphur and can store a         high resolution (1500 TV lines) picture for over 100 s at         room temperature.  The active image area on the target is         11.14 x 11.14 mm.  Each frame consists of 800 lines with 800         picture elements (pixels) per line, i.e., 1 pixel = 14         microns.  One frame requires 48 s for electronic readout.  In         addition to the normal frame readout of 48 s (1:1), four         extended frame-time modes of 2:1, 3:1, 5:1, and 10:1 are         available by command.  Following readout, light flooding is         used to remove any residual image that might remain from the         previous frame.  At the end of light flooding, 14 erase         frames are used to stabilize and prepare the vidicon target         for the next exposure sequence (VGR ISS Calibration Report,         1978, an internal JPL document available from JPL vellum         files).           Sensitivity       -----------         Calibration experiments show the gain map indicating higher         sensitivity toward the top of the frame in a generally radial         manner.  Dark-current ratio results indicate a mean within         plus-or-minus 3% of the true linearity of the light transfer         function.  The required accuracy of the light-transfer         functions was plus-or-minus 5% of half-scale signal averaged         over any randomly selected area of 10 contiguous pixels.         This requirement was consistently met for all Imaging Science         Subsystem (ISS) flight cameras.  The radiance of the used         light cannons was supposed to be plus-or-minus 5% or better         of the level to produce a half-scale signal.  This criterion         was also met.  It is not clear whether the color spatial         dependence is due to the vidicon, or whether the filters have         varying transmissions.  In the latter case, the ratios would         be independent of light level; and this has been observed to         be the case for all flight cameras.  Moreover, vidicons have         not shown scale variations of this magnitude in the past, so         that it is easier to believe that they are due to the         spectral filters rather than to the vidicons.  The color         sensitivity is sufficient to require a separate decalibration         file for each spectral filter, which has been done, but not         gross enough to cause concern about the quality of the image         itself (VGR ISS Calibration Report, 1978, an internal JPL         document available from JPL vellum files).         Instrument Electronics 'ISSW'     =============================         Description       -----------         The Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) electronics consist of         the vidicon support circuits and the signal chain.  The         vidicon support circuits are the vertical and horizontal         sweep circuits, and the various power supplies for the         vidicon filament, and the focus and alignment coils.  The         signal chain consists of the analog signal amplifiers,         bandpass filters, and an eight bit analog-to-digital         converter.  The digital output is sent to the Flight Data         Subsystem (FDS) for editing.

Electrons can be characterized, with       various electron rate energy channels, between 22 keV and       greater than 10 meV (mode dependent). Ions, without mass       species discriminations, can be characterized with various ion       rate energy channels between 28 keV and greater than 152 keV       (mode dependent). Rate data is telemetered as simple counts       per accumulation time period. The different channels       correspond to different onboard energy discrimination windows       (for ions the discrimination values are mass species       dependent, leading to some ambiguity). Above about 200       keV/nucleon, the ions can be discriminated as to their mass       species composition by the use of multiple parameter       measurements. These measurements consist of the energies that       individual particles deposit in more than one detector. This       information is telemetered both as ion rate data, obtained by       on-board species identification circuitry (with various       channels representing various energy-species combinations),       and as particle multiple parameters data, consisting of pulse-       height-analysis values from each of the affected particle       detectors for each analyzed particle. (A maximum of about 2 to       5 particles per second can be analyzed in this fashion due to       telemetry limitations. A priority scheme avoids saturation by       one species group. there are three such groups defined: atomic       number z = 1,2 each group in a rotating fashion.) Angular       information is obtained through mechanical rotation of the       detectors. The main detectors look within a single scan plane       that is rotated 360 degrees, stopping at 8 different look       sectors (one of the sectors is blocked to obtain a background       measurement: sector 8). The lower energy detectors have full       width viewcones of about 45 degrees. The scan plane is       oriented such that a line that passes exactly between sectors       8 and 1, and also exactly between sectors 4 and 5, is exactly       parallel to the roll axis of the spacecraft (which nominally       points at earth). When the roll orientation of the spacecraft       is such that the star sensor is locked on canopus, the scan       plane is tilted about 30 degrees out of the ecliptic plane,       with sector 3 tilting towards north ecliptic (and also in the       direction that is retrograde with respect to the planetary       orbits). Sectors 1 and 8 point in the general direction of       earth. The scan rate is variable between 48 seconds to 48       minutes per 360 degree scan. There are some electron detectors       (whose properties are not as well established as the others)       that view out of the scan plane described here (see       [KRIMIGISETAL1977]). Some of the data is subject to       substantial contamination depending on the region under       consideration. Before the data from this instrument can be       used, it is vital that the contamination descriptions be       examined ('CONTAMINATION_ DESC') for each contamination type       ('CONTAMINATION_ID') and that the contaminations levels be       determined ('DATA_QUALITY_ID' AND 'DATA_QUALITY_DESC'). While       sector 8 is the background sector for most (and generally the       most used) data channels, sector 4 is the background sector       for some channels. Of those channels documented in this       catalog, sector 4 is the background sector for channels: ESA0,       ESB0, AB10, AB12, AB13, PSA1, PSA2, PSA3, PSB1, PSB2, and PSB3.         Science Objectives       ==================       Characterize the energy spectra, angular distributions,       species composition, spatial structures, and temporal       variations of the hot plasmas, energetic particles, and       particulate radiation that exist in the vicinity of the outer       planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) and within the       interplanetary environment. To study the mechanisms by which       such particles are energized and transported throughout such       systems. To study in particular the energization and transport       processes associated with hot plasmas and particulate       radiation in the vicinity of planetary bow shocks,       magnetopauses, magnetotail plasma sheets, inner radiation       zones, the auroral zones, etc., and to study the interaction       of such media with planetary satellites and the planetary       atmospheres and ionospheres.         Operational Considerations       ==========================       Instrument operates continuously sampling data over uniform       accumulation intervals. The accumulation intervals are       different for the different channels of information (almost       100 channels). The scan head of the LECP Instrument usually       scans back-and-forth continuously (forward by 315 degrees and       then back by 315 degrees). The scanning head pauses at 8       different scan sectors for periods ranging between 6 seconds       and 48 seconds (for the encounter time periods) and takes       about 0.5 seconds to scan between the sectors. Specially       scanning modes for Voyager 2 at Uranus and Neptune have been       developed whereby 1 or 2 quick scans are performed followed by       6 to 12 minutes of no scanning. Also, for Voyager 2 at Jupiter       there was an extended period of no scanning. The roll       orientation of the spacecraft is of crucial importance as to       the type of data returned since that orientation determines       the orientation of the scan plane of the LECP Instrument. That       orientation also has safety consequences since a poor       orientation could expose the LECP detectors to ring       particulate damage.         Calibration       ===========       The instrument was calibrated on the ground by placing it into       beam chambers (e.g. Van DeGraf machines) and firing calibrated       beams of known composition at it. Also, a radioactive source       is positioned behind the 'sunshield' positioned at sector 8       for in-flight calibration of some detector-electronic gains.       Also, the instrument has a calibration mode whereby pulses of       known strength are sent into the pre-amplifier chains       following the detectors. Information about calibration can be       found in: [KRIMIGSETAL1977], [KRIMIGISETAL1981],       [ARMSTRONGETAL1981], and [HAMILTONETAL1981].

The       detector thicknesses range from 2 to 2450 microns to cover a       very broad range of particle energy and mass characteristic.         Detectors count particles that have appropriate discriminated       characteristics with an efficiency that approaches 1.       Therefore the sensitivity is strictly a function of the       geometric factors of the detectors (geometric factors       associated with different data channels are documented       elsewhere in this catalog) and the energy and species band-       widths of the data channels (also documented elsewhere). The       geometric factors have units of area X Steradians (CM^2 X       STR).

The multiple pieces of information can be used to perform mass,       atomic number, and/or charge state discriminations on ions. The       information can be discriminated on-board and telemetered in       the form of ion rate channels, or the multiple information       about each particle analyzed can be telemetered for obtaining       the finest species discriminations.

'LECP' Detector Operational Modes       =================================         FAR ENCOUNTER       -------------       Data Path Type                 : UNK       Instrument Power Consumption   : 4.725000         Used in the vicinity of planetary encounters. High intensity       detectors turned off (A, B, DELTA, DELTA PRIME). (Affected       channels are documented in detailed level catalog.) Bit Rate       allocated 1/3 for Particle Multiple Parameters (PMP) data, also       called Pulse Height Analysis data, and 2/3 for Rate data       (counts/second). Full composition discrimination capabilities       enabled (in both Rate and PMP forms). Angular scanning is       typically 6.4 minutes per 360 degree scan but is often changed.       Experiment Bit Rate is 600 bits per second. Electrons measured       up to 0.5 MEV. minimum sample time is 0.4 sec.         FAR ENCOUNTER STOW       ------------------       Data Path Type                   : UNK       Instrument Power Consumption     : 4.725000         This mode includes the Full Far Encounter Mode configuration       with the exception that the angular scanning is halted so that       the detectors are fixed looking into a non-standard direction.       This direction is such that the detectors peek around a sun       screen (which covers the sector 8 position of the scan plane)       having the effect of protecting the low energy ion and       electron detectors by reducing their geometric factors. For       the one application of this mode the geometric factor was       reduced by a factor of 26 for the low energy ions (Alpha       detector) and by an as yet uncalibrated factor for the       electrons (Beta and Gamma detectors).         NEAR ENCOUNTER       --------------       Data Path Type                 : UNK       Instrument Power Consumption   : 4.525000         Sometimes used at the closest-in positions during a planetary       encounter. The high intensity detectors are turned on (A, B,       DELTA, DELTA PRIME). (Affected channels are documented in the       detailed level catalog.) Particle Multiple Parameter (PMP)       composition discrimination capabilities are turned off       (including the rate channels derived from the multiple para-       meter information). All data appears in rate (counts/second)       form. Angular scanning is typically 6.4 minutes per 360       degrees scan but is often changed. Scanning cyclics driven by       the spacecraft computer are included. Experiment Bit Rate is       600 bits per second. Electrons are measured up to greater than       10 MEV. Minimum sample time is 0.4 sec.         URANUS SCAN CYCLIC       ------------------       Data Path Type                   : UNK       Instrument Power Consumption     : 4.725000         Data accumulated as with the Far Encounter Mode. Angular       scanning controlled by spacecraft. Two quick full angular       scans are obtained using 6 second scanning and lasting for 96       seconds total. In between these scan periods the sensors are       held fixed looking in sector 7. The scan periods occur every       12 minutes.         Instrument Mounting       ===================       LECP Instrument is mounted on the science boom about half way       between the boom's spacecraft anchor point and imaging scan       platform. The mounting is such that the 360 degree scan plane       of the LECP scanning head (not to be confused with the       scanning of the imaging instruments) is coplanar with the       spacecraft's roll axis. Also, on the Canopus star lock the       LECP scan plane is about 30 degrees rotated away from the       ecliptic plane. A line passing between sectors 1 and 8, and       between sectors 4 and 5, is parallel to the spacecraft roll       axis. Sectors 1 and 8 point in the general direction or earth,       and with the Canopus lock, sector 3 points generally in the       retrograde direction (referring to the direction with respect       to the directions of motion of the orbiting planets) and about       30 degrees north of the ecliptic.

The dual systems provide greater       reliability and, in the case of the LFM's, permit the       separation of the spacecraft magnetic fields from the ambient       fields. Additional reliability is achieved through electronics       redundancy. The wide dynamic ranges of +/- 0.002 G for the       LFM's and +/- 20 G for the HFM's, low quantization uncertainty       (+/- 12.4, 488 nanoTesla respectively), low sensor RMS noise       level (0.006 nanoTesla), and the use of data compaction schemes       to optimize the experiment information rate all combine to       permit the study of a broad spectrum of phenomena during the       mission.       Science Objectives     ==================       The investigations of the magnetic fields and magnetospheres of       the major planetary systems in the outer Solar System and their       interactions with the solar wind are primary objectives of the       space exploration program to be conducted during the Voyager 2       mission. In addition, the investigation of the interplanetary       magnetic field phenomena during the flights is of fundamental       importance both to the understanding of the magnetospheric       observations and to a number of outstanding questions in basic       plasma physics and in the general dynamics of the solar wind.       If the Heliospheric boundary is penetrated, accurate       measurement of the interstellar magnetic field is also an       important objective.       Operational Considerations     ==========================       There are no special operational considerations for the       magnetometer described in [BEHANNONETAL1977].       Measured Parameters     ===================       The following LFM and HFM values are derived from Table 1 in       [BEHANNONETAL1977].         LFM Dynamic ranges and quantization uncertainty:               Range (nT)               Quantization (nT)          ----------------------------------------------          1.  +/- 8.8                    +/- .0022          2.  +/- 26                     +/- .0063          3.  +/- 79                     +/- .019          4.  +/- 240                    +/- .059          5.  +/- 710                    +/- .173          6.  +/- 2100                   +/- .513          7.  +/- 6400                   +/- 1.56          8.  +/- 50,000                 +/- 12.2         HFM Dynamic ranges and quantization uncertainty:               Range (nT)               Quantization (nT)          ----------------------------------------------          1.  +/- 5E+4                   +/- 12.3          2.  +/- 2E+6                   +/- 488       Calibration Description     =======================       The 13 meter Astromast booms have proved in extensive       pre-flight testing to be highly rigid with respect to bending       motions but soft to torsional or twisting motion. Deployment       repeatability test have shown as much as +/- 7 degrees       uncertainty in the knowledge of the boom twist angle (about the       boom axis) at the magnetometer sensor positions, compared with       +/- 0.5 uncertainty in bend angles (rotation about axes       orthogonal to the boom axis). In order to minimize sensor       alignment uncertainties, a method to estimate an angular       correction matrix was developed that eliminates most of the       twist uncertainty and some of the bend uncertainty. A special       calibration coil has been wound around the periphery of the       spacecraft's high gain antenna to generate, upon command, a       known magnetic field at both LFM magnetometer sensors. The       difference between measurements taken when the coil is turned       on and off is the coil field, independent of all external       fields. Using a 20 turn coil of 1/2 amp yields nominal field       intensities 0f 33.4 and 6.1 nanoTesla at the inboard and       outboard sensors, respectively. All magnetometer data are       calibrated. Three types of in-flight calibrations are       performed: 1) sensitivity calibrations, 2) zero-level       calibrations, based on rolls of the spacecraft, and 3)       boom-alignment calibrations based on the activation of on-board       coils and resulting data (especially important when dual       magnetometers are used and in strong fields for any       magnetometer). Sensitivity calibrations (for 8 ranges) are       done approximately once every two months (early in the mission       they were done more frequently). The magnetometer team       generally use one or two axis rolls (cruise maneuvers, CRSMR's)       of the spacecraft for zero level calibrations as often as they       are provided which is variable this is about three times per       year for the so-called mini-CRSMR's, which are two axis rolls.       Full CRSMR's and z-axis (only) roll-maneuvers have not occurred       within the last few years (full CRSMR's and mini's differ only       in the number of rolls in each). The magnetometer team usually       succeeds in arguing for a series of rolls near each planetary       encounter. Boom-alignment calibrations were done once after       launch and around the time of the Jupiter encounter. Others       have been executed, but it has been determined that the       inter-sensor misalignment is small and constant. For more       information, consult [BEHANNONETAL1977].       LFM and HFM Detectors     =====================       Detector Type                  : RING CORE       Detector Aspect Ratio          : 0.000000       Nominal Operating Temperature  : 273.000000         Total Fovs                     : 1       Data Rate                      : UNK       Sample Bits                    : 12         The magnetometer consists of 6 ring core detectors. These are       designated as low field magnetometers (LFM) 1-3 and high field       magnetometers (HFM) 1-3. The basic sampling rate is .06 +/-       .006 seconds. Sampling rate for the high field system is .6       seconds. The detectors measure in the interval of +/- 2.0E+6       nT for HFM, and +/- 5.0E+4 for LFM. Nominal operating       temperature for all detectors is 273 K, though the sensors       were tested over a range of +/- 60 degrees about the nominal       temperature.         Both high and low field magnetometer sensors utilize a ring       core geometry and thus have lower drive power requirements and       better zero level stability than other types of fluxgates and       are smaller in size [ACUNA1974]. The cores consist of an       advanced molybdenum alloy, especially developed in cooperation       with the Naval Surface Weapons Center, White Oak, Maryland,       which exhibits extremely low noise and high stability       characteristics. The use of this alloy and the ring core       sensor geometry thus allows the realization of compact, low       power, ultrastable fluxgate sensors with a noise performance       that is improved almost an order of magnitude over the best       previously flown fluxgate sensors. The HFM's use specially       processed miniature ring cores (1 cm diameter) which minimize the       power required to measure large fields. This description is       taken directly from [BEHANNONETAL1977].         Vector Components       -----------------       The LFM1 detector and the HFM1 detector are designated as the       detectors which measure the i component of the vector (i,j,k).       The LFM2 detector and the HFM2 detector are designated as the       detectors which measure the j component of the vector (i,j,k).       The LFM3 detector and the HFM3 detector are designated as the       detectors which measure the k component of the vector (i,j,k).         'HFM' Section Parameter 'MAGNETIC FIELD COMPONENT'       --------------------------------------------------       Instrument Parameter Name      : MAGNETIC FIELD COMPONENT       Sampling Parameter Name        : TIME       Instrument Parameter Unit      : NANOTESLA       Minimum Instrument Parameter   : -2000000.000000       Maximum Instrument Parameter   : 2000000.000000       Minimum Sampling Parameter     : 0.600000       Maximum Sampling Parameter     : 0.600000       Noise Level                    : 0.006000       Sampling Parameter Interval    : 0.600000       Sampling Parameter Resolution  : 0.600000       Sampling Parameter Unit        : SECOND         A measured parameter equaling the magnetic field strength       (e.g. in nanoTeslas) along a particular axis direction.       Usually the three orthogonal axis components are measured by       three different sensors.         'LFM' Section Parameter 'MAGNETIC FIELD COMPONENT'       --------------------------------------------------       Instrument Parameter Name      : MAGNETIC FIELD COMPONENT       Sampling Parameter Name        : TIME       Instrument Parameter Unit      : NANOTESLA       Minimum Instrument Parameter   : -50000.000000       Maximum Instrument Parameter   : 50000.000000       Minimum Sampling Parameter     : 0.060000       Maximum Sampling Parameter     : 0.060000       Noise Level                    : 0.006000       Sampling Parameter Interval    : 0.060000       Sampling Parameter Resolution  : 0.060000       Sampling Parameter Unit        : SECOND         A measured parameter equaling the magnetic field strength       (e.g. in nanoTeslas) along a particular axis direction.       Usually the three orthogonal axis components are measured by       three different sensors.       Electronics     ===========     The instrument is composed of two completely redundant systems:     the 'P' or primary system and the 'S' or secondary system.       The experiment electronics instrumentation consists of the     flux-gate magnetometer electronics and associated controls, and     the calibration and data processing electronics. Complete     redundancy is provided for the analog to digital converters,     data and status readout buffers, command decoders and power     converters. Thus not only can the two magnetometers of a     system be interchanged, but considerable cross-strapping within     the electronics permits interchange of critical internal     functions as well. This significantly reduces the impact of     single-component failure on the ability of the experiment to     continue successful operation during the mission duration of     > 4 years.

Operational Modes     =================     Data Path Type                 : REALTIME     Instrument Power Consumption   : 2.200000       In the CRUISE mode, only the LFM subsystem is operating.     The basic sample rate in this mode is 50/3 vectors/second.       In the ENCOUNTER mode, both LFM and HFM subsystems are     operating. The basic sample rate in this mode is 50/3     vectors/second for the LFM system and 5/3 vectors/second     for the HFM system.       Instrument Mounting     ===================     The LFM is located near the tip of the magnetometer boom and     the HFM is located near the spacecraft body. See     [BEHANNONETAL1977] for a picture of the actual magnetometer     mounting positions and a complete description.

Ion currents are sampled simultaneously in       all four cups, electrons in the D-cup only.  The instrument       has an energy/charge range of 10-5950 V.  Data is taken in       four ways, high and low resolution ion modes and high and low       energy electron modes, with energy resolution varying between       3.6 and 29%.  The integration time for each energy channel can       be varied are used at Jupiter and Saturn and 0.93 and 0.21       second integration times are used at Uranus and Neptune.       Supersonic flow can be observed only when one of the detectors       points into the flow orientation allows determination of the       plasma density, temperature, and velocity.         Science Objectives       ==================       The objective of the Plasma Instrument is to characterize       plasma conditions throughout the Voyager trajectory, in the       solar wind and during the planetary encounters.         Operational Considerations       ==========================       Each detector has an effective field of view which is a cone of       half angle 45 degrees falls off quickly at higher angles.       Thus, for the instrument to measure ion parameters in a       Supersonic or Transonic plasma some of the detectors must look       into the plasma flow. Secondary ions and electrons produced       within the detectors can also effect the measurements,       especially if large fluxes of hot ions or electrons are present       and these effects are not well modeled. The instrument does       not measure composition, only energy/charge, so a model of       plasma composition must be adopted to fit the ion data choice       of models can be unambiguous for large Mach number flow (M>3)       but is non-unique for lower Mach numbers. After the Jupiter       encounter the highest channels of the A, B, and C detectors       often contain spurious signal and currents in the upper half of       the energy range should be examined carefully before use.         Calibration Description       =======================       The instrument was calibrated at MIT using ion and electron       beams and compared to output from other Faraday cups in the       same beam. Current levels are also calibrated in-flight by       injecting known currents into the detectors with the modulators       on and off. Much theoretical modeling has been done on the       response of the detectors to arbitrary plasma conditions.       Contact the PI for more information.         PLS Detectors 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'D'       ====================================       Detector Type                  : FARADAY CUP       Detector Aspect Ratio          : 0.000000       Nominal Operating Temperature  : 278.000000         The PLS instrument consists of four Faraday cups. Three of       these (A, B, C) are arranged in a cone whose central axis is       parallel to the direction of the telemetry antenna. The look       direction of each of these cups is offset 20 degrees from the       central axis. Detector D has a look direction approximately       perpendicular to the direction of the telemetry antenna. Each       detector consists of three modulator grids, six shield grids       and a suppressor grid in front of the collector. It measures       ion currents in the range 10-5950 V.         Depending on the integration time the detectors measure current       from a minimum of 3.e-14 to 2.e-13 AMPS up to a maximum of       6.e-8 AMPS. Sampling varies from .03 to .93 seconds.         'PLS' Section Parameter 'ELECTRON CURRENT'       ------------------------------------------       Sampling Parameter Name        : TIME       Section Id                     : PLS       Instrument Parameter Unit      : AMPS       Minimum Instrument Parameter   : 0.000000       Maximum Instrument Parameter   : 0.000000       Minimum Sampling Parameter     : 0.030000       Maximum Sampling Parameter     : 0.930000       Sampling Parameter Unit        : SECOND           'PLS' Section Parameter 'ION CURRENT'       -------------------------------------       Sampling Parameter Name        : TIME       Section Id                     : PLS       Instrument Parameter Unit      : AMPS       Minimum Instrument Parameter   : 0.000000       Maximum Instrument Parameter   : 0.000000       Minimum Sampling Parameter     : 0.030000       Maximum Sampling Parameter     : 0.930000       Sampling Parameter Unit        : SECOND         Electronics       ===========       Currents from the four detectors are amplified, filtered, and       integrated using four different measurement chains. A single       8-bit logarithmic A-D converter samples the four outputs of the       measurement chains and transfers the data to the spacecraft.       The high voltage modulator supplies a DC pedestal and a super-       imposed 400 HZ square wave modulation voltage. For positive       ions the modulator grids of all four detectors are driven in       parallel. A more complete description and block diagram of the       instrument electronics is available in [BRIDGEETAL1977].         Operating Modes       ===============       The eight operating modes of Voyager PLS are listed below.       Instrument power consumption is 8.100000 for all modes.         E1-LONG:  Low energy electron mode which measures the range                 10-140 V with 16 contiguous channels. The                 integration time for each channel is 0.93 sec.

Instrument Mounting       ===================       The PLS instrument is located on the Science Boom. The center       of the main detector cluster (A, B, C) points parallel to the       spacecraft telemetry antenna and detector D is at right angles       to this direction.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:vg2.pps,PHOTOPOLARIMETER SUBSYSTEM for VG2,PHOTOPOLARIMETER SUBSYSTEM,"       INSTRUMENT: PHOTOPOLARIMETER SUBSYSTEM     SPACECRAFT: VOYAGER 2       Instrument Overview   ===================     The Voyager Photopolarimeter Experiment (PPS) utilizes a general     purpose filter photometer/polarimeter optimized for the encounter     phase of the mission.         Instrument Id                  : PPS       Instrument Host Id             : VG2       Pi Pds User Id                 : ALLANE       Instrument Name                : PHOTOPOLARIMETER SUBSYSTEM       Instrument Type                : PHOTOPOLARIMETER       Build Date                     : NULL       Instrument Mass                : 2.55       Instrument Length              : NULL       Instrument Width               : NULL       Instrument Height              : NULL       Instrument Serial Number       : NULL       Instrument Manufacturer Name   : NULL       Scientific Objectives   =====================     From [LILLIEETAL1977], pp. 159-160.       The primary scientific objectives of the photopolarimeter     investigation on the Voyager mission were divided into three     categories---studies of atmospheres, satellite surfaces, and     rings.         Atmospheric Objectives     ----------------------       Specific objectives associated with the atmospheres were:         (1) to use intensity and polarization measurements as a       function of viewing angle and wavelength to determine the       macrostructure (vertical distribution of atmospheric aerosols)       and microstructure (particle size, shape, and probable       composition) of atmospheres;         (2) to use polarization measurements at large phase angles to       constrain the particle shapes and compositions within clouds;         (3) to search for dark side auroral emissions.         Satellite Surface Objectives     ----------------------------       Specific scientific objectives associated with the surfaces of       satellites were:         (1) to measure or set upper limits on the density of their       atmospheres;         (2) to determine the texture and probable composition of their       surfaces;         (3) to determine the bond albedo.         (4) to map the distribution of sodium vapor in the vicinity of       Io and in Jupiter's magnetosphere.         Planetary Ring Objectives     -------------------------       Specific scientific objectives for the study of planetary rings       were:         (1) to use intensity and polarization measurements of scattered       light as a function of wavelength and viewing angle to provide       information on the size, shape, and probable composition of the       ring particles, as well as their density and radial       distribution;         (2) to use observations of the extinction and scattering of       starlight to give additional information on particle size and       ring optical depth.       Optics and Detectors   ====================     From [LILLIEETAL1977], pp. 160-161.       The instrument consists of the following components:       (1) a 6-inch f/1.4 Dahl-Kirkham type Cassegrain telescope;       (2) a four-position aperture wheel providing circular fields of     view (FOVs) with diameters of 1/16, 1/4, 1, and 3.5 degrees;       (3) an eight-position analyzer wheel with open, dark and     calibration positions, plus with five polacoat analyzers with     transmitting axes oriented at 0, 60, 120, 45, and 135 degrees     rotation;       (4) an eight-position filter wheel holding thin interference     filters (see below);       (5) an EMR 510-E-06 photomultiplier tube (PMT) with a tri-alkali     (S-20) photocathode.       Individual photon events in the PMT are detected with pulse     counting electronics.       The wide dynamical range required by the mission (4 to 6.e11     photons /cm^2/s/Angstrom/ster) could be accommodated by FOV     changes and an electronic gain change in the PMT capable of     reducing the instrumental sensitivity by a factor of ~50.       A shadow caster prevents direct sunlight from entering the     aperture for phase angles < 160 degrees.  A solar sensor turns     off the high voltage if the PPS is pointed within 20 degrees of     the Sun.       Filters   =======     The effective wavelength of each filter, its nominal band width,     typical instrumental sensitivities, and the particular atomic and     molecular species to which it is sensitive are listed below (From     [LILLIEETAL1977], Table I, p. 164).

Operational Modes   =================     From [LILLIEETAL1977], pp. 161-162.       The planned normal operational (encounter) mode of the PPS was to     step through a programmed sequence of 40 filter/analyzer wheel     combinations once every 24 sec.  Each measurement was to consist     of a 400 millisecond integration period followed by a 200 ms     period during which the next filter or analyzer would be stepped     into place.  A full measurement set would thus consist of     readings in the open, 0 degrees, 60 degrees, 120 degrees, and     dark positions of the analyzer wheel for each of the eight     filters.       NOTE: Equipment failures and improved understanding of instrument     usage considerations, however, caused substantial changes in this     plan.  See the section on operational considerations below for     further details.       For stellar occultation and satellite eclipse measurements, the     experiment was operated with filters and analyzers fixed in     position and a 10-ms integration period.  This provided rapid     measurements in order to resolve spikes in the light curves due     to turbulence in the occulting planet's atmosphere, as seen in     Earth-based observations.       For ring observations, stellar occultations were observed using     filter #4 (2650 Angstroms) and polarizer #7 (45 degrees).  A     10-ms integration time was used to obtain maximum time resolution     and the FOV set to 1 degree.       Measured Parameters   ===================     From [LILLIEETAL1977], pp. 164-165.       PPS raw values represent the number of photons events in the PMT     counted by the detector during the given integration time.  Based     on FOV, filter, and gain settings, this count could then be     converted to an intensity.       Four Stokes' parameters, I, Q, U, and V, completely specify the     state of polarization of a quasi-monochromatic wave.  The     advantages of measuring and using Stokes' parameters are:         (1) They all have the same dimension of intensity;       (2) They are additive;       (3) From the Stokes' parameters it is possible to generate the           degree and plane of polarization and ellipticity.       Since the value of V is generally small and its measurement     requires a much more complex instrument, only I, Q, and U are     determined.       Total intensity I can be measured either with no polarizer in the     optical train, or by summing polarizers with transmission axes at     0, 60 and 120 degrees:             I = 2[I(0) + I(60) + I(120)] / 3 .       The Stokes' parameter Q is given by             Q = 2[2I(0) - I(60) - I(120)] / 3 .       Similarly, U can be determined from             U = 2[I(60) - I(120)] / sqrt(3) .       The PPS data readout consists of a 30-bit digital word, of which     20 bits provided the data count accumulated during the     integration period, and 10 bits indicated instrument status.  In     order to reduce the telemetry rate, data count bits were log     compressed in the spacecraft FDS to 14 bits (a 10 bit mantissa     and 4 bit exponent).  Log compression was removed from the FDS     for the PPS occultation modes.  The nominal data rate was thus 40     bps, with a maximum of 1023 1/2 bps and a minimum of 0.6 bps.       NOTE: Data obtained during stellar occultation observations were     not subjected to compression.       Calibration   ===========     From [LILLIEETAL1977], p. 161.       In-flight calibration was accomplished by observing a set of     standard stars of known brightness and polarization, the sunlight     scattered by an on-board calibration target (unpolarized light),     and the light from stars and the planets reflected into the PPS     from a mirror tilted to the Brewster angle (yielding 100%     polarized light).  An internal Cerenkov radiation source mounted     on the analyzer wheel provided a short term measure of the     instrument's stability but was not used because comparison     pre-flight calibration data was lost.       The instrument is capable of measuring the polarization of     reflected light from the planets and their satellites with a     precision of +/- 0.5%, and their relative brightness with an     accuracy of +/- 0.5 to 1%.  Absolute calibration is known to +/-     3% in the visible and infrared, and to +/- 10% in the UV.  For     measurements of low surface brightnesses the instrument's     sensitivity ranged from ~140 counts/Rayleigh in the visible and     UV to ~20 counts/Rayleigh in the infrared.       Further discussions of intensity and polarization measurements     can be found in, for example, [WESTETAL1981], [WESTETAL1983], and     [PRYOR&HORD1991].       Operational Considerations   ==========================     The PPS aboard Voyager 1 suffered extreme sensitivity loss before     and during Jupiter encounter.  This was deemed to be irreparable     and the instrument was turned off before Saturn encounter.     Voyager 1 data were never analyzed or archived.       The PPS instrument on board Voyager 2 suffered two hardware     failures that affected the ability to access wheel positions.  A     spacecraft decoder failure affected the analyzer and a PPS     internal chip failure affected the available filter positions.     At Jupiter, filter positions 0, 2, 4, and 6 were used.     Afterwards, only three positions, 2, 4, and 6, were used.  Four     of the eight analyzer wheel positions were available.  Of these,     135 and 45 degree orientations at wheel positions 6 and 7 were     used to acquire polarization information.  Before closest     approach at Jupiter, data taken are unreliable due to scattered     light.       Measurement sequences could be modified by changing the PPS     look-up-table (LUT) in the spacecraft's Flight Data System (FDS).     This controlled the filter and analyzer wheel positioning.  The     changes were predominantly a result of instrument electronic     failures and PMT usage issues more fully understood as the     mission progressed.  Knowledge of which FDS load was in effect     during each data observation is therefore necessary for proper     analysis.

The instrument was also     successful at observing solar radio emissions from the     perspective of the outer solar system.       Radio emissions can be used to determine the rate of rotation     of the inner core of a planet, to determine the existence of a     magnetic field, and to search for magnetic anomalies.  Radio     emissions are often the only remote diagnostic for interactions     occurring in the portions of magnetospheres through which a     spacecraft does not pass.  This is particularly true for the     inner magnetosphere, which usually goes unsampled.       Further information on the instrument and the investigations     performed can be found in [WARWICKETAL1997].       Instrument Description   ======================     The Voyager Planetary Radio Astronomy (PRA) instrument     consisted of two superheterodyne receivers, one for the range     from 1326.0 to 1.2 kHz (center frequency) and a second for the     range 40.55 to 1.53 MHz (center frequency).  The channels are     numbered so that the lowest frequency channel (1.2 kHz) is     channel number 198.  Channels in the range 1 to 128 are     referred to as 'high band', and the remaining channels as 'low     band'.  In low band, the channel spacing is 19.2 kHz.  In high     band, the channel spacing is 307.2 kHz.       The PRA receiver is driven by two orthogonal antennas mounted     on the spacecraft body.  Each antenna element is made of BeCu     hollow tubes 0.5 inches in diameter and is 10 meters in length.     By combining the signals from the two antennas in a 90 degree     hybrid, the PRA instrument can distinguish between the opposing     states, left hand and right hand, of circular polarization of     an incoming wave.       The Planetary Radio Astronomy (PRA) receivers were calibrated     under environmentally-controlled conditions and over the entire     frequency and dynamic range of the instruments.  This     calibration consisted in application of a known narrow-band     signal across the inputs and recording the receiver outputs.       The laboratory calibrations provided power levels for each data     number (DN) and each frequency in terms of known inputs across     the antenna terminals of each of the experiment's two     monopoles.  Calibrations were carried out over a range of     receiver temperatures, but in practice the stability of the     receiver as a function of temperature and the stability of the     temperature of the receiver as a function of mission phase and     the status of the overall spacecraft were such that a single     calibration for each DN at each frequency could be used.       Receiver output levels were quantized.  The minimum value for     the wave flux density was frequency dependent varying from     5.E-20 W M**-2 Hz**-1 at frequencies below 1.5 MHz to 5.E-19 at     frequencies above 1.5 MHz.  The maximum wave flux density was     typically 50 dB above the minimum value.  The instrument noise     level also was frequency dependent.  It was about 1.E-19 W     M**-2 Hz**-1 below 1.5 MHz.  The noise at 10 MHz was still     about 1E-19 W M**-2 Hz**-1, increased to about 1.E-17 W M**-2     Hz**-1 at 25 MHz, and then decreased to an intermediate value     at 40 MHz.       The low-band and high-band operation of the receiver differ.     In low-band the receiver operated with a sharply tuned filter     only 1 kHz broad at the 3 dB points and in high-band, with a     200 kHz filter.  The gain of the receivers was designed in such     a way that the output increased discontinuously by 23 dB     (corresponding to the 200:1 bandwidth ratio) between the lowest     frequency of high-band and the highest frequency of low-band.     This caused the instrument output to remain constant across the     high-band to low-band transition point if its input was     broadband noise.       If unpolarized radiation fell orthogonally on each monopole,     the total unpolarized flux density for signals below about 5     MHz could be roughly estimated to be       S = So (10**(m/1000)),       where m was the channel reading in millibels and So is       So = 1.5E-21 (W/Hz m**2).       No reliable method for estimating the flux density exists for     frequencies above 5 MHz due to the increasing effect of antenna     resonances.       Although the PRA instrument had 14 possible operating modes, in     practice the mode called POLLO was used more than 95% of the     time.  In POLLO, the receiver swept through all 198 channels in     sequence from the highest frequency to the lowest.  At each     frequency step, data were produced every 30 msec, consisting of     25 msec of integration and 5 msec of switching and settling     time.  Thus, a full sweep through all 200 channels took 6 sec     (including 60 msec for two status words).  Between steps the 90     degree hybrid was switched such that the receiver was sensitive     to the alternate sense of circular polarization.  This toggling     between left hand and right hand polarization itself alternated     with each 6 sec receiver sweep.  Thus, for a given frequency, a     pair of left hand and right hand measurements were 6 sec     apart.

GURNETT     PI PDS User Id                 : DGURNETT     Instrument Name                : PLASMA WAVE RECEIVER     Instrument Type                : PLASMA WAVE SPECTROMETER     Build Date                     : 1976-11-28     Instrument Mass                : 1.400000     Instrument Length              : 0.318000     Instrument Width               : 0.185000     Instrument Height              : 0.048000     Instrument Serial Number       : SN003     Instrument Manufacturer Name   : THE UNIVERSITY OF IOWA       The Plasma Wave Receiver on Voyager consists of both a     16-channel spectrum analyzer covering the range of 10 Hertz to     56.2 kiloHertz and a wideband waveform receiver which returns     the waveform of waves in the frequency range of 40 Hertz to 12     kiloHertz.  The spectrum analyzer provides data on a continual     basis with a maximum temporal resolution of one spectrum per 4     seconds.  The waveform receiver returns 4-bit samples of the     electric field measured at a rate of 28,800 samples per second.     Because of the very high data rate, the waveform samples must     be transmitted in the same manner as the Voyager imaging     information.  At Jupiter, some 10,000 48-second waveform frames     were obtained.  At Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, the number of     frames obtained was very small due to the lower telemetry rates     available at the greater distances of those planets.       Science Objectives   ==================     The primary science objective of the Voyager plasma wave     investigation is to make the first surveys of the plasma wave     and low frequency radio wave spectra in the magnetospheres of     the outer planets: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.     Plasma waves participate in a fundamental manner in the     dynamics of planetary magnetospheres and in the interactions of     that magnetosphere with the external solar wind and internal     perturbations such as those induced by satellites interior to     the magnetosphere.  Plasma waves also provide diagnostic     information about the plasma environment near the planets     including such parameters as electron density and sometimes     temperature.  The instrument is also sensitive to low frequency     radio emissions and, therefore, acts as a low frequency     extension to the Planetary Radio Astronomy investigation.     Radio waves are often the only means of remotely observing     regions of plasma not accessible to the spacecraft and also     lead to remote diagnostics of plasma conditions.  The plasma     wave receivers are also sensitive to the results of small dust     particles impacting on various parts of the spacecraft at high     velocities and, hence, provide a direct measure of the rate of     impact, the density of the dust, and an estimate of the mass     distribution of dust in the vicinity of the large planets,     especially those with rings and otherwise dusty environments.     Finally, the Plasma Wave Receiver will characterize the plasma     wave and radio wave spectrum of the outer heliosphere and     perhaps beyond, extending our understanding of solar wind     plasma processes and wave-particle interactions to several tens     of Astronomical Units.       Operational Considerations   ==========================     The primary operational considerations of the PWS include     maintaining the proper operating mode and obtaining waveform     samples as often as the spacecraft tape recorder/downlink     capabilities allow.  The standard instrument mode is with     Waveform Power On and Input Gain State Hi.  For encounter     periods, this corresponds to GS3GAINHI/WFMPWRON.  Since there     has never been a period when the signal levels were so high as     to require the Low input gain state, and it is highly unlikely     that such levels will ever be encountered, Low Input Gain State     should never be selected.  As long as there is power margin     available, it is most straightforward to leave the Waveform     Receiver Power on.  The power consumption is less than 0.5 Watt     for this section, hence, the power savings afforded by turning     it off is not large.  The most involved operational     consideration is providing for the transmission of waveform     data to the ground.  At Jupiter, the majority of the waveform     data could be sent directly to the ground via the 115200 bps     downlink.  This capability disappeared after Jupiter, however,     because of the greater distance to the spacecraft, hence, lower     telecon rates.  Since operating the A/D converter at a rate     less than 28800 Hertz would result in aliasing, it is necessary     to record the data at the 115200 bps rate on the spacecraft     tape recorder using the appropriate data mode and playback the     recorded data at a lower rate, commensurate with the link     capabilities.  Again, a choice of the proper playback mode is     required.  Since the data modes available on the spacecraft are     highly dependent on mission phase, these modes are not     described here.       Calibration Description   =======================     The Voyager plasma wave receiver spectrum analyzers were     calibrated by first establishing a relationship between input     voltage (of a sine wave at the filter center frequency) and     output voltage and second by measuring the effective bandwidth     of the filter.  The bandwidth is measured by applying a random     noise signal of known spectral density and by measuring the     output voltage which, by the first part of the calibration, is     related to the rms voltage of a sine wave.  Dividing the     equivalent sine wave voltage squared by the input spectral     density gives a bandwidth.  This procedure is repeated for each     of the frequency channels.  A special calibration problem     exists for the upper 8 frequency channels (1 kiloHertz and     above) due to a failure of a 'tree switch' in the Flight Data     System.  An in-flight recalibration was attempted by using a     Solar type III radio burst observed by both Voyager 1 and 2.     The recalibration has known deficiencies, but it has been     impossible to date to improve on them.  The deficiencies     include 'flat-topped' emissions where the emission appears to     grow in amplitude up to some plateau level and then stay     artificially flat for long periods of time.  The background     level for each of the channels can vary in step-level fashion     based on a number of engineering parameters which utilize the     same failed circuitry.  Other results of the tree-switch     recalibration is that the instrument sensitivity is decreased     by some amount which is not well known and the absolute     calibration could be off as well.  The calibration validity     could be a function of frequency since some channels' (mostly     the upper 3 channels, 17.8 kHz and above) calibration has been     verified with the PRA, but others have not and seem internally     inconsistent with the lower frequency, unaffected channels.       'PWS ANTENNA' Detector   ======================     Detector Type                  : DIPOLE ANTENNA     Nominal Operating Temperature  : 298.000000       The PWS uses a pair of 10 meter antenna elements as a balanced     dipole antenna.  The two elements are extended from the     spacecraft at right angles to each other.  (The elements are     shared with the Planetary Radio Astronomy instrument, which     uses them as a pair of monopoles so that measurements of the     degree of right and left hand circular polarization can be     made.) The PWS measures the voltage difference between the two     elements which, when coupled with the effective length of the     antenna system (7.07 m) yields an electric field strength in     units of volt/meter.  The antenna system has the usual dipole     antenna pattern which yields nearly 4*pi steradians in its     field of view, although there is a range of fields of view     where the detector response drops dramatically as one expects     from a dipole pattern.       The PWS antenna, used as a balanced dipole with an effective     length of 7.07 meters gives a sensitivity to fluctuating (wave)     electric fields down to the range of 5.E-6 volt/meter.  Even     though the antenna elements are extended orthogonally to each     other, the antenna pattern is still a dipole since the elements     are short with respect to the wavelengths of the waves.  The     presence of the various parts of the spacecraft in close     proximity to the antenna can result in a distorted pattern, but     this has not been studied in the frequency range of the PWS.       Electronics   ===========     The PWS electronics system consists of three basic sections.     The first is the power supply system which regulates and     filters the 28 volt, 2400 Hertz spacecraft power supply and     provides DC voltages to the remainder of the instrument     electronics.  The second section is the spectrum analyzer which     consists of two banks of 8 narrowband filters, and two     logarithmic detectors, each of which provides an analog voltage     proportional to the log of the signal strength delivered to the     detector from any of the eight filters it services.  The analog     outputs from these two compressors, as they are called, are     sent to the Flight Data System of the spacecraft for conversion     to an 8-bit digital value.  The spacecraft steps the inputs to     the two compressors periodically (once per 0.5 seconds in GS3     or encounter mode) so that signal strengths in each of the 16     channels is measured over a 4-second interval.  The third     section consists of a single broadband filter of 40 Hertz to 12     kiloHertz, an automatic gain controlled amplifier, and a 4-bit     A/D converter.  This section digitizes the electric field     waveform at a 28800 Hertz rate.  The output amplitude is     controlled by the automatic gain control in order to keep the     signals within the useful range provided by the 4-bit     digitization.

This is the normal encounter operating mode of the     instrument and places it in its most sensitive input gain state     with the waveform receiver section turned on.  The fact that     the waveform receiver power is on does not guarantee that     waveform data is available.  The spacecraft is in the GS-3 data     mode which cycles the plasma wave spectrum analyzer so that a     complete spectrum is obtained every 4 seconds.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:vg2.rss,RADIO SCIENCE SUBSYSTEM for VG2,RADIO SCIENCE SUBSYSTEM,"         Instrument Overview     ===================       The Voyager 2 Radio Science investigations at Neptune utilized       instrumentation with elements both on the spacecraft and at       the DSN.  Much of this was shared equipment, being used for       routine telecommunications as well as for Radio Science.       The performance and calibration of both the spacecraft and       tracking stations directly affected the radio science data       accuracy, and they played a major role in determining the       quality of the results.  The spacecraft part of the radio       science instrument is described immediately below; that is       followed by a description of the DSN (ground) part of the       instrument.         Instrument Specifications - Spacecraft     ======================================       The Voyager 2 spacecraft telecommunications subsystem served       as part of a radio science subsystem for investigations of       Neptune.  Many details of the subsystem are unknown; its       'build date' is taken to be 1977-08-20, which was the launch       date for Voyager 2.         Instrument Id                  : RSS       Instrument Host Id             : VG2       Pi Pds User Id                 : UNK       Instrument Name                : RADIO SCIENCE SUBSYSTEM       Instrument Type                : RADIO SCIENCE       Build Date                     : 1977-08-20       Instrument Mass                : UNK       Instrument Length              : UNK       Instrument Width               : UNK       Instrument Height              : UNK       Instrument Manufacturer Name   : UNK         Instrument Overview - Spacecraft     ================================       The spacecraft radio system was constructed around a redundant       pair of transponders.  Each transponder was equipped with an       S-band receiver (2115 MHz nominal frequency) and transmitters       at both S-band (2295 MHz nominal) and X-band (8415 MHz nominal).       Compared with S-band, X-band is less sensitive to plasma effects       by a factor of about 10; use of both frequencies coherently on       the 'downlink' allowed estimation of plasma content along the       radio path.  Use of X-band also significantly improved the       quality of radio tracking data for gravity investigations.         The transponder generated downlink signals in either 'coherent'       or 'non-coherent' modes, also known as 'two-way' and 'one-way,'       respectively.  When operating in the coherent mode, the       transmitted carrier frequency was derived coherently from the       received uplink carrier frequency with a 'turn-around ratio' of       240/221 at S-band and (11/3)*240/221 at X-band.         In non-coherent mode the transmitted frequency was controlled       by an on-board oscillator; the X- and S-band remained coherent       in the ratio 11/3.  A single Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO) was       used during radio occultations; it provided stabilities       several orders of magnitude better than the conventional       crystal oscillators, which were part of each transponder.         Stability of the Voyager 2 USO was specified in terms of its       Allan Deviation -- the fractional frequency deviation from       linear drift [ALLAN1966].  Over 10 minute periods, the Allan       Deviation ranged from 10^-12 to 4 10^-12 for integrations of       1-10 sec.  Long-term fractional drift of the oscillator was       about 5 10^-11 per day.  Although the oscillator was hardened,       there were discontinuities in the drift when the spacecraft       passed through the radiation belts of the outer planets.  The       equivalent microwave frequency of the USO at Voyager 2       Jupiter occultation ingress was:                        2,296,481,070.940 Hz (S-band)                      8,420,430,593.447 Hz (X-band)         Traveling wave tube or solid state amplifiers boosted the       transponder output.  Output powers of 9 and 26  watts could       be selected at S-band; the choices at X-band were 12 and 22       watts.         The signals were radiated via a 3.66 m diameter parabolic high       gain antenna (HGA).  The HGA transmit boresight gain of       the HGA was 36 dB at S-band and 47 dB at X-band.  The half-power       half-width of the antenna beam was 0.32 degrees at X-band and       1.1 degrees at S-band.  Transmit polarization was right-hand       circular at S-band and either right- or left-hand circular at       X-band.  A Low-Gain Antenna (LGA) was mounted on the feed       structure of the HGA and radiated approximately uniformly over       the hemisphere into which the HGA pointed.  It was used during       maneuvers, spacecraft anomalies, and at other times when the       HGA was not appropriate.         For receiving, the S-band HGA gain was 35 dB at 2115 MHz and the       polarization was right-hand circular.  The receiving system       noise temperature was approximately 2000K, the carrier tracking       loop bandwidth was 18 Hz, and the ranging channel noise       bandwidth was 1.5 MHz.         More information can be found in [ESHLEMANETAL1977].         Science Objectives     ==================       Science objectives fell into two broad areas of investigation --       those that could be met using high-precision radiometric data       (sometimes known as 'tracking' data) and those that could be met       from studying characteristics of the radio signal after its       interaction with an atmosphere, plasma, ring particles, or other       intervening medium.  The tracking data were fundamental to       inferring the gravitational forces on the spacecraft and       relativistic effects along the radio path; both the measured       time delay during a two-way transmission and the Doppler shift       were used.  Investigators seeking knowledge of atmospheric       structure, spatial and size distributions of ring particles,       and velocity of the solar wind measured amplitude, frequency       (and phase), and polarization of the radio signals which were       captured by Earth receiving systems.  There are, of course,       investigations which use both types of data.           Gravity Measurements       --------------------         The frequency of the downlink carrier signal was precisely         measured to determine the magnitude of the Doppler shift         caused by acceleration of the spacecraft as it passed near         either a single body or a system of bodies.  Since the         magnitude of the Doppler shift is related to the gravitational         field strength, the mass of the body (or bodies) can be         determined.  If the radius of the body is known (as from         calibrated images), the density can be calculated.           Doppler and range tracking measurements yield accurate         spacecraft trajectory solutions.  Simultaneously with         reconstruction of the spacecraft orbit, observation equations         for the central mass, low order coefficients for the field,         and a small number of ancillary parameters can be solved.         Measurements of the gravity field provide significant         constraints on inferences about the interior structure of         target bodies.           The Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft came closer to Jupiter than         Voyager, so there was no net improvement in the Jupiter mass         estimate from Voyager.  But Voyager probed the Galilean         satellites at closer range, and better mass estimates were         obtained.  The Voyager encounters with Saturn, in conjunction         with the close flyby of Pioneer 11, yielded a mass estimate         comparable to that of Jupiter along with several low-order         zonal harmonic coefficients.  Voyager 2 was targeted for a         close encounter with Miranda, an inner satellite of Uranus;         that, combined with long tracking arcs through the Uranian         system, yielded the first good estimates of masses for the         five largest satellites and an improved mass estimate for         Uranus itself.  The Voyager 2 very close near-polar flyby         with Neptune yielded estimates for the zonal harmonic         coefficients J2 and J4 in addition to estimates for the mass         of both Neptune and Triton.           Atmospheric and Ionospheric Radio Occultation Measurements       ----------------------------------------------------------         Atmospheric measurements by the method of radio occultation         contribute to an improved understanding of structure,         circulation, dynamics, and transport in atmospheres of remote         planetary bodies.  These results are based on detailed         analysis of the radio signal received from the spacecraft as         it enters and exits occultation by the planet.  Three phases         of an atmospheric investigation may be defined.  The first is         to obtain vertical profiles of atmospheric structure         (temperature and pressure in the neutral atmosphere and         electron density in the ionosphere) with emphasis on large-         scale phenomena.  During this stage, it is necessary to know         the mean molecular weight of the atmosphere; for Voyager         the hydrogen-helium mixing ratio could be determined for each         planet using the radio data in conjunction with Voyager IRIS         data.  Second is to investigate absorption at various levels         in the atmosphere -- such as by methane.  Third is to         study details of the structure, such as result from         propagation of buoyancy waves within a neutral atmosphere or         from alignment of charged particles along magnetic field lines         in an ionosphere.           Retrieval of atmospheric profiles requires coherent         samples of the radio signal that has propagated through         the atmosphere, plus accurate knowledge of the antenna         pointing and the spacecraft trajectory.  The spatial and         temporal coverage in radio occultation experiments are         determined by the observing geometry, including the spacecraft         trajectory.  For deep atmospheres, changes in antenna pointing         may be required to compensate for refractive bending by the         atmosphere.  At Jupiter and Saturn both diametric and grazing         occultations were obtained using the two Voyager spacecraft;         measurements were obtained at both equatorial and polar         latitudes.  Voyager 1 also obtained profiles for Titan.         Voyager 2 continued to Uranus and Neptune, and also obtained         occultation profiles at Triton.           Radio Measurements on Planetary Rings       -------------------------------------         Radio occultation measurements of planetary rings are carried         out using procedures similar to those employed for atmospheric         occultations.  Although absorption by ring particles must be         considered, the dominant effect on strength of the directly         propagating signal is believed to be conservative scattering.         Profiles of received signal strength can be inverted to yield         the radial distribution of ring material.  Doppler spreading         of the signal scattered in the near-forward direction can be         used to infer the particle size distribution, especially when         measurements at the two Voyager radio wavelengths are         combined.           Ring occultations were planned and observed at Saturn and         Uranus.  Measurements were carried out at Neptune, but no         rings or arcs were detected using the radio system.  A post-         encounter search for a radio ring occultation at Jupiter was         unsuccessful.           Voyager 2 also carried out an oblique forward scattering         experiment during its Saturn encounter.  The spacecraft high-         gain antenna was deflected from the Earth direction so that         it illuminated the ring system; but no scattered signal was         detected.           Solar Conjunction Experiments       -----------------------------         Solar conjunction experiments were conducted to improve         understanding of the structure and dynamics of the solar         corona and wind, to improve understanding of relativistic         effects when radio waves propagate near the Sun, and to test         the different elements of the radio science subsystem.         Approximately once per year, each Voyager spacecraft appeared         to pass behind the solar disk, as seen from Earth.  Radio         waves propagating between Voyager and Earth stations were         refracted and scattered (scintillation) by the solar plasma         [WOO1993].  Intensity fluctuations can be related to         fluctuations in electron density along the path, while Doppler         or phase scintillations can be related to both electron         density fluctuations and also the speed of the solar wind.         Many plasma effects decrease as the square of the radio         frequency; plasma effects are about an order of magnitude         stronger at S-band than X-band.           Experimental Relativity       -----------------------         The gravitational field of the Sun causes a time delay on         signals that propagate near the Sun of approximately 300         microseconds.  Although previous tests had verified the effect         to an accuracy of a few percent, Voyager measurements could         be conducted annually and at two frequencies, allowing         separation of plasma effects.           Gravitational fields of the gas giant planets also affected         radio signals by causing them to have apparent frequencies         lower than predicted.  The change in frequency is related to         the mass of the planet.  By measuring the change in frequency         as the spacecraft approached the planet, a value for the mass         could be calculated.  This value could then be compared with         the mass derived from two-way tracking data.  The spacecraft         Ultra-Stable Oscillator was used for these measurements;         two-way transmissions have nearly canceling frequency shifts         as the signal travels to the spacecraft and then returns.  The         dual frequencies available from Voyager allowed correction for         plasma effects along the radio path, but calibration for         radiation damage to the USO during encounters was more         difficult.         Operational Considerations - Spacecraft     =======================================       Descriptions given here are for nominal performance.  The       spacecraft transponder system comprised redundant units,       each with slightly different characteristics.  As       transponder units age, their performance changes slightly.       More importantly, the performance for radio science depended       on operational factors such as the modulation state for the       transmitters, which cannot be predicted in advance.  The       performance also depended on factors which were not always       under the control of the Voyager Project.         Spacecraft receivers were designed to lock to the uplink       signal.  Without locking, Doppler effects -- resulting from       relative motion of the spacecraft and ground station -- could       result in loss of the radio link as the frequency of the       received signal drifted.  Unfortunately, a series of failures       in the Voyager 2 receivers left that transponder unable to       track the uplink signal.  Beginning in April 1978, Doppler       shifts were predicted and the uplink carrier was tuned so       that Voyager 2 would see what appeared to be a signal at       constant frequency (to an accuracy of 100 Hz).         During deep occultations by the giant planets, the bending angle       resulting from refraction exceeded 10 degrees in some cases --       well beyond the half power beamwidth of the spacecraft antenna.       In those cases, the pointing of the HGA was adjusted so that       it followed a 'virtual' Earth and maximum signal strength could       be sustained.  These 'limb-track' maneuvers were critically       dependent on accurate timing in the encounter.  To protect       against timing errors at Titan (primarily from uncertaintes in       the radius and position of the satellite), no limb-track was       attempted during ingress while a fixed antenna offset was used       during egress.         Although the spacecraft radioisotope thermoelectric generators       were not dependent on solar flux for power, their output decayed       as the Voyager spacecraft moved outward through the solar       system.  During encounters with the outer planets, caution was       required in budgeting power and the high-power mode could not       be used for the radio transmitters.         Calibration Description - Spacecraft     ====================================       Prior to and during some encounter sequences, the spacecraft       was commanded to execute a 'mini-azcal' maneuver.  The HGA was       moved slightly above the Earth line then slightly below the       Earth line.  The procedure was repeated to the left and right       of the Earth line so that a 'cross-hair' pattern was mapped       out.  During the maneuver, the amplitude of the carrier       signal was measured carefully.  Analysis of the results would       show whether the HGA was pointed accurately and, if not,       approximately the error and direction.         Prior to and after encounters, the spacecraft frequency       reference was switched to the USO for several hours and the       carrier signal was monitored using equipment at the DSN.       These 'USO Tests' were used to calibrate the frequency and       frequency drift of the USO.  USO tests were particularly       important before and after the spacecraft entered a severe       radiation environment since the radiation typically damaged       the crystal and changed its characteristics slightly.         Platform Mounting Descriptions - Spacecraft     ===========================================       The centerline of the bus was the roll axis of the       spacecraft; it also served as the z-axis of the spacecraft       coordinate system with the high-gain antenna (HGA) boresight       defining the negative z-direction.  The HGA boresight was       also defined as cone angle 0 degrees and as azimuth 180       degrees, elevation 7 degrees.  The Low-Gain Antenna (LGA)       was mounted on the feed structure of the HGA and radiated       approximately uniformly over the hemisphere into which the       HGA pointed.         Principal Investigators     =======================       The Radio Science Team Leader through the Jupiter encounters       was Von R. Eshleman.  The Team Leader for the Saturn, Uranus,       and Neptune encounters was G. Leonard Tyler.         Instrument Section / Operating Mode Descriptions - Spacecraft     =============================================================       The Voyager radio system consisted of two sections, which       could be operated in the following modes:         Section      Mode       -------------------------------------------       Oscillator   two-way (coherent)                    one-way (non-coherent)       RF output    low-gain antenna (no information available)                    high-gain antenna         Selected parameters describing NASA Standard Transponder (NST)       performance are listed below:         Oscillator Parameters:                    S-Band     X-Band          Two-Way Transponder Turnaround Ratio  240/221    880/221          One-Way Transmit Frequency (MHz)        2296.      8415.

Each complex is equipped with       several antennas [including at least one each 70-m, 34-m High       Efficiency (HEF), and 34-m standard (STD)], associated       electronics, and operational systems.  Primary activity at each       complex is radiation of commands to and reception of telemetry       data from active spacecraft.  Transmission and reception is       possible in several radio-frequency bands, the most common       being S-band (nominally a frequency of 2100-2300 MHz or a       wavelength of 14.2-13.0 cm) and X-band (7100-8500 MHz or 4.2-       3.5 cm).  Transmitter output powers of up to 400 kw are       available.         Ground stations have the ability to transmit coded and uncoded       waveforms which can be echoed by distant spacecraft.  Analysis       of the received coding allows navigators to determine the       distance to the spacecraft; analysis of Doppler shift on the       carrier signal allows estimation of the line-of-sight       spacecraft velocity.  Range and Doppler measurements are used       to calculate the spacecraft trajectory and to infer gravity       fields of objects near the spacecraft.         Ground stations can record spacecraft signals that have       propagated through or been scattered from target media.       Measurements of signal parameters after wave interactions with       surfaces, atmospheres, rings, and plasmas are used to infer       physical and electrical properties of the target.         Principal investigators vary from experiment to experiment.       See the corresponding section of the spacecraft instrument       description or the data set description for specifics.         The Deep Space Network is managed by the Jet Propulsion       Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology for the       U.S.  National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

Subsystems - DSN     ================       The Deep Space Communications Complexes (DSCCs) are an integral       part of the Radio Science instrument, along with other       receiving stations and the spacecraft Radio Frequency       Subsystem.  Their system performance directly determines the       degree of success of Radio Science investigations, and their       system calibration determines the degree of accuracy in the       results of the experiments.  The following paragraphs describe       the functions performed by the individual subsystems of a DSCC.       This material has been adapted from [ASMAR&HERRERA1993]; for       additional information, consult [DSN810-5].         Each DSCC includes a set of antennas, a Signal Processing       Center (SPC), and communication links to the Jet Propulsion       Laboratory (JPL).  The general configuration is illustrated       below; antennas (Deep Space Stations, or DSS -- a term carried       over from earlier times when antennas were individually       instrumented) are listed in the table.             --------   --------   --------   --------   --------          | DSS 12 | | DSS 18 | | DSS 14 | | DSS 15 | | DSS 16 |          |34-m STD| |34-m STD| |  70-m  | |34-m HEF| |  26-m  |           --------   --------   --------   --------   --------               |            |     |             |          |               |            v     v             |          v               |           ---------            |     ---------                --------->|GOLDSTONE|<----------     |EARTH/ORB|                          | SPC  10 |<-------------->|   LINK  |                           ---------                  ---------                          |   SPC   |<-------------->|   26-M  |                          |  COMM   |         ------>|   COMM  |                           ---------         |        ---------                               |             |            |                               v             |            v              ------       ---------         |        ---------             | NOCC |<--->|   JPL   |<-------        |         |              ------      | CENTRAL |                |   GSFC  |              ------      |   COMM  |                | NASCOMM |             | MCCC |<--->| TERMINAL|<-------------->|         |              ------       ---------                  ---------                                                       ^     ^                                                       |     |                    CANBERRA (SPC 40) <----------------      |                                                             |                      MADRID (SPC 60) <----------------------                             GOLDSTONE     CANBERRA      MADRID              Antenna        SPC 10       SPC 40       SPC 60             --------      ---------     --------     --------             26-m            DSS 16       DSS 46       DSS 66             34-m STD        DSS 12       DSS 42       DSS 61                             DSS 18       DSS 48       DSS 68             34-m HEF        DSS 15       DSS 45       DSS 65             70-m            DSS 14       DSS 43       DSS 63             Developmental   DSS 13           Subsystem interconnections at each DSCC are shown in the       diagram below, and they are described in the sections that       follow.

The         DMC receives and archives most of the information from the         NOCC needed by the various DSCC subsystems during their         operation.  Control of most of the DSCC subsystems, as well         as the handling and displaying of any responses to control         directives and configuration and status information received         from each of the subsystems, is done through the DMC.  The         effect of this is to centralize the control, display, and         archiving functions necessary to operate a DSCC.         Communication among the various subsystems is done using a         Local Area Network (LAN) hooked up to each subsystem via a         network interface unit (NIU).           DMC operations are divided into two separate areas: the         Complex Monitor and Control (CMC) and the Link Monitor and         Control (LMC).  The primary purpose of the CMC processor for         Radio Science support is to receive and store all predict         sets transmitted from NOCC such as Radio Science, antenna         pointing, tracking, receiver, and uplink predict sets and         then, at a later time, to distribute them to the appropriate         subsystems via the LAN.  Those predict sets can be stored in         the CMC for a maximum of three days under normal conditions.         The CMC also receives, processes, and displays event/alarm         messages; maintains an operator log; and produces tape labels         for the DSP.  Assignment and configuration of the LMCs is         done through the CMC; to a limited degree the CMC can perform         some of the functions performed by the LMC.  There are two         CMCs (one on-line and one backup) and three LMCs at each DSCC         The backup CMC can function as an additional LMC if         necessary.           The LMC processor provides the operator interface for monitor         and control of a link -- a group of equipment required to         support a spacecraft pass.  For Radio Science, a link might         include the DSCC Spectrum Processing Subsystem (DSP) (which,         in turn, can control the SSI), or the Tracking Subsystem.         The LMC also maintains an operator log which includes         operator directives and subsystem responses.  One important         Radio Science specific function that the LMC performs is         receipt and transmission of the system temperature and signal         level data from the PPM for display at the LMC console and         for inclusion in Monitor blocks.  These blocks are recorded         on magnetic tape as well as appearing in the Mission Control         and Computing Center (MCCC) displays.  The LMC is required to         operate without interruption for the duration of the Radio         Science data acquisition period.           The Area Routing Assembly (ARA), which is part of the Digital         Communications Subsystem, controls all data communication         between the stations and JPL.  The ARA receives all required         data and status messages from the LMC/CMC and can record them         to tape as well as transmit them to JPL via data lines.  The         ARA also receives predicts and other data from JPL and passes         them on to the CMC.           DSCC Antenna Mechanical Subsystem       ---------------------------------         Multi-mission Radio Science activities require support from         the 70-m, 34-m HEF, and 34-m STD antenna subnets.  The         antennas at each DSCC function as large-aperture collectors         which, by double reflection, cause the incoming radio         frequency (RF) energy to enter the feed horns.  The large         collecting surface of the antenna focuses the incoming energy         onto a subreflector, which is adjustable in both axial and         angular position.  These adjustments are made to correct for         gravitational deformation of the antenna as it moves between         zenith and the horizon; the deformation can be as large as         5 cm.  The subreflector adjustments optimize the channeling         of energy from the primary reflector to the subreflector         and then to the feed horns.  The 70-m and 34-m HEF antennas         have 'shaped' primary and secondary reflectors, with forms         that are modified paraboloids.  This customization allows         more uniform illumination of one reflector by another.  The         34-m STD primary reflectors are classical paraboloids, while         the subreflectors are standard hyperboloids.

This discussion applies to both, except       in a few instances in which important differences between the       two are noted explicitly.  The Voyager 1 Ultraviolet       Spectrometer (UVS) is a compact Wadsworth mounted objective       grating spectrometer that covers the wavelength range of 0.0535       to 0.1702 micron (0.0513 to 0.1680 micron for the Voyager 2       UVS).  It records the entire spectrum within this range in a       single exposure.  It has no moving parts.  A mechanical       'collimator' consisting of a series of 13 aperture plates       defines the main 'airglow' field of view (FOV) of 0.10 degrees       degrees full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) x 0.87 degrees in length.       Light passing through the collimator strikes the concave       diffraction grating at near normal incidence.  The grating       disperses and focuses light onto a 1-d array detector that       records individual photoevents.  An auxiliary field of view for       solar occultation experiments is offset 20 degrees from the       airglow field by a small mirror near the front of the       collimator. Using this 'occultation port', the UVS can view the       Sun without pointing the main field, and those of other       coaligned instruments, directly at the Sun.  The occultation       field is 0.25 FWHM x 0.87 degrees.  A sunshade prevents       illumination of the main entrance aperture by the sun during       occultation observations.         The UVS has two spectral resolutions depending on the nature of       the source.  An extended monochromatic source that fills the       FOV ideally produces a triangular intensity distribution of 0.1       degree FWHM.  (The actual response function is slightly rounded       at the top and base, but a triangle is a satisfactory       approximation for most applications.) The 0.1 degree       corresponds to width of 3.5 anodes, or 0.0033 microns.  This       inherent spectral resolution may often be improved by spectral       analysis.  A monochromatic point source is imaged onto a width       of about 1 anode for a practical resolution of about 0.0015       microns.  Precise measurements of the relative response as a       function of position within the FOV have been made by rastering       the FOV across a star.  At wavelengths longward of 0.1350       microns there is a slight (~10%) asymmetry in the response on       either side of the center of the FOV.         The effective sizes of the entrance apertures are (airglow       port) 21.2 and (occultation port) 0.75 cm**2.         The anode array is scanned at a rate of 3125 scans per second       and the results are added into an internal memory.  The UVS       transmits the contents of this memory to the flight data system       (FDS) on command of the FDS.  The FDS retrieves values for a       pair of channels each 5 msec, and so reads a complete spectrum       from the UVS in 0.32 sec.  For the fastest transmitted data       rate (OC-1, see below) used for occultation observations, this       readout proceeds continuously, producing a series of spectra       separated by 0.32 sec.  For lower data rates, the memory is       read in bursts of 0.32 sec separated by the appropriate       intervals.  During these intervals, the UVS integrates the       spectrum in its internal memory.  As the data is transferred to       the FDS it is logarithmically compressed from 16 to 10 bits.         The FDS determines the rate at which spectra are read from the       UVS after being integrated internally in the instrument memory.       Most planetary observations are made at one of two data rates,       OC-1 (0.32 sec spectra, for occultation measurements) and GS-3       (3.84 sec spectra, for emission spectroscopy).  Slower rates       are used from time to time.  Rates and their designations are:             Name            Mode #           Integration time (sec)             OC-1            1                0.32             GS-3            2                3.84             CR-1            3                12             CR-2            4                48             CR-4            6                192             CR-6            8                720             CR-5T           9                240             UV-5A           10               3.84         A description of the UVS investigation is given by       [BROADFOOTETAL1977].  Performance and analysis techniques are       described by [BROADFOOTETAL1981].         Scientific Objectives     =====================       The primary goal of the UVS is to study the composition and       structure of the atmospheres of the outer planets and their       satellites.  Secondary goals include the study of       magnetospheric particle populations, magnetosphere-atmosphere       interactions, the composition and distribution of the       interplanetary wind, determinations of the solar flux, and       stellar astronomy.         Operational Considerations     ==========================       The Voyager UVS instruments have operated nearly continuously       since launch in 1977.  With the singular exception of a       decrease in the Voyager 1 microchannel plates (MCP) gain, due       to a high radiation-induced count rate during passage through       the inner Jovian magnetosphere, both instruments have remained       photometrically stable at a better than 3% level since 1977.       In-flight performance of the UVS from launch through the 1979       Jupiter encounters is reviewed in [BROADFOOTETAL1981] and an up       to date description of astronomical observations is contained       in [HOLBERG1990] and [LINICK&HOLBERG1991].         Calibration Description     =======================       Laboratory calibration of the UVS included measurements of:             1) sensitivity at a number of wavelengths throughout the              spectral range,           2) response to scattered light,           3) off-axis response, including collimator transmission              function, and           4) intrinsic dark count rate.         In-flight calibration has included assessments of absolute       sensitivity by comparisons with stars, and measurements of the       FOV response profile using stars.         Before the absolute calibration can be applied to a measured       spectrum, three or four spectral analysis steps are required.       These are flat field correction, dark count subtraction, and       descattering, and (sometimes) sky background removal.         Channel-to-channel variations in sensitivity result from       variations in effective count threshold among channels.       Applying a 'fixed pattern noise' (FPN) correction adjusts the       signal levels to their equivalents for a common threshold in       all channels.  The FPN correction involves a channel-by-channel       multiplication by a correction spectrum.  The correction       spectra are different for Voyager 1 and Voyager 2.  In fact,       two spectra are in use for Voyager 1.  The first is used for       data acquired before Jupiter encounter and the second for data       after encounter.  The two differ to account for changes in the       response of the Voyager 1 UVS induced by its operation in the       intense Jovian radiation environment.         Channels 3 and 4 have large FPN corrections, i.e.  they are       less sensitive than the others.  Therefore the statistical       accuracy of the signal in these channels is lower than in the       other channels.           Dark Counts       -----------         In interplanetary space, detector dark counts arise mainly         from effects of gamma radiation from the radioisotope         thermoelectric generators that power the spacecraft.  The         count rate is about 0.02 counts per channel per second.  The         shape is approximately flat in wavelength, with a step near         the edge of the filter in the detector.  The shape is         accurately known from long observations of the calibration         plate mounted on the spacecraft.  Almost no photon signal         (except for a weak reflection of sky-background H Lyman         alpha) is recorded during these observations.  The absolute         level varies slightly with scan platform position, because         rotating the scan platform changes the shielding mass between         the UVS detector and the generators.  For data acquired         outside a planetary magnetosphere, subtracting a scaled dark         spectrum from a calibration plate observation is usually a         satisfactory correction for dark counting.           Within a planetary magnetosphere, the dark count rate can         include contributions from high-energy particles.  For lower         levels, scaling a calibration plate spectrum is again         satisfactory, but for higher levels the shape of the dark         spectrum changes and another method must be used to         estimate dark levels.  The best alternative is to use a         spectrum taken at nearly the same time with no significant         source in the FOV.  Satellite observations often fill this         need.           Descattering       ------------         Light scattered within the instrument illuminates channels         outside the ideal transmission function of the collimator.         The effects of scattering are removed by a process called         descattering.  Descattering is accomplished through the use         of a matrix operator, a 126x126 element matrix which         describes the response of detector channel 'j' to the         measured signal at channel 'i'.  This scattering matrix is         completely empirical, having been determined from laboratory         measurements of 50 individual emission lines covering the         entire passband.  Descattering is a linear operation.  Dark         counts must be subtracted prior to descattering as the         descattering algorithm is based on the assumption that only         photon events are present.  Descattering will also correct         for second order response.  Therefore, if the spectrum to be         descattered contains artifacts, such as anomalously high or         low counts in channels 3 or 4, a corresponding error will be         introduced in the vicinity of both the first and second order         positions.           Sky Background Subtraction       --------------------------         When the UVS slit is not completely filled by the disk of a         planet, the portion off the planet sees the sky background.         Fortunately, in the far UV the sky is generally quite dark         and diffuse starlight is seldom significant.  However, bright         emissions at H Lyman alpha, Lyman beta, and He 0.0584 microns         from the interplanetary medium (IPM) often must be taken into         account.  These lines arise from strong solar chromospheric         emission lines that are scattered from neutral H and He of         the local interstellar medium.  The physics of this         'interstellar wind' is complex and leads to emission which is         inhomogeneous in space and variable in time.  The IPM         responds to active regions of the solar chromosphere as the         sun rotates.  This means that the sky brightness as seen by         the UVS can change noticeably on time scale of days.  As with         instrumental dark counts, there are two standard means of         removing sky background: direct subtraction of an adjacent         sky background suitably scaled, if available, and         construction of a synthetic sky background spectrum.           Calibration       -----------         Calibrating the spectra converts them from count units to         absolute brightness units. This step has not been included in         the data processing because the correct procedure depends on         the type of source viewed. The data spectra represent count         rates after correction for fixed pattern noise, a background         subtraction, and descattering. Multiplying these spectra by         one of the calibration spectra converts it to brightness         units. There is a calibration spectrum corresponding to each         of the two source types, namely point sources and extended         sources.           Point Source: Multiplying a data spectrum by the calibration         spectrum VxPTCAL.TAB (x=1 for Voyager 1 and x=2 for Voyager 2)         converts the spectrum from counts/(channel) to         photons/(cm**2-Angstrom-time), where time is the integration         time of the spectrum.           Extended Source, continuum emission: Multiplying a data         spectrum that has been normalized to an integration time of 1         second by the calibration spectrum VxFLCAL.TAB (x=1 for         Voyager 1 and 2 for Voyager 2) converts the spectrum from         counts/(channel-second) to spectral brightness in units of         Rayleighs/Angstrom for a source that fills the field of view.           Extended Source, monochromatic emission: The finite spectral         resolution (about 35 A) of the spectrograph must be considered         in this case. For isolated lines (those that are not strongly         blended with emissions at nearby wavelengths) it is sufficient         to sum the channels that include light from the emission of         interest (about 7 channels) and multiply by the appropriate         calibration factor. This factor is the product of the         dispersion (9.26 Angstroms/channel) and the value in         VxFLCAL.TAB corresponding to the center channel of the         wavelength of interest. The resulting quantity is the         brightness of a monochromatic emission that fills the field of         view. For more complex spectra that include blended emissions,         the most accurate approach is spectral analysis by generating         synthetic spectra. This technique uses an iterative approach         to adjust an estimated brightness spectrum until the model         spectrum computed from it matches the observed spectrum. The         model can be fairly simple, but must include the triangular         transmission profile of the collimator and the instrument         sensitivity (calibration). The calibration factor described         earlier in this paragraph is the correct one to use for this         kind of synthesis.             Calibration and spectral analysis issues are discussed by         [HOLBERGETAL1982] and [HOLBERG1986].         Platform Mounting Descriptions     ==============================       The UVS is mounted on the scan platform.  The instrument is       approximately bore-sighted with the wide and narrow angle       television cameras, and with the PPS and IRIS instruments.  The       alignment of the fields is not perfect; the following table       gives offsets of the centers of the UVS fields relative to the       centers of the ISS Narrow Angle Camera fields of view.       Elevation is positive to the right within the imaging field of       view, and cross-elevation is positive downward.  The narrow axis       of the UVS slit is aligned with the elevation direction.

Photoelectrons ejected at the front of the MCP stack are       amplified by a factor of about 1E6, and the resulting charge       pulse is collected by the anode array.  The 128 narrow aluminum       anodes, each 3 mm long, are deposited on 0.1-mm centers for a       collecting length (in the dispersion direction) of 13 mm.         The anodes are accessed sequentially by a shift register and       FET switches contained on the single integrated circuit.  The       scanning circuitry discharges each anode into a charge       sensitive preamplifier.  The charge pulse is digitized and the       information added into a shift register memory consisting of       128 16-bit words.  The 128-anode array consists of two separate       interdigitated 64-anode arrays scanned by two shift registers.       The shift registers and memory are driven by a 200 kHz clock,       so that an individual anode is accessed every 320 microsecond.       The detector scan rate is therefore about 3125 Hz.         Wavelengths shorter than about 0.1250 micron strike the MCP       directly.  Longer wavelengths first pass through a MgF2 filter       with a semi-transparent photocathode of CuI.  This serves to       boost the quantum efficiency at long wavelengths and to reduce       the response to second-order light.         The detector is heavily shielded to reduce its response to       trapped particle radiation.  A description of the detector may       be found in [BROADFOOT&SANDEL1977].

Most of the electronics is in       the base of the instrument, but clock drive generators for the       anode array and the first stage of charge sensitive       preamplification of the analog signal processing electronics       are mounted in the detector housing so that they are near the       anode array.  Elements of the electronics complement include:              (1)  Low voltage power supply            (2)  High voltage power supply            (3)  Clock drive generator for the anode array            (4)  Analog signal processing electronics including A/D                 conversion            (5)  128x16 bit accumulation memory for spectrum            (6)  FDS interface         The FDS interface sends data to the FDS on demand and accepts       mode commands from the FDS.  The mode commands set the level of       the high voltage applied to the MCPs of the detector and set       the mode of analog signal processing (pulse counting or       integration).         Radiation-hard electronics components were used where possible,       and spot radiation shielding was used to reduce the fluence at       certain critical elements.         Instrument Optics 'UVS'     =======================       The optical system consists mainly of the mechanical collimator       and concave diffraction grating.  The 13 aperture plates of the       collimator establish a field of 0.1x0.87 degree for the airglow       field and 0.25x0.87 degree for the occultation field.  The 0.1       and 0.25 degree dimensions are in the dispersion direction, and       the 0.87 degree dimension is in the cross-dispersion direction.       The collimator provides separate light paths for the airglow       and occultation ports, and a small mirror diverts the       occultation field by 20 degrees from the airglow field.         The concave diffraction grating is a platinum coated replica,       ruled at 540 lines/mm, blazed at 0.0800 microns and having a       spherical radius of curvature of 400.1 mm.  Dispersion in the       image plane is 0.00926 microns/mm, or 0.000926 microns/channel.       The grating substrate is a 4x6-cm rectangle, and the useful       ruled area is 21 square cm.

In the pulse       counting mode, the number in the corresponding memory location       is incremented by one if a charge above a fixed threshold is       detected on an anode.  The access time of 320 microsec implies       that single random photoevents can be recorded on any one of       the anodes at a rate of about 300 Hz with a coincidence of 10%.       The pulse-counting mode is used for all measurements except       solar occultations.

In this case the charge on each       anode is coarsely digitized and added to the previously       accumulated signal in memory.  The statistics of sampling these       events is complicated by the logarithmic pulse height       distribution of the events.  There is also a logarithmic       current limit function of the MCPs at the high event rates that       normally obtain when this mode is used.  Because both these       characteristics lead to non-linear response, modeling of the       detector response is needed to restore linearity.  The       integration mode is used for observing solar occultations.

It is not intended to be a detailed technical description nor a complete operator's manual. For a detailed technical description, the reader is directed to papers in the open literature (Miller et al 1996, Reininger et al 1994).     VIMS-V is a multispectral imager covering the spectral range from 0.30 to 1.05 micrometers. VIMS-V is equipped with a frame transfer CCD matrix detector on which spatial and spectral information is simultaneously stored. The CCD is passively cooled in the range -20/+40 degrees C. Radiation collected from VIMS-V telescope is focused onto the spectrometer slit. The slit image is spectrally dispersed by a diffraction grating and then imaged on the CCD: thus, on each CCD column a monochromatic image of the slit is recorded. On-chip summing of pixels allows implementation of a large number of operating modes for different observing conditions.     The maximum capabilities of VIMS-V are a spectral resolution of 1.46 nm and a spatial resolution of .167 millirads while in the high-resolution mode of operation. On-chip summing of 5 spectral x 3 spatial pixels enables the normal mode of operation whereby VIMS-V achieves a spectral resolution of 7.3 nm and a spatial resolution of .5 millirads. The total field of view of the instrument is 2.4 deg x 2.4 deg, although matching with the IR channel imposes the use of a 1.8 deg x 1.8 deg FOV. In table 1 are listed the main characteristics of the instrument.     VIMS-V is composed of two modules, the optical head and the electronic assemblies, housed in separate boxes. The VIMS-V optical head consists of two units: a scanning telescope and a grating spectrometer, ideally joined at the telescope focal plane where the spectrometer entrance slit is located.  The telescope mirrors are mounted on an optical bench that also holds the spectrometer. In fact, the optical bench is the reference plane for the whole instrument.     The telescope primary mirror is mounted on a scan unit that accomplishes two specific tasks: a) pointing and b) scanning. The scanning capability enables the .5 millirads IFOV of the nominal mode of operation by a two-step motion of the primary mirror during each integration time; images are produced by scanning across the object target in the down track direction (push-broom technique). The pointing capability is used to image selected target regions in a range about 1.8 degrees around the optical axis, and to observe the Sun, through the solar port, during in-flight radiometric calibration.     An in-flight calibration unit is located at the entrance of the telescope.  The unit consists of: a) two LEDs for a two-point calibration of the spectral dispersion and b) a solar port for direct solar imaging and hence for radiometric calibration. Because the remote sensing pallet is body-mounted to the spacecraft, to image the Sun the spacecraft is reoriented to form a 20 deg angle with the boresight direction of the instrument and the instrument scan mirror needs to be moved to an angle of 4.8 degrees from boresight. Under these conditions light from the Sun passes through a cutout in the instrument baffle and then through a prism that attenuates the solar radiation and redirects it towards the telescope primary mirror. Due to budget constraints, the high-resolution mode was been implemented and tested, but not calibrated. Calibration will be accomplished during the cruise phase to Saturn.     The VIMS infrared channel is the culmination of an effort by the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in collaboration with the French and Italian space agencies to develop an improved imaging spectrometer for use in spacecraft studies of planetary surfaces and atmospheres. This collaboration resulted in several similar instruments optimized for different planetary targets, most notably the OMEGA instrument, the Mars Observer VIMS, and the CRAF VIMS. Mars Observer VIMS and CRAF VIMS are Cassini VIMS most immediate forebears, but changes made in the VIMS instrument design in response to NASA's demands to reduce the cost of the strawman Cassini VIMS resulted in a substantial heritage from Galileo NIMS. Despite that heritage, which goes so far as to include parts from the Galileo NIMS engineering model, Cassini VIMS is a substantial step beyond NIMS in the evolution of visual and infrared imaging spectrometers.     The major differences between the Cassini VIMS and the Galileo NIMS lie in the incorporation of a separate visual channel using a frame-transfer, silicon CCD detector with separate foreoptics and analog/control electronics, the inclusion of a radically improved infrared detector with improved order sorting and thermal background rejection, an improved infrared focal plane cooler design, an improved main electronics design, a two-dimensional, voice-coil-actuator-driven, scanning secondary mirror in the infrared foreoptics, a fixed, triply blazed grating in the infrared, a redundant 16 megabit buffer, and a redundant, lossless, hardware data compressor using a unique compression algorithm developed by Yves Langevin. These improvements result in an instrument with substantially greater capability for planetary imaging spectroscopy--so much so that Cassini VIMS is the most capable and complex imaging spectrometer presently flying on a NASA planetary spacecraft.     The IR channel optics that was successfully deployed as of August 15, 1999, some 50 hours before the time of closest approach during the Cassini Earth Swingby. The visual and IR channels are mounted to a palette that holds them in optical alignment and helps to thermally isolate the instrument from the Cassini spacecraft.  Thermal isolation is particularly important for the infrared channel because thermal background radiation from the IR spectrometer, combined with shot noise from leakage current in the InSb photodiodes of the 256 element linear array detector of the IR channel are the chief sources of noise in measurements obtained with the IR channel. The nominal operating temperature for the IR focal plane is 55-60 K and for the IR foreoptics and spectrometer optics 120 K.     The Cassini VIMS instrument is mounted on the Cassini spacecraft by means of a palette (called the Remote Sensing Palette or RSP) on which are also mounted the Cassini Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS), the Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS), and the Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (UVIS). Mounting of all the Cassini remote sensing instruments on a common palette allows relatively precise boresight alignment of the four instruments, enhancing synergy between the 4 instruments.     Science Objectives   ==================     The VIMS science investigation is focused on the study of the Saturn system and on objects that Cassini encountered during it's cruise to Saturn. The Cassini trajectory uses gravity assists from Venus, Earth and Jupiter to eventually get the Cassini spacecraft to Saturn, so additional opportunities for scientific study of planetary bodies present themselves well ahead of the Cassini Saturn orbital insertion maneuver.     The Saturn System provides a unique challenge for VIMS. VIMS's capability to acquire the full range of visual-near-infrared wavelengths in two-dimensional maps over a wide variety of illumination and emission angles enables a diverse investigation of chemical, dynamical, and geophysical phenomena. Important targets for VIMS include the surface and atmosphere of Titan, the cloud-rich atmosphere of Saturn, Saturn's rings, and a plethora of icy moons. Observations of both the day and night sides of these objects should lead to increased insights into various phenomena involving both reflection and emission of radiation.  Occultations of the Sun and stars by these objects should provide new insights into the nature of tenuous stratospheric hazes on Saturn and Titan, the structure of faint rings, and atmospheric composition.     Calibration Description   =======================     The main VIMS ground calibration took place at the Jet Propulsion Lab during the months of January and February 1996. The detailed plan for the VIMS ground calibration evolved over a period of approximately 4 years, being completed in mid 1995, roughly 6 months before the actual measurements were to commence. The time frame for the ground calibration was driven by the planned delivery date of the fully integrated VIMS instrument in the September-October period, 1996. Because the VIMS Visual Channel was not completed at the time of the main calibration, only the IR channel was calibrated. The Visual channel was calibrated separately at Officine Galileo (Firenze, Italy) (the instrument provider), in the spring of 1996, and later a small number of operational/performance tests were carried out in late summer of 1996 after the Visual and IR channels were integrated at JPL. As a result of the slip in the schedule for the delivery of the Visual Channel, a substantial recalibration of the instrument has been undertaken while the VIMS is in route to Saturn. The details of the efforts to calibrate the VIMS instrument in flight appear later in this document.     The main ground calibration of the IR channel was carried out in 6 separate areas: radiometric/flat field response, geometric, polarimetric, spectral, and solar port response. In the early phases of the genesis of the VIMS ground calibration plan, measurement of VIMS stray light rejection performance was also envisioned, but practical difficulties in performing those measurements under vacuum and at the operational temperatures required necessitated elimination the ground based measurements in favor of measurements in flight. Those measurements are discussed later in this document.     The actual measurements were carried out in the JPL thermal vacuum testing facility in the largest thermal vacuum tank available. The in-flight thermal environment for VIMS was simulated by cooling the interior surfaces of the thermal vacuum tank with liquid N2, and providing a cold target that filled the fields of view of both the visual and infrared channel's passive coolers with a high emissivity surface cooled to 4 K.  In retrospect, the thermal environment of the JPL thermal vacuum tank and the cold target was quite accurate because the temperatures of the instruments optics and focal planes in flight are within a few K of those measured while the instrument was in the test environment. Described in more detail below are the main results of Each of the major calibration tests listed above. For more information on the VIMS calibration during the galilean satellites flyby, see McCord et al 2004.     RADIOMETRIC CALIBRATION     VIMS IR Channel     The radiometric response of the VIMS IR channel was carried out before launch in the thermal vacuum facility at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. A team of scientists, supported by the instrument engineering team at JPL, designed and carried out these measurements. The team members responsible are Thomas B. McCord (lead), Robert Brown, Angioletta Coradini, Vittorio Formisano, and Ralf Jaumann. Also contributing were Giancarlo Bellucci, Bonnie Buratti, Frank Trauthan, Charles Hibbitts and Gary Hansen. Two sessions were conducted, one in January and the other in July of 1996.  In-flight calibration efforts were conducted during the Venus, Earth and Jupiter flybys and for two star observations.  A workshop was held in Hawaii in February 2001 to review the information obtained. Additional people contributing post launch were Kevin Baines, Roger Clark, and Robert Nelson. More information on the calibration test and data results can be found in Coradini et al 2004.     The equipment facility during the ground calibration included a JPL thermal vacuum chamber cooled by liquid nitrogen and containing the instrument, which viewed the outside through a window with known optical transmission.  A reflecting collimator fed light from several sources to the instrument.  The calibrated sources were a glow bar and a tungsten lamp and their energy delivered to the instrument was controlled by adjustable iris diaphragms at the exit of the lamps. The light sources and delivery system were covered to eliminate outside light and, during the first session, the tent was purged with dry nitrogen to reduce the effects of the atmosphere gas absorptions (mainly CO2 and H20). Measurements were made at several instrument and focal plane temperatures, but most measurements were made with the focal plane temperature in the range 60.7 to 61.69 K.  Data were acquired at several light levels and integration times, including zero.     The characteristics of the instrument that were explored were dark current (detector thermal carrier generation and electronic off-sets), background signal (mostly thermal radiation from the chamber window and from outside), linearity of response, ratio of responses at the two gain states, performance of the detector for two different bias levels, and overall radiometric response over the spectral range. The instrument was determined to be linear within the measurement error to detector saturation. The dark current, background, gain ratios and behavior at different bias are reasonable, stable and as expected. The overall spectral responsivity was most difficult to calibrate due to several factors, including an unexpected and unknown (at the time) change in a light source during the calibration effort. This effort has been enhanced during in-flight calibration efforts and the responsivity calibration seems to be converging.     In-flight calibrations were conducted at Venus only for the visual channel because the cooler cover was not yet removed from the IR channel radiator.  The entire instrument calibration was tested at the Earth-Moon (for the Moon only) and the Jupiter fly-bys and for two star observations. The data are still being analyzed at this writing for the in-flight calibrations, but the general result so far is to further refine the calibrations and to gain better understanding of the instrument performance, which remains as expected.     One interesting characteristic experienced is the difficulty of achieving precise and stable calibration for sources smaller than the spectrometer slit width (sub-pixel sources). This is because the effective spectral resolution of the spectrometer and the exact location of the source image on the detectors depend on the size of the source and its exact location in the focal plane. Thus, it will be difficult to precisely predict radiometric performance for sub-pixel sources. Nevertheless, for sources that fill the slit, the instrument behavior is normal and as expected. The spectro-radiometric response function as currently known is given in figure 6.1. Improvements and changes are expected with time and more analysis. Thus, the reader is referred to the VIMS Planetary Data System (PDS) archive for appropriate calibrations to be used with flight data.     VIMS Visual Channel     The VIMS visual channel was constructed and calibrated in Italy, at Officine Galileo (Firenze, Italy). The VIMS-V was has been calibrated in two phase: 1) at the Officine Galileo (Firenze, Italy) premises, prior to the integration with the infrared channel; 2) at JPL after the integration on the remote sensing palette.  The activity carried out at JPL was mainly devoted to geometric measurements; that is, co-alignment of the two channels and measurement of the relative radiometric response. Furthermore, the instrument spatial response (measurement of the image quality through the instrument Modulation Transfer Function and Point Spread Function) were evaluated as part of the Full Functional Tests performed at Officine Galileo (Firenze, Italy) prior to the calibration activity.     VIMS-V was placed inside a vacuum chamber equipped with a thermally stabilized radiator connected to the CCD and capable of keeping the CCD at a temperature in the range -20/+40 deg C under a residual pressure of lower than 10-4 mbar. The chamber has a window (TVC window) with transparency better than 0.9 throughout the entire spectral range. VIMS-V was mounted on two computer-controlled rotating tables for fine positioning around azimuthal and elevation angles. Two lamps were used to cover the full spectral range: a Xenon lamp for the range 0.3 - 0.4 microns, and a Tungsten lamp between 0.4 and 1.035 microns. The lamp with its housing, which includes a condenser and a diffusing screen to improve light uniformity, was positioned at the input slit of a Jobin-Yvon HR640 monochromator capable of better than 0.05 nm resolution (band width at half height) over the VIMS-V spectral range. The monochromator output was then used to illuminate a slit, pinhole or test targets (corresponding to a specific type of test) placed at the focus of an off-axis collimator. The collimated beam was fed to the instrument inside the vacuum chamber.  Unfortunately, the collimated beam has as unknown spectral irradiance; thus, we had to devise a method to measure it. This was achieved using a beam splitter, of known optical properties, placed in the optical path at 45 deg C in front of the chamber window. The reflected portion of the beam was collected by a calibrated photodiode to monitor the irradiance output of the light source set up. An additional calibrated photodiode was placed every 50 nm (or 50 monochrometor steps) directly in front of the collimator to have direct calibration at the collimator aperture.     With the available collimator only 1/6th of the full VIMS-V FOV could be instantaneously illuminated, thus a time consuming procedure was implemented to repeat a full spectral sweep (0.3 to 1.05 microns in 1 nm steps) to cover the field of view of the instrument.  The radiometric calibration of VIMS-V was as follows. The Unit Response of the instrument is defined as the output in Digital Numbers when the instrument entrance pupil is fed with a light beam of 1 W per square cm, and this beam is collected entirely into a single spectel and into a unit solid angle, for an integration time of 1 s. This quantity was directly measured along with its dependence on wavelength. The spectral calibration was performed in order to evaluate the spectrally weighted center of each channel as well as the spectral width. The spectral width of each Spectel is of 5 times 1.46 nm = 7.33 nm.  For a detailed discussion on the calibration see Capaccioni et al. (1998).     We note that the radiometric transfer function obtained at OG during on ground calibration of VIMS-V when applied to the Moon and Venus illuminated side is insufficient to remove instrumental effects. Moreover two problems are apparent: a shift in wavelengths of about two nominal pixels and an inadequate removal of instrumental effects, particularly at short wavelengths. So we measured a new unit response function using the Venus and Moon data in the following way.     We use an Apollo 16 landing site telescopic reflectance spectrum (McCord and Adams, 1973) on a bright area on the Moon surface. This choice is supported by the fact that Apollo 16 landing site is on the lunar highlands where the albedo is particularly high.     GEOMETRIC CALIBRATION     For VIMS, the primary data product is, for each resolved pixel of a given target, the determination of both the pixel position and the full spectrum from 0.35 to 5.2 microns. To build such spectral images, for each picture element of any given 64 x 64 frame, the viewing direction of each of its 352 contiguous spectral elements (spectels) must be known. Thus, the prime goal of the geometric calibration of VIMS was to determine the relative viewing directions of all 96 VIMS-V and 256 VIMS-IR spectels within the full VIMS Field of View (FOV), in a frame to be referenced to the Cassini spacecraft.     A complexity originates from the basic difference in the way the spectral images are obtained by the two channels: VIMS-V operates in a push-broom mode, acquiring an entire cross-track line simultaneously spread over its spectral dimension (from 0.35 to 1.0 microns) along the second dimension of its CCD detector. The second spatial dimension is acquired either using the S/C drift or the scanning of the VIMS-V telescope secondary mirror.  VIMS-IR uses only a linear array detector, thus it acquires one pixel only spread over its spectral dimension (from 0.85 to 5.2 microns). The cross-track spatial dimension is acquired by scanning the telescope secondary mirror (whiskbroom mode), while the along track dimension is acquired (as for VIMS-V) using either spacecraft drift or scanning the IR telescope's secondary mirror in two dimensions. With two distinct scanning mechanisms, telescopes, and spectrometers, the boresight alignment and the Instantaneous Fields Of View (IFOV) within the full FOV are not identical by design, and in principle, wavelength dependent. The geometric calibration is thus intimately coupled to the determination of these spectral registration effects.     Due to the late delivery of VIMS-V, the ground geometric calibration was performed in steps: the in-depth geometric calibration of VIMS-IR was performed first, prior to the integration with VIMS-V, followed by the geometric calibration of VIMS-V after its integration. After integration, a large misalignment was observed, requiring a global mechanical realignment of both the IR and V channels (out of the calibration chamber), followed by a few final control measurements (back to the calibration chamber) prior to integration with the Cassini spacecraft.  Some in-flight calibrations were performed to assess the actual geometrical characteristics of both channels, when the instrument had reached its proper in-flight thermal regime, late during the cruise towards Jupiter.     During the ground calibration, VIMS was mounted on a fixed platform, thermally controlled and under vacuum. A collimator and optical bench assembly was constructed outside of the thermal-vacuum chamber, and viewed through a large window. For the geometric calibration, we chose to image with VIMS, two types of targets, both mounted on an X-Y stage to allow coverage of the entire VIMS FOV. In the target projector plane, one VIMS pixel (0.5 mrad) corresponded to ~ 1 mm. To cover the entire VIMS FOV, the target was 64 mm in size, and the stage was moved by steps of 0.1 mm (1/10 VIMS pixels). The first type of target consisted of linear blades to measure potential spectral registration effects by analyzing for each spectel the pixel response while the blade was moved across the pixel. The other target placed in the projector focal plane consisted of an opaque metallic target with a grid of sub-pixel sized pinholes (0.1 mm in diameter) evenly spaced, and back-illuminated by a tungsten lamp. The complete calibration data products are in the form of tables, one for each spectral channel, giving the viewing direction of each VIMS pixel. Below we summarize some of the main results.     The IFOVs of both channels were very accurately measured. Averaged over all wavelengths within a given channel, IFOVIR = 0.495 +/- 0.003 mrad, and IFOVVIS = 0.506 +/- 0.003 mrad. Although the differences look small (~ 2 %), they result in a relative VIMS-VIS/VIMS-IR misalignment over the entire 64-pixel FOV that is larger than one pixel, requiring a thorough geometric re-sampling of all image cubes larger than 32 pixels. Prior to launch, the last geometric measurement showed a boresight alignment between VIMS-V and VIMS-IR of better than 0.3 pixels at all wavelengths.  Images coincide independent of wavelength to within < 0.5 pixel in frames up to 12 x 12 pixels.     The first measurements in flight were performed using both channels to observe the Moon during the Cassini Earth-Moon fly-by (08/18/1999). Those showed a boresight misalignment of VIMS-IR with respect to VIMS-V (-1 pixels, +2 pixels). Because the VIMS-IR had not reached its nominal thermal regime during the Earth-Moon flyby, it was concluded that at least part of misalignment was the result of thermal gradients in the IR channel that would lessen as the Cassini spacecraft moved farther from the Sun and the IR channel cooled. A recent calibration using the Pleiades cluster and the star Fomalhaut (late March, 2001) showed boresight offsets of (-1,0) pixels. The Pleiades observation shows the misalignment variation within the FOV, as illustrated in Figure 8 showing the various stars in the visual (blue pixels, averaged over the first 30 VIS spectels) and the near IR (red pixels, averaged over the first 40 spectels).     The ground calibration yielded for most IR spectels, the VIMS FOV, leading to spectral geometric 'distortion' maps. For images up to 32 x 32 pixels, all spectral images coincide to better than 1/3 pixel Larger discrepancies appear in the bottom right and top left corners of the frame, where spectral misalignments up to half a pixel are present. This is illustrated in the Figure 9, scaled in mrad, for three IR wavelengths (spectels 103, 150 and 206, at 0.98 microns, 1.75 and 2.68 microns, in red, blue and green respectively), enlarging the four corners and the center of the FOV geometric spectral responses.     Finally, the spectral registration effects measured for the IR spectels were demonstrated very low, as illustrated in the figure: the huge sensitivity of the measurements allow detection of effects at a scale smaller than 1/10 pixel. With this resolution, the larger effects we see between contiguous spectels actually amount for 1/10 px, and in fact result from atmospheric contributions during the calibration (variation of H2O and CO2 features). The only large-scale effect present (black curve) has a very low frequency (at the scale of the entire spectral range), and likely results from optical aberrations within the IR spectrometer. It is both smooth and small enough to minimize the risk of misinterpreting potential large optical contrasts in the observed scene in terms of false spectral signatures.     SPECTRAL CALIBRATION     The goals of the spectral calibration of VIMS were to measure the spectral response of each VIMS spectral channel to determine the central wavelength and spectral profile of each detector, and its spectral stability as a function of temperature and spatial position within the field of view of the instrument. To achieve this, the tests included: 1) scanning a nearly monochromatic line (using a calibrated grating monochrometer) over the VIMS wavelength range to map the spectral profile of each VIMS detector, 2) transmission spectra of materials with sharp absorption bands, and 3) measuring reflectance spectra of minerals and other targets with VIMS.     The monochrometer scans were useful for a single position in the full VIMS field of view because the relatively large field of view of the VIMS could not be covered with the narrow exit slit of the monochrometer, and small shifts in wavelength were observed in the monochrometer as a function of distance along the slit. This results because a change in direction along the slit results in a slight change in the field position in VIMS that corresponds to an angular movement. Such changes require a change in the light path through the monochrometer with a corresponding change in the effect output wavelength of the monochrometer. Thus the monochrometer tests were done on axis only.  The monochrometer was typically scanned at 1 nm increments to map out the profile of each VIMS spectral bandpass.     Calibrated transmission filters consisting of a mylar sheet displaying sharp absorption bands in the 1-3.5 micron region, with broader features at longer wavelengths, and Corning glass filters containing rare-earth elements which give sharp absorption features in the visual and near-infrared wavelength regions, and broader absorptions at longer wavelengths were used to cover the full VIMS field of view. Because of their uniformity and stability, the filters were used to determine the stability of the VIMS wavelength response as a function of spatial position, temperature, and time (because two tests were done over a period of about 6 months).     To measure VIMS response to real targets with spectral features, a set of minerals and other materials were assembled into a spectral target and measured in reflectance. Because the calibration geometry was optimized for other tests, the setup for reflectance measurements was not ideal, so these tests are more qualitative. The light source used to illuminate the samples was set up at relatively large angles to the normal to the surface of the highly scattering surface of the spectral target, the exact viewing geometry is difficult to assess. Furthermore, only vertical samples could be measured, so it was not possible to measure the reflectance of unconstrained, loose particulate samples. Measurements were made of rocks and solid samples that typically had large grains, thus the absorption bands were deep and saturated, but the spectra of these rocks are quite identifiable with the VIMS.     The spectral calibration tests showed that VIMS is a remarkable instrument, producing spectra comparable in quality to specialized laboratory spectrometers. The large spectral range of the VIMS, ~0.2 to 5.1 microns includes the region of increasing thermal emission at room temperature making the light reflected from the sample difficult to separate from the background thermal emission. The spectral range of VIMS is greater than the spectral output any single convenient laboratory light source, so tests were often done multiple times with different light sources.     Spectral calibration of VIMS occurred in three separate steps. The Visual channel was calibrated separately in Italy prior to integration with the IR channel at JPL. The IR channel was calibrated in the thermal vacuum tests at JPL January 28 to February 5, 1996. The integrated instrument was further tested at the JPL thermal vacuum facility July 16-17, 1996. This final test was limited and only included filter transmission and mineral target tests.     The spectral calibration resulted in a specification of the wavelength position and bandpass of each VIMS spectral channel across the instrument field of view and as a function of temperature. The VIMS-IR spectral response is identical across the full field of view to within about a nanometer (nm) over the temperature range tested.  The VIMS-IR sampling interval is about 16 nm in the IR, thus a 1-nm shift is a small fraction is < 7% of the sampling interval. The VIMS-V has a sampling interval of ~7 nm and tests show stability to better than about 0.3 nm.     POLARIMETRIC CALIBRATION     The VIMS instrument contains no specific polarimetric capability, such as filters or grids, but the design of the grating spectrometer makes it inevitable that the instrument's response will be linearly polarized to some extent. The purpose of the polarimetric calibrations was to characterize this sensitivity, so that its effect on the accuracy of spectra obtained for both polarized and non-polarized targets in the Saturn system can be assessed. In general, spacecraft pointing constraints will determine the roll attitude of the ORS instruments during targeted observations, leaving little opportunity for observations at multiple roll orientations.     Measurements for the polarization characterization of the VIMS IR channel were carried out in the 10 ft thermal-vacuum tank in Bldg 144 at JPL, during Jan 17-20, 1996.  A target projector was set up with a 26 mm diameter IR linear polarizing filter at the focal plane of a collimator. The target was illuminated by the 1-inch output aperture of an integrating sphere, producing a polarized image of the exit aperture of the sphere at the VIMS focal plane. The polarizer consisted of a ZnSe substrate with a deposited aluminum wire grid, and its polarization efficiency is documented from 2.5 microns to beyond 10 microns.  The average single-polarizer throughput is 38%, while the maximum cross-polarized throughput over the 2.5- to 5.0 microns range is 1.5%. No data on the filter transmission were available below 2.5 microns. A calibrated tungsten source with a Teflon-coated sphere provided adequate SNR out to about 2.5 microns, while a glowbar source with a gold integrating sphere provided adequate SNR at all wavelengths beyond 1.5 midrons.     Measurements were made at 5 spatial positions of the source in the target p",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Taken together these components can detect and digitize wave electric             fields from 50 Hz to 45.25 MHz and wave magnetic fields from 50 Hz to 20             kHz.  At the highest duty cycle, Waves can record one sweep per second             across all spectral bands while simultaneously capturing 5 waveforms in             various bands.                          Electric fields are detected via an electric dipole antenna deployed from             the aft flight deck in a 'V' configuration with a tip-tip length of about 4             meters.  The signal from the electric antenna is conditioned in the electric             preamplifier which has three frequency bands and each band has an attenuator             that can be selected or not, to limit the input to the receivers under              strong signal conditions.  When enabled attenuations are 25.3 dB, 25.3 dB,              and 19.0 dB for the 50 Hz - 20 kHz, 10 kHz - 150 kHz and 100 kHz - 45 MHz             bands respectively.  Wave magnetic components, are detected via a magnetic             search coil which is also mounted to the aft flight deck.  The signals from             the search coil are conditioned by a magnetic preamplifier located close to             the sensor, but within the spacecraft thermal environment.                          The instrument includes three receivers to detect signals from the sensors.             The first is a 3-channel low frequency receiver (LFR) that is used to             analyze plasma waves.  Two channels measure electric fields in the frequency             ranges of 50 Hz to 20 kHz and 10 to 150 kHz, and one channel measures             magnetic fields in the range of 50 Hz to 20 kHz.  The electric channels             include an attenuator that may be toggled either on or off by the automatic             gain control software in the data processing unit.  When on signals are             attenuated by 19.8 dB (low-band) and 19.4 dB (high-band) in addition to any             attenuation by the electric preamp.  All 3 LFR channels are sampled             simultaneously.  This receiver produces a digitized waveform from each             channel which is either sent directly to the ground (after compression) in             burst mode or spectrum analyzed in the Waves digital signal processor to             produce spectra with ~ 10 logarithmically-spaced channels per decade of             frequency.                          The LFR also has a noise input from the spacecraft power distribution unit             (PDDU).  By subtracting this noise channel from the channel from either             antenna, a noise cancellation process can be carried out. Based on in-flight             experience, there is insufficient spacecraft noise as determined from the             line from the PDDU to merit this additional processing; this will be             re-evaluated at Jupiter.                          Waves also contains two nearly identical high frequency receivers, HFR-44             and HFR-45.  (The numeric suffix is just a tracking ID and bares no             relationship to frequency.)  Each receiver contains three channels.  A             baseband channel, which handles measurements in the 0.1 to 3 MHz band, a             down-mixed log response channel for sweep frequency operations in the 3 MHz             to 41 MHz range, and a paired-mixer channel covering the 3 MHz to 45.25 MHz             range for acquiring high frequency resolution spectra near the electron             cyclotron frequency.  To provide additional support for handling large             amplitude signals, each HFR has a front-end 32 dB step-attenuator that may             be set to add further attenuation to incoming signals, in 2 dB steps.  The             operation of the step-attenuators is handled automatically by the Waves             digital signal processing unit.                          The HFR baseband channel operates much as the LFR, though waveforms are             digitized at the much higher rate of 7 Msps.  Like the LFR, HFR baseband             samples may be sent out 'as-is' (with compression) in burst mode or sent to             the digital signal processor for conversion to spectra in survey made.                          The HFR down-mixed log response channel operates quite differently.             Incoming signals are mixed with a locally generated pure sine wave.  The             result is then low-pass filtered below 500 kHz.  Due to the low pass filter,             only frequency components within 500 kHz of the of local mixer frequency             contribute to the output signal power.  This down-mixed signal is directed             to a log-amplifier which produces an output voltage proportional to the             logarithm of the energy in the band, which is then digitized at 8-bit             resolution.  Measurements are taken as in a classic swept frequency             receiver.  The mixer signal is set to 3.5 MHz and then incremented in 1 MHz             steps ending at 40.5 MHz, thus producing successive measurements of spectral             density in 1 MHz bands from 3 MHz to 41 MHz.  This channel is used              exclusively for generating survey mode data.                          The HFR paired-mixer channel shares components with the log response channel             but feeds incoming signals to two frequency mixers instead of just one.             Both mixers are set to the same mixing frequency, but for one mixer, the             local tone is 90 degrees out of phase with the other.  As with the log             response channel, the mixer output is low-pass filtered below 500 kHz and              the two resulting down-mixed signals are digitized at 1.3125 MHz and             transmitted to the ground for further processing into high resolution 1 MHz             bandwidth spectra, details of the processing steps are outlined in Appendix             C of VOLSIS.HTM.  The purpose for collecting high resolution measurements             far above the baseband is to examine detailed structure near the electron             cyclotron frequency, so instead of merely sweeping the receiver across all             bands in a regular cadence, the mixer tone is either commanded to a             particular frequency or set to automatically track Fce using measurements             provided by the MAG instrument on-board.  The mixer frequency can be set             between 3.5 and 44.75 MHz in 0.25 MHz steps, which allows for 1 MHz spectra             covering the range of 3 MHz to 45.25 MHz.  In cases where Fce drops below             3 MHz the HFR baseband channel is used for data collection and the mixers             are disabled.                            The Waves digital signal processing unit is implemented in a field-             programmable gate array.  This unit handles all measurement scheduling,             automatically controls receiver attenuators, provides facilities for             converting digitized waveforms to spectra, provides loss-less Rice             compression, and handles communications with the Juno spacecraft command             and data system.

urn:nasa:pds:context:instrument:xrs.mess,X-Ray Spectrometer for MESSENGER,X-Ray Spectrometer,"The X-Ray Spectrometer (XRS) experiment was comprised of three identical gas proportional counters (GPC) that measure X-rays emitted from the surface of Mercury in the energy range from about 1 to 10 keV. X-rays in this energy range sample the planetary surface to depths of a few tens of microns. The GPCs each had a 10-cm2 active area and used both anti-coincidence wires and pulse shape discrimination to minimize background. Balanced filters were used to resolve the lower energy X-ray lines from Mg, Al, and Si. This technique was used previously on other orbital X-ray experiments flown on the Apollo 15, 16 and NEAR-Shoemaker missions. One GPC had a thin aluminum filter, which filtered out Si photons, one had a thin Mg filter, which filtered out Al and Si photons, and the third GPC had no filter. The energy resolution of the gas counters was sufficient to resolve higher energy lines from S, Ca, Ti, and Fe. A small Si-PIN detector was used as a solar monitor, because the Sun is the source of the planetary X-ray fluorescence.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
