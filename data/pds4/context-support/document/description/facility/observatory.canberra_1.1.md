            The NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) comprises three Deep Space Communications Complexes (DSCCs)
            spaced by approximately 120 degrees in longitude and within about 40 degrees latitude
            of Earth's equator. As the Earth rotates, this configuration provides nearly continuous 
            coverage of spacecraft in the ecliptic -- that is, spacecraft flying to or orbiting most 
            solar system objects.  The Canberra Deep Space Communications Complex (CDSCC) is one of 
            these three DSCCs.  The first antenna at the complex (DSS-42) became operational in 1964.  
            The CDSCC is managed by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation.
            
            The CDSCC includes several Deep Space Stations (DSSs, or antennas), a Signal Processing
            Center (SPC), and administrative and support facilities.  Each DSCC handles several types of 
            data including: frequency and timing, tracking, telemetry, command, monitor, radio science, 
            and very long baseline interferometry. These data types support uplink (to spacecraft) or 
            downlink (from spacecraft) operations or passive reception.  Data received from spacecraft
            are relayed via the local SPC to the Network Operations Control Center (NOCC) at JPL where
            where they are distributed to the offices responsible for each spacecraft.  Commands, 
            generated in those offices, are sent via the NOCC, SPC, and DSS to the spacecraft.
