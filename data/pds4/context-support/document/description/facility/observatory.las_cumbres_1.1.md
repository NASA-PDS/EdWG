            The Las Cumbres Observatory comprises a global network of telescopes of
            various sizes (currently 0.4m, 1m, and 2m) and at various locations. Telescopes
            of the same aperture are identical and are equipped with the same detectors. 
            Scheduled observations are allocated to telescopes in the network based on 
            requested instrumentation and optimal observing circumstances as determined by
            the network scheduling software. Data documentation must be consulted to 
            determine which  telescope was used to make any specific observation with the 
            Las Cumbres network.
