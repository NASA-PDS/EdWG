          The NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) is one of the telescopes comprising the Maunakea Observatories on the Big Island of Hawaiâ€™i. The IRTF is a 3.2 meter telescope optimized for infrared observations. The observatory is operated and managed for NASA by the University of Hawai`i Institute for Astronomy, located in Honolulu. NASA provides the costs of operation and NSF provides funding for new focal plane instrumentation through the peer review process. Observing time is open to the entire astronomical community, and 50% of the IRTF observing time is reserved for studies of solar system objects.
