            Environmental laboratory, operated by University of California, Berkeley, consisting of laboratory buildings, and natural
            marshland located on San Francisco Bay. This facility serves as an off-site training facilitly for large-scale engineering
            projects. With more than 500,000 assignable square feet of research space, the site houses the eleven floor, 7.4 million
            volume storage capacity Northern Regional Library Facility, serving as an archive for lesser used books for four northern UC
            campuses. The Richmond Field Station also serves as one of the worldâ€™s largest earthquake shaking tables, sophisticated test 
            facilities for advanced transportation research, and a regional laboratory for U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
            
            The open areas of the Field Station are also prized for their research and habitat value. The site contains one of the largest 
            and best preserved remaining areas of native coastal grasslands that were once prevalent throughout the Bay Area. The adjacent 
            stands of eucalyptus provide a home for wintering monarch butterflies and nesting raptors. The bay marsh and mudflats provide 
            additional habitat for a variety of flora and fauna, including the endangered California Clapper Rail, as well as an opportunity 
            for the Berkeley campus to use these areas for teaching and research.
