            The Kleberg Advanced Microscopy Center (KAMC) at the University of Texas at San Antonio is an open access facility that provides
            state-of-the-art technology in electron microscopy and advanced material characterization to support world-class research in
            nanotechnology, biology, chemistry, and materials sciences. The Center features world-class instrumentation, including Helenita
            - the first aberration-corrected electron microscope installed in the United States that can see and chemically identify individual
            atoms, a Focused Ion Beam (FIB) instrument for TEM sample preparation, and 3-D imaging and chemical mapping via serial slicing and
            various SEMs. KAMC also supports analytical studies and characterization of nanoscale systems via high-resolution, multi-functional
            X-ray diffraction Spectroscopy (Panalytical Empyrean), Raman Spectroscopy, as well as Atomic Force Microscopes.
