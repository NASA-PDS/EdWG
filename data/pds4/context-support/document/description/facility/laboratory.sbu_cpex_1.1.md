            The  Center for Planetary Exploration at Stony Brook University and its constituent labs offer a 
            range of geochemical and spectroscopic characterization capabilities and data analysis facilities 
            of interest to the planetary science community. These include sample preparation for multiple 
            types of mineral and rock spectroscopy, a planetary geochemistry lab including X-ray fluorescence 
            and Inductively-Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometer; a Vibrational Spectroscopy Laboratory 
            with mid-infrared emissivity, reflectance, and microscopy capability, visible to near infrared 
            reflectance capability, and confocal Raman microscopy; and an Earth and Planetary Remote Sensing 
            Lab with field equipment and computing resources. Contact information as of this document time of 
            publication: Joel Hurowitz (joel.hurowitz@stonybrook.edu) for information regarding geochemical 
            characterization of samples, Timothy Glotch (timothy.glotch@stonybrook.edu) or Deanne Rogers 
            (Deanne.rogers@stonybrook.edu) for information regarding infrared or Raman spectroscopic 
            characterization.
