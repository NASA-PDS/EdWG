            The NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) comprises three Deep Space Communications Complexes (DSCCs)
            spaced by approximately 120 degrees in longitude and within about 40 degrees latitude
            of Earth's equator. As the Earth rotates, this configuration provides nearly continuous 
            coverage of spacecraft in the ecliptic -- that is, spacecraft flying to or orbiting most 
            solar system objects.  The Madrid Deep Space Communications Complex (MDSCC) is one of 
            these three DSCCs.  The first antennas at the complex became operational in the mid-1960s. 
            
            The MDSCC includes several Deep Space Stations (DSSs, or antennas), a Signal Processing
            Center (SPC), and administrative and support facilities.  Each DSCC handles several types of 
            data including: frequency and timing, tracking, telemetry, command, monitor, radio science, 
            and very long baseline interferometry. These data types support uplink (to spacecraft) or 
            downlink (from spacecraft) operations or passive reception.  Data received from spacecraft
            are relayed via the local SPC to the Network Operations Control Center (NOCC) at the NASA
            Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, CA, where they are distributed to the offices
            responsible for each spacecraft.  Commands, generated in those offices, are sent via the 
            NOCC, SPC, and DSS to the spacecraft.
            
            The Madrid Deep Space Communications Complex (MDSCC) is located about 65 km west of Madrid,
            near the town of Robledo de Chevala, Spain.  Under an agreement between the governments of
            Spain and the United States, dated 1964-01-29, the National Institute for Aerospace 
            Technology (INTA) and the U.S. space agency NASA signed a contract for operation and 
            maintenance of the MDSCC facilities. The creation, in 1992, of the state-owned Aerospace 
            Engineering and Services, SA (INSA, S.A.) under INTA, allowed the concentration of these 
            responsibilities in the new company. INSA has disappeared and Ingeniería de Sistemas para la
            Defensa de España is the company that has managed MDSCC since December 2012.
