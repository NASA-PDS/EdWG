            The Gemini Observatory consists of twin 8.1-meter diameter optical/infrared telescopes located on two of the best 
            observing sites on the planet. From their locations on mountains in Hawai'i and Chile, Gemini Observatory's telescopes 
            can collectively access the entire sky.
            
            Gemini is operated by a partnership of six countries including the United States, Canada, Chile, Brazil, Argentina and 
            Korea. Any astronomer in these countries can apply for time on Gemini, which is allocated in proportion to each partner's 
            financial stake.
            
            The Gemini South telescope is situated near the summit of Cerro Pachon in central Chile, at an altitude of 2722 m, at 
            latitude -30:14:26.700 and longitude -70:44:12.096 in the WGS84 system.
