          The Aarhus University Mars Simulation Laboratory is located in the Department of Geoscience at 
          Aarhus University in Aarhus, Denmark and is managed by Dr. Ralf MÃ¼ller and Dr. Jonathon Merrison.
          The Mars Simulation Laboratory is an interdisciplinary research collaboration of biologists, chemists, 
          geologists and physicists who work together on joint research related to the planet Mars. The group has 
          built its own research facilities and has access to all necessary facilities under the Faculty of Science 
          and Technology. Furthermore, some group members have developed instruments for Mars missions.
          
          The Laboratory has access to unique facilities including: two recirculating wind tunnels capable of working 
          over long time under low pressure conditions, two one-bar wind tunnels for sand transport, a microbiology 
          experimental Mars condition chamber, and suitable Mars analogue dust and soil materials. 
          In connection with research projects, the group also develops wind and dust sensing instruments.
