           This fully steerable telescope is a research and development radio/radar antenna that
           is part of the NASA Deep Space Network.  It was first operational in 1962 with a 26-m
           aperture and was named "Venus Station" to commemorate the first radar detection of Venus
           by radar facilities at Goldstone in 1961; the 26-m antenna was decommissioned in 1991.
           A 34-m beam waveguide (BWG) antenna was completed that year to facilitate development work
           at higher frequencies. DSS-13 has been used occasionally in conjunction with the Goldstone
           Solar System Radar for radar interferometry. Antenna coordinates were converted from 
           Table 5 in module 301 (revision L) of the DSN Telecommunications Link Design Handbook 
           (DSN document 810-005) and apply to the 34-m BWG antenna as used since 1991.
