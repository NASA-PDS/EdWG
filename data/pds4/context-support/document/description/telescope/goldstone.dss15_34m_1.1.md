           This fully steerable telescope iss a dual-shaped reflector radio antenna that was part of the 
           NASA Deep Space Network. It was part of the Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex (GDSCC)
           near Barstow, California (USA).  DSS 15 was first operational in the mid-1980s with a 34-m aperture;
           it was decommissioned in May 2018.  When operational, the antenna could receive at frequencies
           in the range 2.0-8.6 GHz in right- or left-circular polarization (but not simultaneously).
           It could transmit 50-250 W at 2.1 GHz or up to 20 kW at 7.1 GHz. Antenna coordinates were 
           converted from Table 5 in module 301 (revision L) of the DSN Telecommunications Link Design 
           Handbook (DSN document 810-005). DSS-15 was sometimes known as "Uranus Station".
           GDSCC is managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, CA.
