            Deep Space Station 42 (DSS-42) was the first antenna built at the Tidbinbilla tracking 
            station site near Canberra, Australia.  It entered service in mid 1964 and was designed
            to last 15 years.  Its first deep space mission support was for NASA's Mariner 4 
            spacecraft on its historic first flyby of Mars. Along with other dishes in the Deep 
            Space Network (DSN), it returned the first close up images of the surface of Mars.
            
            DSS-42 was originally constructed as a 26-m diameter antenna. To extend its life and 
            increase its capabilities, the dish was extended to 34-m in the early 1980s.  
            
            The Canberra Deep Space Communications Complex (CDSCC) is managed by the Commonwealth 
            Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), Australia's national science 
            research agency. The CDSCC is at Tidbinbilla, about 35 km southwest of Canberra, ACT.
