            Deep Space Station 61 (DSS-61) is located at the Madrid Deep Space Communications Complex near
            Madrid, Spain.  It became part of the NASA Deep Space Network in the mid 1960s.  Its original

            The Madrid Deep Space Communications Complex (MDSCC) is located about 65 km west of Madrid,
            near the town of Robledo de Chevala, Spain.  Under an agreement between the governments of Spain
            and the United States, dated 1964-01-29, the National Institute for Aerospace 
            Technology (INTA) and the U.S. space agency NASA signed a contract for operation and 
            maintenance of the MDSCC facilities.
