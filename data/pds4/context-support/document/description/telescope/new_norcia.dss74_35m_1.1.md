           DSS-74 is an ad hoc identifier for the ESA 35-m telescope near New Norcia, Australia, assigned by the
           JPL Radar and Radio Science Systems Group.  The telescope was constructed between 2000 and 2002;
           it began routine operations in March 2003.  The station can transmit up to 20 kW at 2 and 7 GHz; it can
           receive at 2 and 8 GHz.  Upgrades for operation in the 30 GHz range are planned.  The ESA designation 
           for the telescope is DSA-1; it is also known as NNO.  It was followed by Cebreros (DSA-2) and Malarguee 
           (DSA-3; DSS-84).
