            This 26-meter (85-ft.) diameter antenna was originally designed as part of the Manned Space Flight 
            Network (MSFN), managed by Goddard Space Flight Center. At the completion of the Apollo missions,
            DSS-16 was designated a part of the Satellite Tracking and Data Network (STDN) and used 
            for tracking Earth orbiting satellites and for initial acquisition of any spacecraft immediately 
            after launch. It partnered with DSS-46 (near Canberra, Australia) and DSS-66 (near Madrid, Spain)
            in a 26-m subnet for this purpose.  In the 1990s it provided communications with NASA's Space 
            Shuttle.  DSS-16 could transmit 50-2000 W at 2.1 GHz (S-band).  It could receive right- and 
            left-circularly polarized signals simultaneously at both 2.3 GHz and 8.4 GHz; its receiver could
            combine the signals to obtain a rotatable linear polization. The antenna was completed in 1966 
            and remained part of NASA's tracking networks until the mid-2000s.
