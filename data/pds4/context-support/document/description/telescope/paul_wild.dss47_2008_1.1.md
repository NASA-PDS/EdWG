            The ATCA is an array of six 22 m diameter antennas of Cassegrain design.  The collecting 
            area is equivalent to a single dish of diameter 54 m.  The array has a 
            3 km east-west track with a 214 m northern spur. Five antennas can be moved along these 
            tracks, with the sixth antenna at a fixed position 3 km to the west of the east-west track.  
            The longest possible baseline is, therefore, 6 km. The array can be used for observations 
            in five wavelength bands between 27 cm and (with five antennas only) 3 mm -- frequencies 
            between 1.1 GHz and 105 GHz.  Orthogonal polarizations (linear or circular) can be 
            observed simultaneously.
