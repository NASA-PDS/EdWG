           DSS-84 is an ad hoc identifier for the ESA 35-m telescope near Malarguee, Argentina, assigned by the
           Radar and Radio Science Systems Group at JPL.  The telescope is a Cassegrain beam waveguide (BWG) 
           antenna constructed between 2009 and 2012; it was inaugurated in December 2012 and began routine 
           service in early 2013.  The telescope has dichroic mirrors to separate X- and Ka-band signals; it 
           transmits up to 20 kW at 7 GHz and receives at 8 GHz 32 GHz using helium-cooled low-noise amplifiers.
           The ESA designation for the telescope is DSA-3, following New Norcia (DSA-1; DSS-74) and Cebreros (DSA-2).
