            Deep Space Station 36 (DSS-36) was built from 2012 to 2016, as part of the Deep Space Network's 
            Aperture Enhancement Program (DAEP), coming into service on 2016-10-01. It was 
            officially opened on 2016-11-03.  The antenna is very similar in structure to DSS-45; 
            however, the transmission and reception equipment is located underground rather than in a cone 
            at the focal point of the dish. The radio signal is guided from the subreflector through a hole
            in the surface of the dish to the receiving equipment via a system of reflecting mirrors inside
            a large tube. The reverse path allows transmission.  This design is called 'beam waveguide' (BWG);
            it reduces weight on the reflecting surface, insulates electronics from environmental factors 
            including dish movement, and simplifies maintenance. DSS-36 can transmit up to 250 W at 2.1 GHz
            and 20 kW at 7.1 GHz.  It can receive right- or  left-circular polarization at 2.2 GHz; in late
            2021 it will have the same capability at 26.2 GHz.  At 8.4 and 32.0 GHz it can receive both 
            polarizations simultaneously.  Antenna coordinates were converted from Table 5 in module
            301 (revision L) of the DSN Telecommunications Link Design Handbook (DSN document 810-005). 
            
            The Canberra Deep Space Communications Complex (CDSCC) is managed by the Commonwealth 
            Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), Australia's national science 
            research agency. The CDSCC is at Tidbinbilla, about 35 km southwest of Canberra, ACT.
