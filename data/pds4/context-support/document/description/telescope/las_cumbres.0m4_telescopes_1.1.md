            The 40cm telescopes of the Las Cumbres global network are built to be identical. They are
            Meade 16-inch (40cm), 3-element optics telescopes mounted in LCO equatorial C-ring mountings.
            Users should consult the data product documentation to determine which telescope was used to 
            record any specific observation when that information is needed.
