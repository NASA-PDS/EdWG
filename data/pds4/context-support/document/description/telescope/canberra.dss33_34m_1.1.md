            Deep Space Station 33 (DSS-33) is expected to become operational in 2026. The antenna will
            used the beam waveguide (BWG) design in which transmission and reception equipment is 
            located underground rather than in a cone at the focal point of the dish. The radio signal 
            is guided from the subreflector through a hole in the surface of the dish to the receiving 
            equipment via a system of reflecting mirrors inside a large tube. The reverse path allows 
            transmission.  This design reduces weight on the reflecting surface, insulates electronics 
            from environmental factors including dish movement, and simplifies maintenance. DSS-33 will 
            be able to transmit at 20 kW 7.1.  It will receive right- and left-circular polarization 
            at 8.4, and 32 GHz. Antenna coordinates are not yet available.
            
            The Canberra Deep Space Communications Complex (CDSCC) is managed by the Commonwealth 
            Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), Australia's national science 
            research agency. The CDSCC is at Tidbinbilla, about 35 km southwest of Canberra, ACT.
