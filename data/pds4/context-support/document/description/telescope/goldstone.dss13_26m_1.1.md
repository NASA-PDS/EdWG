           This fully steerable telescope was a research and development radio/radar antenna that
           was part of the NASA Deep Space Network.  It was first operational in 1962 with a 26-m
           aperture and was named "Venus Station" to commemorate the first radar detection of Venus
           by radar facilities at Goldstone in 1961.  The 26-m antenna was decommissioned in 1991.
           Its cordinates are not known. A 34-m beam waveguide (BWG) antenna was completed in 1991
           at the same general location.  It was given the DSS-13 identifier and was used to 
           contnue research and development work at higher frequencies.
