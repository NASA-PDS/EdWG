           DSS-26 is one of three beam waveguide (BWG) antennas constructed between 1992 and 1996 in a cluster
           at "Apollo Valley" within the Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex (GDSCC) . These antennas
           were the first DSN operational antennas to utilize the BWG design that moves environmentally 
           sensitive electronic equipment into an underground pedestal instead of a centrally mounted feed
           cone structure. The use of the underground pedestal also allows for easier repair, maintenance
           and upgrades. DSS-26 operates at S-, X-, and Ka-band (2, 8, and 34 GHz, respectively).  On S-band 
           its transmitter radiates 250 W; it can receive either right- or left-circular polarization (RCP or
           LCP, respectively).  On X-band, its transmitter is rated for 20 kW; it can receive RCP and LCP
           simultaneously.  At Ka-band it can receive RCP and LCP simultaneously but not transmit. Antenna 
           coordinates were converted from Table 5 in module 301 (revision L) of the DSN Telecommunications
           Link Design Handbook (DSN document 810-005).
