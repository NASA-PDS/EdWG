            The 1m telescopes of the Las Cumbres global network are built to be identical. They are
            Equatorial C-ring mounted Ritchey-Chretian Cassegrain telescopes. Users should consult 
            the data product documentation to determine which telescope was used to record any 
            specific observation when that information is needed.
