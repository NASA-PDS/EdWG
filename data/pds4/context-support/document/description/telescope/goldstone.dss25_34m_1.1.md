           DSS-25 is one of three beam waveguide (BWG) antennas constructed between 1992 and 1996 in a cluster
           at "Apollo Valley" within the Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex (GDSCC) . These antennas
           were the first DSN operational antennas to utilize the BWG design that moves environmentally 
           sensitive electronic equipment into an underground pedestal instead of a centrally mounted feed
           cone structure. The use of the underground pedestal also allows for easier repair, maintenance,
           and upgrades. DSS-25 operates at both X-band and Ka-band (8 and 34 GHz, respectively) with a 20
           kw transmitter at X-band and a 300 W transmitter at Ka-band. DSS-25 can receive right- and 
           left-circular polarization (RCP and LCP, respectively) simultaneously on both bands. Antenna 
           coordinates were converted from Table 5 in module 301 (revision L) of the DSN Telecommunications
           Link Design Handbook (DSN document 810-005).
