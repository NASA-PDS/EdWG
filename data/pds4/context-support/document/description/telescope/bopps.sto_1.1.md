            The Stratospheric TeraHertz Observatory (STO) telescope is a light-weight 
            telescope designed to be carried as part of a balloon-borne payload.  It
            has an 80cm diamater hyperboloid primary mirror designed for maximum 
            performance in the 300-5000nm wavelength range.

            This telescope originally flew on the Stratospheric TeraHertz Observatory 
            and was refitted to be carried by the BOPPS (balloon observatory) gondola.
