           DSS-24 is one of three beam waveguide (BWG) antennas constructed between 1992 and 1996 in a cluster 
           at "Apollo Valley" within the Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex (GDSCC). These antennas
           were the first DSN operational antennas to utilize the BWG design that moves environmentally 
           sensitive electronic equipment into an underground pedestal, instead of a centrally mounted feed
           cone structure. The use of the underground pedestal also allows for easier repair, maintenance,
           and upgrades. DSS-24 operates at both S- and X-band (2 and 8 GHz, respectively) with 20 kW 
           transmitters on both bands. It can receive right- or left-circular polarization (RCP or LCP) at
           S-band and simultaneous RCP and LCP at X-band.  Antenna coordinates were converted from Table 5
           in module 301 (revision L) of the DSN Telecommunications Link Design Handbook (DSN document 810-005).
