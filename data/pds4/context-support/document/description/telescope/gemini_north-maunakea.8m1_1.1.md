The Gemini Observatory consists of twin 8.1-meter diameter optical/infrared
telescopes located on two of the best observing sites on the planet. From their
locations on mountains in Hawai'i and Chile, Gemini Observatory's telescopes can
collectively access the entire sky.

The Frederick C. Gillett Gemini North telescope is located on Hawaii's Mauna Kea as
part of the international community of observatories built to take advantage of the
superb atmospheric conditions on this long dormant volcano which rises about 4,214
meters (13,824 feet) into the dry, stable air of the Pacific.
