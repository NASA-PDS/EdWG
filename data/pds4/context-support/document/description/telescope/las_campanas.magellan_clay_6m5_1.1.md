            The Landon T. Clay telescope is one of a twin pair (with the Walter Baade)
            located on Cerro Manqui at Las Campanas Observatory. The primary mirror is
            an f/1.25 parabaloid with a honeycomb internal structure to reduce weight.
            The telescope optics include active controls, including correction of 
            low-order aberrations by controlling the figure of the primary mirror.
