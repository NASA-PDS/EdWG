            21.0-in (53 cm) reflector telescope at Lowell Observatory, Mars Hill, Flagstaff, AZ, was built for Harold Johnson, in 1953.
            The telescope ushered in photoelectric astronomy at Lowell. The 21-in is the only manually slewed telescope at Lowell
            and is still in use with minimal upgrades since 1953.
