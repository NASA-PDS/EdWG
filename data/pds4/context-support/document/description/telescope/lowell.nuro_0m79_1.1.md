This 0.79-meter (31-inch) telescope was installed in 1964 at Lowellâ€™s Anderson Mesa
Dark Sky Site. The U.S. Geological Survey originally operated it to create geological
maps of the Moon, in support of Project Apollo. Ownership was transferred to Lowell
Observatory in 1972, and it was refurbished in 1990.

This telescope later became a primary research tool for the National Undergraduate
Research Observatory (NURO).

The effective focal length is 11.78 m, and the f/ratio is 15.

The 31-inch telescope is stopped down to 29.5 inches (0.75m). 
The plate scale is 17 arcsec/mm.
