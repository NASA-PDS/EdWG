            Deep Space Station 34 (DSS-34) was built from 1994 to 1997. The antenna is very similar in 
            structure to DSS-45, however the transmission and reception equipment is located underground 
            rather than in a cone at the focal point of the dish. The radio signal is guided from the 
            subreflector through a hole in the surface of the dish to the receiving equipment via a 
            system of reflecting mirrors inside a large tube. The reverse path allows transmission.
            This design is called 'beam waveguide' (BWG); it reduces weight on the reflecting surface,
            insulates electronics from environmental factors including dish movement, and simplifies 
            maintenance. DSS-34 can transmit up to 20 kW at 2.1 and 7.1 GHz.  It can receive right- or
            left-circular polarization at 2.2, 8.4, and 26.2 GHz.  At 32.0 GHz it can receive both 
            polarizations simultaneously.  Antenna coordinates were converted from Table 5 in module
            301 (revision L) of the DSN Telecommunications Link Design Handbook (DSN document 810-005). 
            
            The Canberra Deep Space Communications Complex (CDSCC) is managed by the Commonwealth 
            Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), Australia's national science 
            research agency. The CDSCC is at Tidbinbilla, about 35 km southwest of Canberra, ACT.
