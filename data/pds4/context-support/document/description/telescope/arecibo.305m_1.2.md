	    Arecibo's 305-m fixed spherical reflecting radio antenna was the primary telescope
	    at Arecibo Observatory between 1963 and 2020, when it was irreparably damaged by a
	    series of failures in its supporting cables.  Because the surface was spherical,
	    the antenna used 'line' feeds, each connected to receivers in 'carriage houses'
	    supported above the reflector by towers and cables. In the late 1990s one of the
	    carriage houses was replaced with reflecting optics that corrected the spherical
	    aberration over a wide bandwidth, reduced receiver noise by a factor of several,
	    and made gain less dependent on pointing.  The antenna was 'pointed' over angles of
	    approximately 0-20 degrees from zenith by by moving the carriage houses. Initially
	    the antenna was used for radio astronomy above 50 MHz and solar system radar
	    astronomy (including active probing of Earth's upper atmosphere) at 430 MHz. In the
	    mid-1970s, the reflecting surface was improved and new receivers and transmitters
	    were added, allowing radio observations to 11 GHz and radar operation at 2380 MHz.

        The position of the telescope was determined through surveying and comparison to
        stations determined using the Global Positioning System. The accuracy of the position
        is approximately 1m.
