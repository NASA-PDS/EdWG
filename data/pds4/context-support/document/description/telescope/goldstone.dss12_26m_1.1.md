            Echo Station (DSS-12) is currently the administrative center for the Goldstone Deep Space
            Communications Complex (GDSCC).  Built in 1959 with a 26-m aperture, DSS-12 is named for 
            early experiments performed with the passive balloon satellite, Echo 1.  The antenna is 
            polar mounted, was upgraded to a 34-m aperture in 1979, and was capable of simultaneously 
            operating at both S- and X-band frequencies.  For 37 years, DSS-12 supported many spacecraft 
            including the early Ranger and Surveyor missions to the Moon, deep space missions such as 
            Pioneer and Voyager, and high Earth orbiting spacecraft.  Antenna coordinates 
            are approximate; they were interpolated from coordinates for DSS-13 and DSS-14 in Table 5
            of module 301 (revision L) of the DSN Telecommunications Link Design Handbook (DSN document
            810-005) using the map at https://www.gdscc.nasa.gov/?page_id=37
