The Isaac Newton Telescope or INT is a 2.54 m (100 in.) optical telescope run by the
ING at Roque de los Muchachos Observatory on La Palma in the Canary Islands since
1984.

The La Palma INT is a Cassegrain telescope, with a 2.54 m diameter primary mirror and
a focal length of 8.36 m. The f/3.29 Prime focus, used with the Wide Field Camera,
allows an unvignetted field of view of 33 arcminutes (approximately 0.3 square
degrees). There is also a secondary focal station, the f/15 Cassegrain focus, which
possesses a 20 arcminute field of view and is the mount point for the Intermediate
Dispersion Spectrograph.

The pointing accuracy of the telescope is around 5 arcseconds, but a sophisticated
autoguider, which tracks a given guide star and makes small corrections to the
telescope tracking, allows a guiding accuracy of better than an arcsecond on better
than 20th magnitude guide stars in support of the typical 0.8-1.5 arcsec seeing at
the INT.
