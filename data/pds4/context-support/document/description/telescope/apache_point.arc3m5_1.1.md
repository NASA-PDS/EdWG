The Astrophysical Research Consortium 3.5-meter telescope is located at
            the Apache Point Observatory in the Sacramento Mountains in Sunspot, NM.
            The observatory stands at an altitude of 2788 meters, latitude 32.8
            degrees N, and longitude 105.8 degrees W. The ARC 3.5-meter telescope is
            designed with an altitude-azimuth mount. The primary and secondary mirrors
            provide a working f/number of 10.4 and an effective focal length of 35238.7 mm.
            The telescope was designed to host various instruments simultaneously through 
            the use of multiple Nasmyth ports and a movable tertiary mirror.
