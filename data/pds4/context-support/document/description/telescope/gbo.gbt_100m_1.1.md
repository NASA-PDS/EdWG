            The Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT) is located in Green Bank, 
            West Virginia. The GBT is a parabolic dish covering 2.3 acres. The GBT 
            has the largest collecting area of any fully-steerable telescope in the 
            world.
            
            From the base to the top of its huge feed arm, the GBT stands 485 feet 
            tall. Its 100-meter by 110-meter dish required 7,652 beams to support it 
            on top of a nearly hemispherical tilting gear. A gigantic yoke cradles 
            that gear above a base of concrete sunk 25 feet down to solid Appalachian 
            bedrock.
            
            Over 17 million pounds of telescope glide around its 360-degree concrete 
            track, thanks to four four-wheeled trucks, making the GBT the largest 
            moving object on land. Its remarkable agility allows it to see 85% of the 
            skies surrounding the Earth over the course of a year.
            
            Its 200-foot feed arm is a two-towered trusswork sticking out of the side 
            of the dish and ending in a secondary mirror perched 60 feet above the 
            dish. The secondary aims the dish's focused radio waves into one of eight 
            receivers hanging in a rotating turret. On the fly, a new receiver can be 
            spun into the beam to change the frequency being recorded. A ninth 
            receiver can swing out on a boom arm in place of the secondary, giving 
            astronomers a huge range of science they can pursue with one telescope.
            
            Scientists from around the world use the GBT to observe the skies for 
            6500 hours every year. The GBT's gigantic, unobstructed dish provides 
            scientists with sensitive eyes on the faintest radio objects in the 
            Universe.
