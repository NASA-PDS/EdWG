            Deep Space Station 56 (DSS-56) is scheduled to become operational in September 2020. 
            The antenna is very similar in structure to earlier 34-m DSN antennas; however, the 
            transmission and reception equipment is located underground rather than in a cone at 
            the focal point of the dish. The radio signal is guided from the subreflector through 
            a hole in the surface of the dish to the receiving equipment via a system of reflecting
            mirrors inside a large tube. The reverse path allows transmission. This 'beam waveguide' 
            (BWG) design reduces weight on the reflecting surface, insulates electronics from 
            environmental factors including dish movement, and simplifies maintenance. DSS-56 can 
            transmit up to 250 W at 2.1 GHz and up to 20 kW at 7.1 GHz.  It can receive right- or 
            left-circular polarization at 2.2 GHz and 26.2 GHz; it can receive both polarizations
            simultaneously at 8.4 and 32.0 GHz. Antenna coordinates were converted from Table 5
            in module 301 (revision L) of the DSN Telecommunications Link Design Handbook 
            (DSN document 810-005). 
            
            The Madrid Deep Space Communications Complex (MDSCC) has been managed since December 2012 by
            Ingeniería de Sistemas para la Defensa de España.  MDSCC is located about 65 km west of
            Madrid, near the town of Robledo de Chevala, Spain.
