            Pioneer Station (DSS-11), a 26 meter polar mounted antenna, was the first deep space
            antenna to be constructed at Goldstone. Completed in December 1958, in time to support the 
            Pioneer 3 mission, DSS-11 became the prototype antenna for the Deep Space Network (DSN)
            and went on to track a variety of NASA spacecraft including all Pioneers, the Echo balloons,
            and the Ranger, Lunar Orbiter, Surveyor, Apollo, Helios, Mariner, Viking, and Voyager
            spacecraft. A Manned Space Flight wing was built at the Pioneer site to support the manned 
            space flights of the Apollo program. DSS-11 was officially mothballed in 1981 and was 
            declared a National Historic Monument as the first deep space antenna in the DSN in 1985.
            Antenna coordinates are approximate; they were interpolated from coordinates for DSS-13
            and DSS-14 in Table 5 of module 301 (revision L) of the DSN Telecommunications Link Design
