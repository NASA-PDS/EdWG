            This fully steerable telescope was a dual-shaped reflector radio antenna that was part of the 
            NASA Deep Space Network.  It was first operational in 1986 with a 34-m aperture and was
            decommissioned in October 2016.  When operational, the antenna could receive at frequencies
            in the range 2.0-8.6 GHz in right- or left-circular polarization (but not simultaneously).
            It could transmit 50-250 W at 2.1 GHz or up to 20 kW at 7.1 GHz. Antenna coordinates were 
            converted from Table 5 in module 301 (revision L) of the DSN Telecommunications Link Design 
            Handbook (DSN document 810-005). 
            
            The Canberra Deep Space Communications Complex (CDSCC) is managed by the Commonwealth 
            Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), Australia's national science 
            research agency. The CDSCC is at Tidbinbilla, about 35 km southwest of Canberra, ACT.
