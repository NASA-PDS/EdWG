           This fully steerable telescope is a parabolic reflector radio antenna that is occasionally used
           as part of the NASA Deep Space Network. It can be pointed over elevation angles 30.5-88.5 degrees 
           at all azimuths with an accuracy of better than 1 arcsecond. It is part of the Australia Telescope 
           National Facility, is used at frequencies up to 43 GHz, and was first operational in 1961.
