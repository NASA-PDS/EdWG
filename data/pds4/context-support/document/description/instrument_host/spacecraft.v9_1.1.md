
The Venera 9 spacecraft, like its sister craft Venera 10, consisted of two
parts, a 2283-kg orbiter and an attached 1560-kg descent craft/lander and
entry system. The orbiter was designed to be a communications relay for the
lander and to explore the cloud layers and atmospheric parameters.
Instrumentation included a French 3500 angstrom ultraviolet photometer, a
4000-7000 angstrom photo-polarimeter, a 1.5-3 micron infrared spectrometer,
and a 8-30 micron infrared radiometer. The orbiter also carried a camera
system, magnetometer, energetic particle detectors, and charged particle
traps. Identical instruments were carried the twin Venera 10 spacecraft.

The orbiter 4V bus was based on the M-71 design, and consisted of a 110 cm
diameter central cylinder comprising the UDMH / nitrogen tetroxide tanks
surrounded by a conical compartment with two solar panel wings and a 1.6
meter high gain parabolic antenna attached to the curved surface. A
bell-shaped unit holding the KTDU-425A propulsion system was attached to the
bottom of the cylinder, and mounted on top was a 2.4 meter sphere which held
the descent vehicle. Around the base of the cylinder was a pressurized
toroid 2.35 meters in diameter that held electronics and science
instruments. Power was supplied by a pair of solar panel wings extending
from opposite sides of the cylindrical body, each 1.25 x 2.1 meters in size,
giving a total span of 6.7 meters. Spacecraft attitude control and knowledge
were provided by a gimbaled engine nozzle, nitrogen cold gas jets, and
gyroscopes, with solar sensors, Canopus star sensors, and an Earth sensor.

Communications were provided via the high gain antenna and six
omnidirectional helical antennas, four for communication with Earth and two
for the descent vehicle. The high gain antenna provided communication with
Earth in the decimeter and centimeter wavelength bands. Command uplink was
at 769 MHz through the helical antennas. A 16 MB magnetic tape system was
used for data storage. A boom holding the magnetometer extended from one of
the solar panels. Thermal control was achieved through use of louvers and a
radiator.

Venera 9 was the first mission the first to go into orbit around another
planet and to return pictures from the surface of Venus.
