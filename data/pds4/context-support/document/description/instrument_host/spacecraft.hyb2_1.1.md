The Hayabusa2 spacecraft is designed to obtain samples from the asteroid (162173) Ryugu and to bring back the samples to Earth, to investigate the origin of water and organic materials on Earth. It is important to understand the early history and transfer processes of the Solar System. The sub-systems that comprise the Hayabusa2 spacecraft are the telecommunications system; the power system; the attitude and orbit control system (AOCS). The telecommunications system has three X-band low-gain antennas, XLGA-A, XLGA-B, and XLGA-C, one X-band medium-gain antenna (XMGA), one X-band high-gain antenna (XHGA-T; T means transmission), and one Ka-band high-gain antenna (KaHGA-T; T means transmission). The spacecraft hosts an optical navigation camera (ONC), a laser altimeter (LIDAR; LIght Detection And Ranging), a near-infrared spectrometer (NIRS3), a thermal infrared imager (TIR), laser range finders (LRF), a flash light (FLA) that is used for finding position of target marker, five target markers (TM), a small carry-on impactor (SCI), a deployable camera (DCAM3), a lander developed by DLR and CNES (MASCOT; Mobile Asteroid surface SCOuT), three rovers (MINERVA-II1 Rover-1a, Rover-2a, MINERVA-II2 Rover-2; MINERVA-II is MIcro Nano Experimental Robot Vehicle for Asteroid the Second Generation), a sampler horn, a small monitor camera (CAM-H; CAMera Head), and a re-entry capsule.
