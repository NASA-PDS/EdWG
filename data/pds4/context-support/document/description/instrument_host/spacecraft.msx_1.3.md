  ========================
    The Midcourse Space Experiment (MSX) was a long-duration
    observatory-style measurement platform that collected of
    high-quality data on Earth, Earth-limb, celestial background
    targets, ICBM targets, and resident space objects.  MSX was
    launched in April 1996 into polar orbit, and included a cryogenic
    infrared scanning radiometer and Fourier-transform spectrometer,
    several visible and ultraviolet imagers and spectrographic
    imagers,
    and set of contamination instruments.
