The Akatsuki spacecraft which is also known as Venus Climate Orbiter and PLANET-C is designed to reveal atmospheric circulation of Venus by remote-sensing of different wavelengths, especially the superrotation. The sub-systems that comprise the Akatsuki spacecraft are the telecommunications system; the power system; the attitude and orbit control system (AOCS); the digital electronics which processes image acquired by the cameras onboard. The telecommunications system has two X-band low-gain antennas, XLGA-A and XLGA-B, two X-band medium-gain antennas, XMGA-A and XMGA-B, two X-band high-gain antennas, XHGA-T for transmission and XHGA-R for receiving. The spacecraft hosts Ultraviolet Imager (UVI), 1-micron Camera (IR1), 2-micron Camera (IR2), Longwave Infrared Camera (LIR), Lightning and Airglow Camera (LAC), and Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO) that is a part of Radio Science Subsystem (RSS) and is used for radio science experiments (RS).
