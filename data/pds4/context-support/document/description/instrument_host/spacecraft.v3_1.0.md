
The Venera 3 spacecraft was designed to land on the surface of Venus. The
spacecraft was a 3MV-4 type, originally built for a Mars mission, but
repurposed for Venus. It comprised a 960-kg carrier bus that held a 310-kg
lander probe. The lander probe was attached to one end of the bus and
consisted of a 90 cm sphere with a mass of 310 kg, containing parachutes,
two 32 cm transmitters and antennas. It was battery powered and had a
science payload including atmospheric temperature, pressure, density,
composition, acidity, and electrical conductivity experiments, gamma-ray
sensor, cosmic ray detector, visible photometer, and mercury level
experiment.

The bus spacecraft had a basically cylindrical body topped by a
truncated cone. It was 1.1 meters in diameter, 2.7 meters long (3.6
meters with the attached lander probe) and had a launch mass of 963
kg. It had two solar panel wings, with a total area of 2.6 square
meters, that spanned 4.4 meters and were partially covered with
solar cells. The 60 cm long KDU-414 gimbaled propulsion unit had a
thrust of 2 kN and was mounted on the opposite end from the lander
probe. Communications were provided at \~6000 (5 cm), \~3750 (8 cm),
or 922.776 MHz (\~32 cm) by a 1.7 meter parabolic high-gain dish
antenna and two low-gain antennas. Commands were received at 768.96
MHz (\~39 cm) using the low gain antennas.

Attitude control was achieved using a pneumatic cold gas jet system
and gyroscopes, with Sun, Earth, and star sensors. Power was
provided by the solar cells charging a NiCd battery. Large
hemispherical radiators affixed to the ends of the solar panels and
a hybrid liquid-gas circulating system, along with foil and
fiberglass insulation, provided thermal control. A tape recorder
stored data for transmission sessions, for which the spacecraft had
to be turned so its high gain antenna faced the Earth. A pressurized
compartment held the electronics and science instruments. It carried
a TV imaging system and a suite of scientific instruments, including
spectrometers, micrometeoroid detectors, energetic particle detectors,
ion traps, a magnetometer, radio detector, and cosmic radio emission
receiver. The instruments were mounted on the spacecraft bus, a long
boom, or on the ends of the solar panels.
