    ========================
 
      Planet-A and MS-T5 are identical except for their
      scientific payloads.  The main spacecraft body is a
      cylinder, 140 cm in diameter and 70 cm high.  The
      spinning spacecraft is about 250 cm high, from the
      top of the high- gain antenna dish to the bottom of
      the medium-gain antenna.  Its outer wall is covered
      by solar cells which produce 100 W of power under
      optimum conditions.
 
      An equipment platform mounted to a central thrust
      tube carries most of the subsystems, including the
      mechanically despun, high-gain antenna, two
      hydrazine fuel tanks, the thrusters, and the
      experiment sensors.  A star scanner and a nutation
      damper are attached to the thrust tube.  Planet-A
      and MS-TS weigh 139.5 kg and 138.1 kg,
      respectively, including lO kg of hydrazine
      propellant in each case.  Both spacecraft are
      spin-stabilized, with the facility to change the
      spin rate.  The spin axes of both spacecraft will
      be kept perpendicular to the ecliptic plane.  The
      spacecraft/Earth geometry and the data-rate
      requirements preclude the use of a single antenna
      for the duration of the mission.  The antenna
      subsystem therefore consists of a high-gain
      antenna, a medium-gain antenna as a backup, and a
      low-gain antenna for near-Earth operation.  The
      despun high-gain antenna has an offset- parabolic
      reflector with a diameter of 80 cm and a gain of
      21.5 dB in uplink and 22.5 dB in downlink
      transmission.  The communications subsystem
      operates in 5-band using a 5 W transmitter.  MS-T5
      has four data formats(Table below).  The data rates
      of both spacecraft are 2048 bit/s (without coding)
      in 'high bit rate' and 64 bit/s (with convolutional
      coding) in 'low bit rate' mode.  The bit rate used
      will depend on the communication distance.
 
      The ground station for the mission has been built
      at Usuda, about 170 km northwest of Tokyo.  The
      station's 64 m diameter dish antenna has a gain of
      approximately 63 dB.  A 64 bit/s communication link
      (convolutionally encoded PCM) is expected to be
      possible from 1.1 AU, which will be the comet-Earth
      distance during the Planet-A encounter.
