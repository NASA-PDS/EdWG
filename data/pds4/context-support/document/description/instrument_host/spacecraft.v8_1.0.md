
The Venera 8 spacecraft comprised a 1184-kg carrier bus holding a lander
probe. The lander probe was an insulated spherical pressure vessel with a
mass of 495 kg, of similar design to the Venera 7 probe. It had a top shell
that would be jettisoned on atmospheric entry to deploy the 2.5 square meter
parachute and expose the antenna and instruments. The probe was battery
powered. Its instrumentation included temperature, pressure, and density
sensors as well as an accelerometer, radio altimeter, anemometer, gamma-ray
spectrometer, gas analyzer, visible photometers, and radio transmitters.

The carrier bus was based on the 3MV design used for Venera 4. It was a 3.5
meter high cylinder. Two solar array wings, with an area of 2.5 square
meters, had a span of 4 meters. Due to the spacecraft's proximity to the Sun
at Venus, the wings were only partially covered with solar cells. A 2.3
meter diameter parabolic high-gain dish antenna, along with low gain spiral
cone antennas mounted on booms, provided communications. Gas coolant heat
transfer pipes behind the antenna, which faced away from the Sun, provided
thermal control. Spacecraft attitude control was provided by micro engines
and Sun, Earth, and star sensors. The propulsion system was mounted on one
end and the lander probe on the other. It also contained energetic particle
detectors, solar wind detector, and ultraviolet spectrometer.
