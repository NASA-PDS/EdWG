           The DART spacecraft is a low-cost spacecraft designed to navigate
           autonomously into an impact with Dimorphos, the secondary of the 
           (65803) Didymos system. It carries a single instrument, the 
           Didymos Reconnaissance and Asteroid Camera (DRACO), and will
           also carry the Light Italian CubeSat for Imaging Asteroids 
           (LICIACube) independent spacecraft, which will be released 10
           days prior to launch to observe the impact.
