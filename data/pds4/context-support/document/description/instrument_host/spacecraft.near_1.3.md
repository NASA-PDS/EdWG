 
 The NEAR spacecraft, renamed NEAR Shoemaker, was a solar-powered, three-axis-stabilized 
 spacecraft and was the first spacecraft to fly by, orbit, and land on a small body.
 NEAR carried six scientific instruments:  Multispectral Imager (MSI), Near-Infrared 
 Spectrograph (NIS), X-Ray Spectrometer (XRS), Gamma-Ray Spectrometer (GRS), NEAR Laser 
 Rangefinder (NLR), Magnetometer (MAG), plus the Radio Science Subsystem (RSS).
