The Spitzer Space Telescope was a 3-axis stabilized,
      pointing and scanning observatory in a solar, Earth-trailing orbit
      with three crogenically-cooled instruments operating from the near-
      to far-infrared. The telescope had an aperture of 85 cm, a
      diffraction limit of 5.5 microns, a field of view of ~5 arcmin x 5
      arcmin for each band, a pointing stability of <0.1 arcsec, and a
      maximum tracking rate of 1.0 arcsec/sec. Its three instruments were
      the InfraRed Array Camera (IRAC), InfraRed Spectrograph (IRS), and
      Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer (MIPS).
