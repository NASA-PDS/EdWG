
The Venera 5 and Venera 6 spacecraft were of identical design and launched 5
days apart in January 1969. The spacecraft were designed to make in-situ
measurements as they descended through the Venusian atmosphere. Measurements
included temperature, pressure, composition.

The Venera 5 spacecraft was very similar to Venera 4 although it was of a
stronger design. It comprised a bus with a mass of 1130 kg which held the
descent probe. The probe was spherical with a mass of 405 kg and was
designed for decelerations as high as 450-g. Venera 5 and 6 were designed
with smaller parachutes (15 square meters) than Venera 4 to allow them to
fall faster so as to get lower in the atmosphere while still operational.
The top of the probe would be ejected to deploy the parachute and expose the
instruments to the atmosphere. The probe carried a radio altimeter, two
resistance thermometers, an aneroid barometer, eleven gas analyzer
cartridges, an ionization densitometer, and photoelectric sensors. The probe
also carried a medallion bearing the coat of arms of the U.S.S.R. and a
bas-relief of V.I. Lenin to the night side of Venus.

The bus was essentially identical to the Venera 4 bus but with a stronger
design. It was 3.5 meter high and powered by 2.5 square meters of solar
panel "wings" with a span of 4 meters. A 2.3 meter diameter high-gain
parabolic dish antenna was mounted on the cylinder facing opposite the solar
panels and a cone-shaped omni-directional antenna was mounted at the end of
one of the solar panels. There was a large rocket for mid-course
maneuvering, and a set of smaller thrusters, with Sun, Earth, and star
sensors, for attitude control. Communications from the probe were achieved
by two 1 bit/sec transmitters in the DM waveband. The bus held energetic
particle detectors, charged particle traps, and an ultraviolet photometer.
