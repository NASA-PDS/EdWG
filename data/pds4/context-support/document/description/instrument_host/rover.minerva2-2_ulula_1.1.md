MINERVA-II (MIcro Nano Experimental Robot Vehicle for Asteroid the Second Generation) is the successor of MINERVA installed on the Hayabusa spacecraft. There are two containers, one is MINERVA-II1, and the other is MINERVA-II2. MINERVA-II2 consits of Rover-2, OME-B2 (basic structure; OME is the abbreviation of Onboard Mounted Equipment), and OME-C2 (cover). The Rover-2 was named as ULULA (University-made Landing Unit for Locomotion on Asteroid) after landing to Ryugu. Purpose of Rover-2 is to explore efficient moving mechanism by hopping. There are four actuators onboard, micro-hopping by vibration of cilia utilizing centrifugal force, hopping by permanent magnet action, hopping by bi-metal action caused by ambient temperature change, and hopping with leaf-spring action utilizing spring's elastic energy. Rober-2 has two same cameras called MICAM, six temperature sensors, two accelerometers, and six photodiodes to determine attitude by detecting Sun.
