
The Venera spacecraft 4 consisted of a 3.5 meter high, 1106-kg main bus
carrying a 383 kilogram lander probe with vital instruments encased in a
pressure vessel. The total spacecraft mass was 1106 kg. The probe was
designed to withstand high temperatures, pressures, and accelerations. The
bus was powered by 2.5 square meters of solar panel "wings" with a span of 4
meters. A 2.3 meter diameter high-gain parabolic dish antenna was mounted on
the cylinder facing opposite the solar panels and a cone-shaped
omni-directional antenna was mounted at the end of one of the solar panels.
There was a large rocket for mid-course maneuvering, and a set of smaller
thrusters, with Sun, Earth, and star sensors, for attitude control.
Communications from the probe were achieved by two 922 MHz, 1 bit/sec
transmitters in the DM waveband.

The probe, attached to the end of the carrier bus opposite the propulsion
system, was protected by a heatshield and carried a radar device and
parachutes for descent. The probe carried two thermometers, a barometer, a
radio altimeter, an atmospheric density gauge, 11 gas analyzers, and two
radio transmitters operating in the DM waveband. The main bus carried a
magnetometer, energetic particle detectors, cosmic ray detectors, ion traps,
and far UV photometer that covered hydrogen and atomic oxygen.
