
The Venera 14 spacecraft, like its sister craft Venera 13, comprised two
parts, a flyby carrier bus (flight platform) and an attached lander probe.
The flight platform had instruments to study solar-wind composition,
gamma-ray bursts, ultraviolet radiation, and the electron density of the
ionosphere of Venus. The lander probe carried instruments to study the
characteristics and composition of the atmosphere and surface of Venus.

The Venera 14 flight platform was essentially identical to the Venera 11 and
12 platforms, based on the Soviet 4V design, except for slight differences
in the science payload. The Venera 14 spacecraft, including the lander, had
a total launch mass of about 4395 kg.

The 4V platform consisted of a 110 cm diameter central cylinder comprising
the UDMH / nitrogen tetroxide tanks surrounded by a conical compartment with
two solar panel wings and a 1.6 meter high gain parabolic antenna attached
to the curved surface. A bell-shaped unit holding the KTDU-425A propulsion
system was attached to the bottom of the cylinder, and mounted on top was a
2.4 meter sphere which held the descent vehicle. Around the base of the
cylinder was a pressurized toroid 2.35 meters in diameter that held
electronics and science instruments. Power was supplied by a pair of solar
panel wings extending from opposite sides of the cylindrical body, each 1.25
x 2.1 meters in size, giving a total span of 6.7 meters. Spacecraft attitude
control and knowledge were provided by a gimbaled engine nozzle, nitrogen
cold gas jets, and gyroscopes, with solar sensors, Canopus star sensors, and
an Earth sensor.

Communications were provided via the high gain antenna and six
omnidirectional helical antennas, four for communication with Earth and two
for the descent vehicle. The high gain antenna provided communication with
Earth in the decimeter and centimeter wavelength bands. Command uplink was
through the helical antennas. A 16 MB magnetic tape system was used for data
storage. A boom holding the magnetometer extended from one of the solar
panels. Thermal control was achieved through use of louvers and a radiator.

The bus was equipped with instrumentation including gamma-ray burst
detectors, energetic particle detectors, high energy cosmic ray detectors, a
magnetometer, and two-frequency transmitters. which made measurements
before, during, and after the Venus flyby. Identical instruments were
carried the twin Venera 13 flyby platform.
