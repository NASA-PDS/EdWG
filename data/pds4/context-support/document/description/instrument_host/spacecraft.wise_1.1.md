The WISE spacecraft is about the height and weight of a big polar bear, only wider.
It measures 2.85 meters tall (9.35 feet), 2 meters wide (6.56 feet), 1.73 meters deep
(5.68 feet) and weighs 661 kilograms (1,433 pounds). It is composed of two main
sections: the instrument and the spacecraft bus.
The spacecraft bus was built by Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp, Boulder, Colo.
Ball was also responsible for integrating the instrument to the spacecraft bus and
testing the completed spacecraft.
