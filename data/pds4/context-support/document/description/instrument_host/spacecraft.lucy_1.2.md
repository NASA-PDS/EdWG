Lucy is over 14 meters (over 46 feet) from tip to tip, but most of that is the huge solar panels (each over 7 meters (almost 24 feet) in diameter)  needed to power the spacecraft as it flies out to the orbit of Jupiter. All of the instruments, and the 2-meter (6.5 ft)-high gain antenna needed to communicate with Earth, will be located on the much smaller spacecraft body. Lucyâ€™s instrument pointing platform (IPP) carries four instruments for remote-sensing science, including L'Ralph (MVIC and LEISA), L'LORRI, L'TES, and the Terminal Tracking Camera (TTCAM).
