
The Venera 7 spacecraft was very similar in design to Venera 5 and 6, with a
1180-kg carrier bus holding a spherical lander probe. The probe was designed
to withstand higher pressures and temperatures, as well as the shock of
landing, through the use of a single spherical shell with no seams, welds,
or holes. Titanium was used in the construction of the pressure vessel, and
it was lined with shock absorbing material. The result was a more massive
probe, 490 kg. An even smaller parachute (2.5 square meters) was used to
speed the descent. The lander held a resistance thermometer and an aneroid
barometer.

The bus was essentially identical to the Venera 4 bus. It was 3.5-meter high
and powered by 2.5 square meters of solar panel "wings" with a span of 4
meters. A 2.3 meter diameter high-gain parabolic dish antenna was mounted on
the cylinder facing opposite the solar panels and a cone-shaped
omni-directional antenna was mounted at the end of one of the solar panels.
There was a large rocket for mid-course maneuvering, and a set of smaller
thrusters, with Sun, Earth, and star sensors, for attitude control.
Communications from the probe were achieved by two 1 bit/sec transmitters in
the DM waveband. The bus held a solar wind detector and energetic
particle detectors.

Venera 7 was the first spacecraft to return data after landing on another
planet.
