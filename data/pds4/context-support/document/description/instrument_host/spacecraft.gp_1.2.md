         ========================
 
         The Galileo spacecraft consists of two parts, an orbiter
         (SPACECRAFT_ID = 'GO') and a probe (SPACECRAFT_ID = 'GP').
         Spacecraft power is provided by two radioisotope
         thermoelectric generators. Propulsion is accomplished via a
         bipropellant system of twelve 10- newton thrusters and one
         400 newton engine. The command and data subsystem consists
         of multiple microprocesors and a high-speed data bus.
 
         The Galileo atmospheric probe will be deployed from the
         orbiter 150 days prior to Jupiter encounter. The probe
         consists of a deceleration module and a descent module. It
         weighs about 331 kilograms, half of which is the heat
         shield. After entering the Jovian atmosphere and slowing its
         descent, the descent module deploys a 2.5 meter parachute
         and begins transmitting data from its instruments at a rate
         of 128 bits per second. (Refer to Yeates, et al, 1985;
         Johnson, et al, 1992.)
 
       Platform Description
       --------------------
 
         Platform PROBE DESCENT MODULE
 
           The atmospheric descent module contains seven scientific
           instruments: the atmospheric structure instrument (ASI), the
           neutral mass spectrometer (NMS), the helium abundance
           detector (HAD), the nephelometer (NEP), the net-flux
           radiometer (NFR), the lightning and radio emissions detector
           (LRD), and the energetic particles instrument (EPI). The
           instruments are contained in hermetically sealed housings
           designed to withstand a pressure of 20 bars. The instrument
           data are transmitted to the orbiter over two simultaneously
           operating channels in the L band. (Refer to Yeates, et al,
           1985; Johnson, et al, 1992.)
