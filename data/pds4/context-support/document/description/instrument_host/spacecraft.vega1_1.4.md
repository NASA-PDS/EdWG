
The Vega 1 spacecraft, like its sister Vega 2, comprised two parts, a
flyby bus and a Venus descent module (lander probe) that contained a
balloon aerostat. The spacecraft were developed from earlier Venera craft.

# Vega 1 Spacecraft (Flyby Bus)

The Vega 1 flyby bus, also known as Venera-Halley 1, was three-axis
stabilized. Its main features were large solar panels, a high-gain antenna
dish, and an automatic pointing platform carrying those experiments that
required pointing at the comet nucleus. The automatic platform could rotate
through + or -110 deg and + or -40 deg in two perpendicular directions with
a pointing accuracy of 5 arc-min and a stability of 1 arc-min/s. It carried
the narrow- and the wide-angle camera, the three-channel spectrometer, and
the infrared sounder. All other experiments were body-mounted, with the
exception of two magnetometer sensors mounted on a 2-m boom and various
plasma probes and plasma wave analyzers mounted on a 5-m boom. The total
scientific payload weighed 125 kg and had a data rate of 65 kbs in fast
telemetry mode for encounter. There was also a slow telemetry mode for the
cruise mode. The comet-encounter science data-take was from 2.5 h before
until 0.5 h after the closest approach, with several periods of data-take
before and after, each lasting about 2 h. Continuous coverage for plasma and
dust instruments was provided by an onboard memory (5-megabit tape
recorder). The spacecraft was shielded from hypervelocity dust impacts by a
shield consisting of a 100-micrometer multilayer sheet 20 to 30 cm from the
spacecraft, and a 1-mm Al sheet 5 to 10 cm from the spacecraft.
Approximately half of the Vega spacecraft was devoted to the Halley module,
and half to the Venus lander package. The total scientific payload weight
was 144.3 kg.

# Venus Descent Module (Lander Probe)

The Vega 1 lander probe was identical to those of Venera 9 through 14 and
similarly had two objectives, the study of the atmosphere and the study of
the superficial crust. The lander consisted of a hemispherical insulated
pressure vessel mounted with shock absorbers on a deformable landing ring.
On top of the pressure vessel was a disc-shaped aerobrake which also served
as a reflector for the cylindrical fixed communications antenna above it.
The lander was held during the cruise to Venus and atmospheric entry in an
insulated heat protection sphere 240 cm in diameter, consisting of an upper
and lower hemisphere joined non-hermetically.

In addition to temperature and pressure measuring instruments, the descent
probe carried an ISAV UV spectrometer for measurement of minor atmospheric
constituents, a VM-4 hygrometer dedicated to measurement of the
concentration of H2O, an IPF aerosol analyzer, an ISAV-A particle size
spectrometer/nephelometer and other instruments for determination of the
chemical composition of the condensed phase: a Sigma 3 gas-phase
chromatograph; a BDRP-AM25 X-ray spectrometer observing the fluorescence of
grains or drops; and a Malachite mass spectrograph measuring the chemical
composition of the grains or drops. The X-ray spectrometer separated the
grains according to their sizes using a laser imaging device, while the mass
spectrograph separated them according to their sizes using an aerodynamical
inertial separator. After landing, a small surface sample near the probe was
to be collected by a drilling device and analyzed by a GS-15-SCV gamma ray
spectrometer and X-ray fluorescence spectrometer. The UV spectrometer, the
mass spectrograph, and the pressure- and temperature-measuring instruments
were developed in cooperation between French and Soviet investigators. Data
collected by the instruments were transmitted to the Vega 1 spacecraft and
relayed to Earth. 

# Balloon Aerostat (Probe)

The constant-pressure instrumented, balloon aerostat was deployed from the
upper heat protection hemisphere of the Vega lander probe immediately after
entry into the atmosphere of Venus. The primary scientific objective of the
Vega balloon probes was to obtain information about the large- and
small-scale motions, structure, and cloud properties of the Venus atmosphere
at the float altitude. The probes floated at an altitude of about 54 km in
the middle, most active layer of the Venus three-tiered cloud system and
measured the local atmospheric dynamics, pressure, temperature, lightning,
illumination levels, and cloud properties over a period of about 46 hours in
both the night- and day-side.

The Vega balloon probe comprised a 3.4 meter diameter balloon and a gondola,
suspended below the balloon by a 13 meter long tether strap. The total mass
of the deployed balloon probe was 21.5 kg: 12.5 kg for the balloon and
tether, 6.9 kg for the gondola, and 2.1 kg of helium in the balloon. The
balloon, gondola, parachute, ballast, tanks of helium, and timing
electronics and pyrotechnic release devices with a total mass of 120 kg were
stored in a toroidal compartment surrounding the lander antenna before
deployment.

The balloon was made of a Teflon cloth matrix coated with Teflon film and
filled with helium to 30 mbar overpressure. The diffusion of helium from the
balloon was slow enough that the balloon would outlast the probe battery
lifetime, losing less than 5% of its helium and 500 meters of altitude. The
balloon itself was transparent to the downlink radio frequency used.

The gondola was 1.2 meters high and had three parts, connected by straps.
The upper section, connected to the tether, was a 37 cm long, 15 degree
half-angle conical antenna 14 cm diameter at its base. The middle section
was connected by two straps to the upper section with dimensions
approximately 40.8 x 14.5 x 13.0 cm. The upper part of the section contained
a radio transmitter and modulator, data-handling system, and
signal-processing and power-regulating electronics. The lower part had
pressure and illumination sensors and a deployable arm which held
temperature sensors and an anemometer. The lower section was 9.0 x 14.5 x
15.0 cm, was also connected to the middle section by two straps, and held
the batteries and nephelometer. The gondola was painted with a white coating
that resisted corrosion by sulfuric acid and increased the surface albedo.

The radio transmitter had two modes of operation. In telemetry, or TM, mode
a 30 second transmission of pure carrier signal for use in the VLBI tracking
was followed by a 270 second period of transmission of 900 bits (at 4 bits/s
for the first 840 bits and 1 bit/s for the last 60) of data collected over
the previous 30 minutes, followed by another 30 second carrier transmission.
In coordinated transmission (KI) mode two tones with a suppressed carrier
were transmitted for 330 seconds for use in the VLBI tracking. Three
consecutive TM transmissions and one KI were made every 2 hours during the
first 10 hours and from roughly hours 22 to 34 of the flight, at other times
one TM and one KI transmission were made every two hours to conserve battery
power. The carrier signal frequency was 1.6679 GHz and the radiated power
was about 4.5 W. The power supply consisted of 1 kg of lithium batteries
with 250 W-hrs capacity and an expected life of 46 to 52 hours.

Twenty ground stations were used for Very Long Baseline Interferometry
(VLBI) tracking of the balloons. Six of these stations were on Soviet
territory and were coordinated by IKI, the Soviet space agency. The other
fourteen antennas were coordinated by CNES (France) and included three NASA
Deep Space Network antennas and eleven radio astronomy observatories.
