           The LICIACube is a CubeSat mission of the Agenzia Spaziale Italiana (ASI) that will
           be carried by the DART impactor to the vicinty of the Didymos system, then be released
           to observe the impact and aftermath of the collision of DART with Dimorphos. Note that
           as of this writing, it is not clear if the LICIACube team will archive its results with
           PDS.
