Venera 16 was part of a two spacecraft mission, along with Venera 15,
designed to use 8 cm band side-looking radar mappers to study the surface
properties of Venus from orbit.

The Venera 16 and 15 spacecraft were identical and were based on
modifications to the orbiter (4V bus) portions of the Venera 9 and 10
probes. Each spacecraft was built around a 110 cm diameter, 5 meter long
central cylinder comprising the UDMH / nitrogen tetroxide tanks, with a 6 m
long, 1.4 m wide parabolic dish antenna for the synthetic aperture radar
(SAR) at one end. A 1 meter diameter parabolic dish antenna for the radio
altimeter was also located at this end. The electrical axis of the radio
altimeter antenna was lined up with the axis of the cylinder. The electrical
axis of the SAR deviated from the spacecraft axis by 10 degrees. During
imaging, the radio altimeter would be lined up with the center of the planet
(local vertical) and the SAR would be looking off to the side at 10 degrees.
A bulge at the opposite end of the cylinder held fuel tanks and propulsion
units. Two square solar arrays extended like wings from the sides of the
cylinder. A 2.6 m radio dish antenna for communications was also attached to
the side of the cylinder.

A bell-shaped unit holding the KTDU-425A propulsion system was attached to
the bottom of the cylinder. Around the base of the cylinder was a
pressurized toroid 2.35 meters in diameter that held electronics and science
instruments. Power was supplied by the solar panel wings extending from
opposite sides of the cylindrical body, each 1.25 x 2.1 meters in size,
giving a total span of 6.7 meters. Spacecraft attitude control and knowledge
were provided by a gimbaled engine nozzle, nitrogen cold gas jets, and
gyroscopes, with solar sensors, Canopus star sensors, and an Earth sensor.

Communications were provided via the high gain antenna and six
omnidirectional helical antennas, four for communication with Earth and two
for the descent vehicle. The high gain antenna provided communication with
Earth in the decimeter and centimeter wavelength bands. A magnetic tape
system was used for data storage. Thermal control was achieved through use
of louvers and a radiator. At launch the Venera 16 spacecraft had a mass of
5300 kg. In addition to the radar and altimeter, the scientific instruments
included a radiometric system, infrared spectrometer, energetic particle
detectors, cosmic ray detectors, and a radio occultation experiment.
