
The Venera 2 spacecraft was a 3MV-4 type, originally built for a Mars
mission, but repurposed for Venus. It comprised a 963-kg carrier bus that
held a 310-km flyby module. The flyby module was a 60 cm sphere attached to
one end of the bus, containing an imaging system and three spectrometers.
The bus spacecraft had a basically cylindrical body topped by a truncated
cone. It was 1.1 meters in diameter, 3.3 meters long with the flyby module
and had a launch mass of 963 kg. It had two solar panel wings, with a total
area of 2.6 square meters, that spanned 4.4 meters and were partially
covered with solar cells. The 60 cm long KDU-414 gimbaled propulsion unit
had a thrust of 2 kN and was mounted on the opposite end from the lander
probe. Communications were provided at \~6000 (5 cm), \~3750 (8 cm), or
922.776 MHz (\~32 cm) by a 1.7 meter parabolic high-gain dish antenna and
two low-gain antennas. Commands were received at 768.96 MHz (\~39 cm) using
the low gain antennas.

Attitude control was achieved using a pneumatic cold gas jet system
and gyroscopes, with Sun, Earth, and star sensors. Power was
provided by the solar cells charging a NiCd battery. Large
hemispherical radiators affixed to the ends of the solar panels and
a hybrid liquid-gas circulating system, along with foil and
fiberglass insulation, provided thermal control. A tape recorder
stored data for transmission sessions, for which the spacecraft had
to be turned so its high gain antenna faced the Earth. A pressurized
compartment held the electronics and science instruments. It carried
a TV imaging system and a suite of scientific instruments, including
spectrometers, micrometeoroid detectors, energetic particle detectors,
ion traps, a magnetometer, radio detector, and cosmic radio emission
receiver. The instruments were mounted on the spacecraft bus, a long
boom, or on the ends of the solar panels.
