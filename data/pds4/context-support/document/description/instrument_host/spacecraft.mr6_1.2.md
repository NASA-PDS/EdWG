    ===================
      The Mariner 6 and 7 spacecraft were three-axis stabilized,
      solar-powered, capable of providing continuous telemetry
      transmission, and fully automatic, but commandable from Earth
      when necessary.  They each weighed 380 kg.  The solar panels
      provided 450 watts at Mars.  The instrument payload was 59 kg.
      Telemetry channels were available at data rates between 8.33
      and16200 bps.  Both analog and digital tape recorders were used;
      the former handled television data only.
 
 
    Platform Descriptions
    =====================
      The Mariner 6 and 7 spacecraft used a two-axis scan platform
      carrying the infrared radiometer, cameras, UV spectrometer, and
      infrared spectrometer.  It was used to reposition the fields of
      view of the instruments repeatedly during the Mars flyby.
