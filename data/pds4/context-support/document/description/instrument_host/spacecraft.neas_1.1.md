      The NEAS spacecraft is a 6U CubeSat using a controllable solar sail (Lockett et al 2020) with the main science
      objective to encounter and characterize near-Earth asteroid 2020 GE.  A simple monochromatic camera will be used 
      for optical navigation and to answer the science knowledge gaps of the target asteroid.  The NEAS camera along 
      with the spacecraft subsystems (navigation, guidance and control, etc.) will allow the NEAS mission to gather 
      and downlink data to Earth.  Additional information on the mission and instrument can be found within the 
      published literature.
