            The Mars 2020 mission placed the rover Perseverance on the surface of Mars in Jezero Crater on
            February 18, 2021. The rover's instruments search for signs of habitable conditions on Mars in 
            the ancient past and signs of past microbial life. The rover uses a drill to collect samples 
            for return to Earth by a future mission.
