           Lunar Trailblazer is a NASA SIMPLEX mission to acquire simultaneous, nested high-resolution near-infrared spectral images and thermal infrared data. The payload consists of 
           the High-resolution Volatiles and Minerals Moon Mapper (HVM3) and the Lunar Thermal Mapper (LTM). The mission will study the mineralogy of the lunar surface at all latitudes, 
           including within Permanently Shadowed Regions.
