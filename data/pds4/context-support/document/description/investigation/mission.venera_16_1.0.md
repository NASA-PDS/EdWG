
The Soviet Venera 16 and Venera 15 missions consisted of two
identical spacecraft designed to use 8 cm band side-looking radar
mappers to study the surface properties of Venus. The two spacecraft
were inserted into Venus orbit a day apart with their orbital planes
shifted by an angle of 4.45 deg relative to one another. This made
it possible to reimage an area if necessary. Each spacecraft was in
a nearly polar orbit with a periapsis at 62 deg N latitude.
Together, the two spacecraft imaged the area from the north pole
down to about 30 deg N latitude with a resolution of one to two km
over the 8 months of mapping operations.

Venera 16 was launched on 7 June 1983 at 02:32 UT, five days after
the Venera 15 launch. Launch took place from Baikonur Cosmodrome
(Tyuratam) on a Proton-K booster. After two course corrections on 15
June and 5 October, it arrived at Venus and went into a 977.3 x
67,078 km altitude, 24 hour, 34 minute period orbit on 14 October
1983 at 06:22 UT. Radar mapping began on 20 October, and Venera 16
moved into its operational orbit, 944 x 65,336 km, with the
periapsis at 62 deg N, on 22 October.

Venera 15 and 16 completed their primary mapping mission, as
described above, on 10 July 1984 and began an extended science
mission. On 13 June 1985, Venera 16 received a command that was
transmitted to Vega 1. (The two probes shared the same frequency.)
The command caused Venera 16 to go into an unnecessary orientation
maneuver that resulted in it using up its remaining attitude control
propellant. It could no longer be oriented and contact was lost,
ending the mission.
