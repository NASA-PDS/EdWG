In 1976, Dr. Ronald Greeley and Dr. James Iversen used hand-held cameras to acquire photographs of the volcanic cindercone Amboy Crater and its surrounding lava flows, located in the Mojave Desert of southeast California. These photographs are mostly black and white (but some are color) and were taken at low altitude from a fixed-wing aircraft, on the ground near volcanic outcrops, and of flows from close up. The purpose of the images was to depict volcanic features on Earth that could be studied as an analog to features similar to those found on Mars and the Moon.
