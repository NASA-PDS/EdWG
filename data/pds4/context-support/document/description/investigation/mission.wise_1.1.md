WISE launched into the morning skies above Vandenberg Air Force Base in 
      central California on Dec. 14, 2009. By early 2011, it had finished scanning the entire 
      sky twice in infrared light, snapping pictures of three-quarters of a billion objects, 
      including remote galaxies, stars and asteroids. Today, astronomers continue to mine a cosmic 
      quarry of data provided by WISE.
