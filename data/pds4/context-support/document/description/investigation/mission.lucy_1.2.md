Lucy will be the first space mission to explore a population of small bodies known as the Trojans. The Trojans are outer
           Solar System asteroids that orbit the Sun “in front of” and “behind” the gas giant Jupiter, at the same distance from the Sun as
           Jupiter. The gas giant is massive enough that normally it scatters away all asteroids in its vicinity, but, due to the combined
           gravitational influences of the Sun and Jupiter, these Trojan asteroids have been trapped on stable orbits (around what is known
           as the Lagrange Points) for billions of years. These Trojans provide a unique, never-before-explored sample of the remnants of our
           early Solar System.
