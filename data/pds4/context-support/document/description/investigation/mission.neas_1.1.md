      The NEAS spacecraft is a 6U CubeSat using a controllable solar sail with the main science objective to encounter and characterize NEA 2020 GE.  A simple monochromatic camera will be used for optical navigation and to answer the science knowledge gaps of the target asteroid.  The NEAS camera will be capable of resolutions of less than 10 cm at a distance of 800 m from the asteroid.
