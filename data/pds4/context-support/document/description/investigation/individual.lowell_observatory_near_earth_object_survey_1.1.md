The Lowell Observatory Near-Earth Object Survey (LONEOS) was a 10-year program (1998-2008) at Lowell Observatory that searched for Near Earth Objects (NEOS).  This survey used a 0.6m Schmidt telescope located on Anderson Mesa about 19 km from the Lowell Observatory main campus on Mars Hill located near the center of Flagstaff, AZ.  The initial phase of LONEOS (LONEOS-1) used a CCD camera developed at the University of Washington. In 2000, this camera was replaced with the much larger and more sensitive camera developed for the project and was used for the remainder of the Survey, LONEOS-2, which ran until 2008.
