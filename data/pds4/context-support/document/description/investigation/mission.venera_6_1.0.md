
The Venera 6 mission and its twin, Venera 5, formed a pair of
identical Soviet spacecraft, each consisting of a carrier bus and a
descent craft (lander probe) of identical design. Launched five days
apart in 1969, the objectives of the missions were to make in-situ
measurements as the spacecraft descended through the Venusian
atmosphere. Measurements included temperature, pressure,
composition.

Venera 6 was launched into an Earth parking orbit on 10 January 1969
at 05:51:52 UT and then from a Tyazheliy Sputnik (69-002C) towards
Venus . After a mid-course maneuver on 16 March the Venera 6 probe
was released on 17 May 1969, about 25,000 km from the planet. It
entered the nightside atmosphere at 06:05 UT and deployed the
parachute. The probe sent back readouts every 45 seconds for 51
minutes and ceased operation due the temperature and pressure
effects at roughly 10 to 12 km altitude, over 5 degrees S,
23 degrees E.

Some reports state the photometer on the descent probe failed to
operate, but in any case it did not measure any light above the 0.5
W per square meter threshold. The atmosphere was sampled at 2 bar
and 10 bar pressures. Approximately 70 pressure measurements and 50
temperature measurements were returned during the descent. The
mission confirmed the high temperatures, pressures, and carbon
dioxide composition (93-97%) and lack of water vapor of the
atmosphere found by Venera 4. Together the Venera 5 and 6 probe data
allowed a more precise determination of the atmospheric composition.
