             The DSN Media Calibration investigation is the set of observations and analyses
             used by the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) to develop calibrations for the effects
             of the ionosphere, troposphere, and local weather on propagation of radio signals
             between DSN antennas and spacecraft.  Although small, these effects are measurable
             and can change the apparent range to and velocity of spacecraft being tracked by 
             the DSN.
