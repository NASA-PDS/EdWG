
The Soviet Venera 13 mission returned the first color images and
audio recordings from the surface of Venus. Along with the Venera 14
mission, it formed a pair of identical spacecraft, each consisting
of a flyby carrier bus and a descent craft (lander probe), built to
take advantage of the 1981 Venus launch opportunity. Launched five
days apart, the objective of the missions was to make in-situ
studies of the Venus atmosphere and surface.

Venera 13 launched on 30 October 1981 at 06:04:00 UT on a Proton-K
booster from Baikonur Cosmodrome (Tyuratam). The four month cruise
to Venus involved two mid-course corrections, on 10 November 1981
and 21 February 1982. On 27 February 1982, the descent craft
separated from the carrier bus and plunged the Venus atmosphere on 1
March 1982. The parachute was deployed at 63 km altitude. At an
altitude of 47 km the parachute was released and simple airbraking
was used the rest of the way to the surface. The descent lasted
about an hour. Venera 13 landed at 03:57:21 UT at 7.5 S, 303 E, just
east of the eastern extension of an elevated region known as Phoebe
Regio. The area was composed of bedrock outcrops surrounded by dark,
fine-grained soil. After landing an imaging panorama was started and
a mechanical drilling arm reached to the surface and obtained a
sample, which was deposited in a hermetically sealed chamber,
maintained at 30 degrees C and a pressure of about .05 atmospheres.
The lander survived for 127 minutes (the planned design life was 32
minutes) in an environment with a temperature of 457 degrees C and a
pressure of 89 Earth atmospheres.

The Venera 13 lander probe returned the first color images of the
surface of Venus, revealing an orange-brown flat bedrock surface
covered with loose regolith and small flat thin angular rocks. The
composition of the sample determined by the X-ray fluorescence
spectrometer put it in the class of weakly differentiated
melanocratic alkaline gabbroids, similar to terrestrial leucitic
basalt with a high potassium content. The acoustic detector (GROZA)
returned the sounds of the spacecraft operations and the background
light 0.5 m/sec wind.  

As the carrier bus flew by Venus with a closest approach of 36,000
km on 1 March 1982, it acted as a data relay for the brief life of
the descent craft, and then continued on into a heliocentric orbit.
As a test to provide engineering data for the upcoming flyby of
1P/Halley by the Vega spacecraft, the engine was fired on 10 June
and 14 October 1982 . The platform transmitted data from
interplanetary space until at least 25 April 1983.
