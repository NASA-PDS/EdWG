            The New Horizons Kuiper Belt Extended Mission is a mission to a
            recently discovered, unexplored region of the solar system, the
            Kuiper Belt. The centerpiece of the mission is a close flyby of
            Kuiper Belt Object (KBO) (486958) Arrokoth (2014 MU69). The mission will also
            aggressively survey the KB using NH as an observatory, examining many
            other Kuiper Belt Objects and Centaurs while studying the Kuiper Belt
            dust, gas, plasma, and energetic particle environments. Doing so
            will place both 2014 MU69 and the Pluto system in better context
            among Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs), increasing scientific understanding
            of both.
