
The Soviet Venera 15 and Venera 16 missions consisted of two
identical spacecraft designed to use 8 cm band side-looking radar
mappers to study the surface properties of Venus. The two spacecraft
were inserted into Venus orbit a day apart with their orbital planes
shifted by an angle of 4.45 deg relative to one another. This made
it possible to reimage an area if necessary. Each spacecraft was in
a nearly polar orbit with a periapsis at 62 deg N latitude.
Together, the two spacecraft imaged the area from the north pole
down to about 30 deg N latitude with a resolution of one to two km
over the 8 months of mapping operations.

Venera 15 was launched on 2 June 1983 at 02:38:39 UT, five days
before the Venera 15 launch. Launch took place from Baikonur
Cosmodrome (Tyuratam) on a Proton-K booster. After two course
corrections on 10 June and 1 October, it arrived at Venus and went
into a 904.3 x 67,687 km altitude, near-polar orbit on 10 October
1983 at 03:05 UT. Radar mapping began on 16 October, and Venera 16
moved into its operational orbit, 873 x 65,000 km, with the
periapsis at 62 deg N, on 2 November. Full science operations began
on 11 November.

Venera 15 and 16 completed their primary mapping mission, as
described above, on 10 July 1984 and began an extended science
mission. By 30 December 1984 the attitude control system had used up
its propellant, and on 5 January 1985 last contact was made.
