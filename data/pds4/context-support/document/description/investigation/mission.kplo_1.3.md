      KPLO (Korea Pathfinder Lunar Orbiter), or Danuri (다누리),
      is the first Korea robotic lunar probe expected to carry out a
      lunar observation mission at a nominal orbiting altitude of
      ~100 km from the Moon. It is a cooperative project between
      the Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI), which will
      oversee the system, main body of the orbiter, and ground
      station, and a Korea university, research institutes, and NASA
      supporting the payloads, deep space communication, and
      navigation technology. The KPLO spacecraft consists of
      the main body of the orbiter, propulsion systems, tracking
      systems, three communications antennae, two solar arrays,
      and six payloads. The KPLO project involves mapping the
      lunar environment, technology demonstrations for planetary
      exploration, international cooperation, and establishing a
      deep-space network. The KPLO mission is a large portion of
      phase one of the Korea Lunar Exploration Program (KLEP)
      and Korea’s exciting journey into space exploration.
