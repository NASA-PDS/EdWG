    ================
 
    Observations made during the 1995-1996 Saturn Ring Plane Crossing
    (RPX) led to the unexpected finding that the positions of both
    Prometheus and Pandora varied significantly from the predictions
    based on the Voyager observations (BOSH&RIVKIN1996,
    NICHOLSONETAL1996, MCGHEEETAL2001, SYNNOTTETAL1983). A long term
    observing campaign was undertaken in order to extend the time line
    of astrometric observations.
 
    The campaign used archival HST data from 1994, previously
    unexamined RPX images, and a large series of targeted WFPC2
    observations between 1996 and 2005. The ultimate goals were to
    refine the ephemerides of both satellites and if possible
    determine the cause or causes of the discrepancies.
 
    Sufficient observations to produce astrometrically meaningful data
    for nine other satellites were obtained incidentally in the
    Prometheus-Pandora observing campaign.
 
    Details of the project can be found in FRENCHETAL2006.
