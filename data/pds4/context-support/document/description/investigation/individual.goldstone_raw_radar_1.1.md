 The  Goldstone Solar System Radar (GSSR) is the only 
            fully steerable radar in the world for high-resolution ranging and 
            imaging of planetary and small-body targets. The resulting data 
            provides both scientific and programmatic benefits, including 
            investigations of the Moon, planets, and other solar system bodies,
            including near-Earth objects (NEOs). These studies provide images
            and topography, and information on surface characteristics, shapes,
            composition, orbits, rotations, and distribution of liquids or ice
            on or below their surfaces. This investigation deals with raw data
            consisting of complex base-band samples with real part or in-phase
            (I) and the complex part or quadrature (Q), recorded from various
            open loop receivers or recorders: Portable Fast Sampler (PFS), 
            GSSR Processing Computer (GPC) at various sample rates. Since 
            GSSR transmits right circular polarized (RCP)  light, the 
            opposite-sense circular polarization (OCP, sometimes called 
            "polarized") is always left circular polarized (LCP) and the 
            same-sense circular polarization (SCP, sometimes called 
            "depolarized") is always RCP. The raw radar data can be used to 
            generate frequency spectra or delay-Doppler image maps, depending 
            on the transmitted waveform.
