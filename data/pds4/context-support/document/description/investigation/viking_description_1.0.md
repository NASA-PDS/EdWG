# Viking Project Description

## Mission Overview

<span class="mark">The Viking mission to Mars consisted of four
spacecraft: the two orbiters VO1 and VO2, and the landers VL1 and VL2
(Soffen, 1977). During cruise to Mars the landers were attached to the
orbiters; the combined spacecraft were then known as Viking 1 and 2. The
role of the orbiters was to transport the landers to Mars, to carry
reconnaissance instruments for certifying the landing sites, to act as
relay stations for lander data, and to perform their own scientific
investigations. The initial orbit periapses were placed over the
candidate landing sites to allow for maximum viewing resolution and
relay of the lander data. After the primary lander missions were
completed, the orbiters’ orbits were allowed to drift so that the entire
planetary surface could be systematically mapped by the three remote
sensing experiments.</span>

<span class="mark">The Viking 1 spacecraft was launched August 20, 1975,
and arrived at Mars on June 19, 1976. Lander 1 was deployed to the Mars
surface on July 20, 1976. The VO1 orbital inclination of 38-39 degrees
was chosen to optimize communication with VL1. Viking 2 was launched
September 9, 1975 and arrived at Mars August 7, 1976. VL2 landed on
September 3, 1976, at a more northerly site than VL1. The VO2 orbit was
correspondingly more inclined than VO1; initially 55 degrees, it was
later adjusted to 80 degrees, providing particularly good coverage of
polar regions. The areocentric locations of VL1 and VL2 have since been
determined to be (22.270N, 48.264W) and (47.669N, 226.032W),
respectively (Yoder and Standish, 1997).  
  
Mission Phases</span>

<span class="mark">The timeline for the Viking Mission is divided into a
number of mission phases in terms of the types of observations and level
of activity. The references (Snyder, 1977), (Snyder, 1979),  
(Moore et al., 1987), and (Snyder and Moroz, 1992) provide detailed
descriptions of these mission phases. A summary of the mission phases
and the relevant dates are described below. Before Mars encounter and
orbit insertion the orbiter and lander spacecraft are considered as one
spacecraft with the same mission phases. The primary missions for all
four spacecraft (VL1, VO1, VL2, and VO2) are listed separately because
each has a different starting date. All mission phases after the primary
mission are listed only once because all four spacecraft operated
together.

</span>*Viking Extended Mission*<span class="mark">  
The Viking Extended Mission began after solar conjunction. The two
orbiters continued to observe the surface and atmosphere of Mars. The
two lander spacecraft analyzed additional soil samples and dug three
deep holes in the surface. All four spacecraft monitored the planet
through the cycle of seasons. During the winter season, the landers
operated in an automatic manner designed to allow the spacecraft to
survive the cold temperatures and still return some data.

</span>*Viking Continuation Mission*<span class="mark">  
Primary objectives of the Continuation Mission were to make orbital
observations at times of the Mars year that were missed due to landing
site selection and solar conjunction and to collect high resolution
surface images when the atmosphere was clear. A radio science solar
conjunction relativity experiment was also done during the Continuation
Mission. Lander activities consisted of measurements by the imaging,
meteorology, and XRFS instruments operating in a fully automated manner.
Viking Orbiter 2 developed a leak in its propulsion system and lost its
attitude control gas. VO2 was turned off on July 25, 1978 after 706
orbits around Mars.

</span>*Viking Interim Period*<span class="mark">  
The Interim Period mission phase occurred during the time of the Voyager
2 encounter with Jupiter. Thus, communications to and from the Viking
spacecraft were limited. The landers continued to operate in an
automated manner making imaging and meteorology observations. A final
VL2 surface sampler sequence was conducted during this mission phase as
an engineering test in the cold temperatures of mid winter. Orbital data
stored on spacecraft tape recorders and not returned during the
Continuation Mission were downlinked during the Interim Period.

</span>*Viking Survey Mission*<span class="mark">  
The prime scientific objective for VO1 during the Survey Mission was to
obtain high resolution images of possible future landing sites. The plan
for the landers was to collect image and meteorology data for as long as
possible. Because VL2 no longer had a direct downlink capability, it
meant that VL2 could return data only as long as VO1 provided a relay
link, once every seven weeks. Communications with VL2 ended on April 11,
1980 after its batteries could no longer hold a charge. VL2 operated on
the surface of Mars for 1281 sols. VO1 consumed the last of its attitude
control gas on August 7, 1980 and was turned off after 1485 orbits
around Mars.

</span>*Viking Completion Mission*<span class="mark">  
Viking Lander 1 continued to operated in its automatic mode during the
Completion Mission. The observation sequences were cyclic. VL1 returned
via direct downlink image and meteorology data about once a week with
image sequences repeating every 37 sols. The VL1 high-gain antenna was
programmed to track the Earth until December, 1994. However,
communications were lost in November 1982 after a command sequence
uplink.

Mission</span> Objectives

<span class="mark">Exploration of Mars, and the Viking Mission in
particular, has been part of a larger quest -- the search for better
understanding of the formation and history of the solar system. For
Mars, the specific objectives have included:  
1) evolution and current structure of its interior;  
2) characteristics of the surface, including its chemistry and physical
nature;  
3) evolution and current composition and structure of its atmosphere;  
4) nature of the climate, including controls on both daily and seasonal
variations;  
5) whether life is, or ever has been, present.</span>

<span class="mark">Although most Viking investigations could be defended
on one or more of the first four objectives, virtually all secondarily
addressed the fifth. On the other hand, the investigations that focused
primarily on objective \#5 barely scratched the surface of that single
question; the nature of life – and especially its expression on another
planet -- is not well understood. According to Soffen (1977), "It was
finally decided to send a set of biological tests that range in their
environmental setting from a totally aqueous milieu, rich in organics,
to a Marslike environment with no water or any other additives. Even so,
only a very narrow set of all possibilities could be tested on the small
samples acquired ...".</span>

<span class="mark">The Viking investigations and their primary
objectives are summarized in the paragraphs below. More information is
available in Soffen (1977), Snyder (1977, 1979), and Snyder and Moroz,
(1992).</span>  
<span class="mark"></span>  
*Orbiter Imaging*<span class="mark">  
</span>An early objective was assisting in landing site selection and
certification. Once the landers were safely in place, the Orbiter
imaging system was used to provide a geologic context for the surface
observations. Globally, images were collected to provide high-resolution
mosaics and maps at resolutions approaching 100 meters. Stereo pairs of
images could be used to derive local topography; photoclinometry could
be used on single images to derive elevations and slopes at lower
accuracy. Images were also used to infer the origin and history of major
terrain types, including disruptive events such as apparent catastrophic
floods. Crater morphologies which suggest a permafrost layer pointed
toward complex interactions of regolith and atmosphere. The Orbiter
imaging system was also used to monitor atmospheric changes including
clouds, hazes, and suspended particles. Images of the satellites Phobos
and Deimos showed their surfaces from distances as close as 100
km.<span class="mark">  
  
</span>*Mars Atmospheric Water Detector (MAWD)* <span class="mark">  
MAWD was designed to measure the water vapor content of the atmosphere
from orbit. Patterns were sought as a function of local time, season,
latitude, and elevation. Objectives of the investigation included better
understanding of both diurnal and seasonal transport of water vapor as
well as location of sources and sinks.  
  
</span>*Infrared Thermal Mapping (IRTM)*<span class="mark">  
IRTM measured reflections and emissions in several infrared bands from
orbit. These data could be used to infer the physical properties of
surface materials including the relative proportions of rock, sand, and
dust. Apparent surface temperatures were used to infer the composition
of polar ices, assisting in development of atmospheric circulation
models.  
  
</span>*Radio Science*<span class="mark">  
Radio tracking of the Landers allowed determination of their positions
on the surface, the planetary rotation axis, the spin rate, and moment
of inertia. Tracking of the Orbiters allowed determination of a gravity
field for Mars. Radio occultations yielded planetary radii and
atmospheric temperature-pressure profiles at dozens of locations. Radio
observations were also conducted to measure structure in the solar
corona and to test a prediction of general relativity associated with
passage of the radio path through the Sun's gravitational field.  
  
</span>*Entry Science*<span class="mark">  
During descent each landing module measured both the physical structure
and chemical ionosphere allowed inference of dominant reactions. At
lower altitudes isotopic ratios could be used to infer age of the
atmosphere and an earlier composition. Measurements such as mean
molecular weight, density profile, and composition near the surface
could be used to interpret measurements from other instruments.
Measurements at different altitudes could be used to determine how well
the atmosphere was mixed.  
  
</span>*Lander Imaging*<span class="mark">  
Lander images were used to select samples for testing in the biology and
physical properties investigations; they were also used to select sites
for experiments using the sampler arm. Images recorded trenches that
were dug, rocks that were overturned, footpads that penetrated the
surface, and magnets that were covered by iron-bearing loose material.
Images were used to determine the distribution and appearance of rocks
and other materials near the landing sites, leading to improved
understanding of both the local area and its history. Images of the
atmosphere were used to estimate the opacity due to suspended particles;
images of materials at the site were used to infer wind stress and rates
of erosion. One unfulfilled objective of Lander imaging was detection of
signs of life at each site.  
  
</span>*Physical and Magnetic Properties*<span class="mark">  
The sampler arm and sample collector on each Lander were used in
conjunction with the Lander imaging system to determine density,
cohesion, and other physical properties of the surface material.
Repeated failure to collect rocks in the 1 cm size range suggested they
are scarce, which has implications for creation and destruction of
material in that size range. Visual evidence that magnets were saturated
was important in estimating the concentration and state of iron in
surface particles.  
  
</span>*Seismology*<span class="mark">  
The objectives of the Lander seismology investigation were to detect
seismic events or to set limits on the activity level of Mars compared
with Earth. One local event was detected at VL2, allowing estimation of
crustal thickness and damping. In practice the seismology investigation
supported the meteorology investigation since most seismic signals
turned out to be caused by wind.  
  
</span>*Meteorology*<span class="mark">  
The Lander meteorology investigation sought to characterize local
atmospheric conditions; those in turn would constrain global models.
Diurnal and seasonal trends were sought; effects of dust storms were
also measured.  
  
</span>*Inorganic Chemistry*<span class="mark">  
Elemental compositions of soils at each Lander site were determined
using X-Ray Flourescence Spectrometers. Results were to be compared with
compositions of terrestrial analogs but were found to be 'dissimilar to
any single known mineral or rock type' (Toulmin et al., 1977). With
addition of physical properties, the recent history of duricrust could
be inferred. The fact that these materials were very similar at the two
Landing sites can be used in modeling transport of dust and other small
diameter particles.  
  
</span>*Molecular Analysis*<span class="mark">  
The Gas Chromatograph Mass Spectrometer (GCMS) gave composition of the
atmosphere at each landing site; the result was consistent with the
entry science composition. Isotope ratios were used to infer the amount
of outgassing and, from that, the volume of volatiles which may have
been lost from Mars over geologic time. Surface samples were analyzed in
an attempt to detect organics and to measure the amount of water
present. Both are questions important in the search for life.  
  
</span>*Biology*<span class="mark">  
</span>The original objectives of the Lander biology experiment were to
detect presumed Martian life forms by their release of metabolic
products upon addition of heat, water, a dilute aqueous solution of
simple nutrients, and a concentrated mixture of many organic compounds.
After sudden and surprising positive results, which were not consistent
with expectations or with other observations, the objectives were
expanded to include abiotic interpretations<span class="mark">.
