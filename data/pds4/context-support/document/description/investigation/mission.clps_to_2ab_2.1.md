            The NASA payload suite on Astrobotic Peregrine Mission 1 was slated to provide some of the first 
            measurements from the surface of the Moon since Apollo, but it did not land on the lunar
            surface due to an anomaly with the propulsion system. The spacecraft was targeting a landing 
            within Sinus Viscositatis in order to provide complementary and meaningful data to NASAâ€™s Lunar-VISE 
            instrument suite, which will land on the nearby Gruithuisen Domes in 2026.
            The NASA payloads aboard Astrobotic Peregrine 1 were focusing on characterizing the radiation 
            environment in space and on the surface, volatiles present on or near the surface, and surface 
            temperatures and mineralogy. The payload also included the Laser Retroreflector Array (LRA) which 
            could have enabled precise laser ranging from orbiting spacecraft. Because the Peregrine spacecraft 
            never landed on the Moon, all of the data acquired during the mission occurred in cislunar space. 
            This allowed for measurements of the radiation environment experienced by the spacecraft during the 
            mission as well as measurements of volatiles released by the spacecraft during operations and as a 
            result of the anomaly experienced in the propulsion system. Except for the LRA, all other NASA payloads 
            were powered on at various points and collected science data.
