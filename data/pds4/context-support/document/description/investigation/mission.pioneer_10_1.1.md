  ================
    The Pioneer mission set the stage for U.S. space exploration.
    Pioneer 1 was the first manmade object to escape the Earth's
    gravitational field. Later Pioneer 4 was the first spacecraft to fly
    to the moon, Pioneer 10 was the first to Jupiter, Pioneer 11 was the
    first to Saturn and Pioneer 12 was the first U.S. spacecraft to
    orbit another planet, Venus. The following table summarizes the
    Pioneer spacecraft and scientific objectives of the Pioneer mission.

    Pioneer 10 was launched March 2, 1972. It flew by Jupiter, with
    perijove occuring December 3, 1973. Following the Jupiter Encounter
    the spacecraft continued onward on a path towards the heliopause,
    and out of the Solar System. The spacecraft continued returning
    scientific data until the end of its science mission March 31, 1997.
    Last contact was made January 23, 2003.
