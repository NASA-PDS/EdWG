# Mars 2020: Perseverance Rover Mission Description

## Mission Overview

The goals of the Mars 2020 mission are to seek signs of life and to collect rock and soil samples for a possible future return to Earth. The Perseverance Rover explores the landing site and acquires imaging, spectroscopy, and other measurements to characterize Martian soils, rocks, atmosphere, and other aspects of the environment. Perseverance carries seven scientific instruments and a sample acquisition and caching system. The various payload elements are used as an integrated suite of tools to characterize the local geology, to study particular rock and soil targets, to characterize the local environment, and to acquire and cache selected rock and soil samples. The prime mission for the rover is expected to be 836 sols (approximately 2.5 Earth years), with the possibility of an extended mission of unknown duration after that.

The seven science instruments can be classified into the following groups. Table 1 lists key aspects of each science investigation.

Remote sensing: Mounted on the top of a mast are the Mastcam-Z multispectral, stereoscopic imaging system with zoom capability provided by Arizona State University (PI: James Bell); SuperCam, a suite of six instruments in one including a laser-induced breakdown spectrometer, Raman spectrometer, Time-Resolved Fluorescence spectrometer, visible and infrared spectrometer, remote micro-imager, and microphone provided by Los Alamos National Laboratory (PI: Roger Wiens); and mounted on the body of the rover is RIMFAX, a ground-penetrating radar (GPR) provided by Forsvarets Forskning Institute (FFI), Norway (PI: Svein-Erik Hamran).

Proximity science: On the end of the robotic arm are PIXL, a microfocus X-ray fluorescence instrument provided by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (PI: Abigail Allwood), and SHERLOC, Deep UV (DUV) resonance Raman and fluorescence spectrometer provided by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (PI: Luther Beegle).

Both proximity science instruments have mapping capabilities supported by their own integrated imagers. In addition, SHERLOC includes a second imager (WATSON) to be used for science and engineering purposes with high spatial resolution, color, and infinity focus.

Environmental measurements: Mounted on the mast is MEDA, a meteorology package provided by the Centro de Astrobiología/ Instituto Nacional de Tecnica Aeroespacial (PI: José Antonio Rodríguez-Manfredi).

In-situ resource utilization: Mounted on the rover body is MOXIE, a demonstration of In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) technologies provided by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) (PI: Michael Hecht).

Technology demonstration: The Mars 2020 rover carries a helicopter as a technology demonstration. The helicopter will fly up to 5 times over a ~30 sol period early in the mission. The helicopter carries two cameras, one for navigation and one for capturing aerial views for science evaluation. The images are stored onboard during flight, and then are transmitted to the rover afterwards for relay to Earth.
