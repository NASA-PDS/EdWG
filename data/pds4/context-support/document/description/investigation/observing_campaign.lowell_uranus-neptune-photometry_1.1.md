            This observing campaign collates photometric observations of Uranus and Neptune (1972-2016) in the b (472 nm) and y (551 nm) filters of the Str√∂mgren photometric system at Lowell Observatory.
            Observations recorded mainly seasonal variations of disk-integrated albedos of these objects. This bundle includes 360 observations of Uranus and 433 observations of Neptune
            from 1972-2016. The work was led by Wes Lockwood from Lowell Observatory.
