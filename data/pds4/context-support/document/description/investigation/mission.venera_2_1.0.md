
Venera 2, the second Soviet mission to Venus, aimed to study the
planet’s atmosphere, magnetic field, radiation, and surface
temperature, and to photograph it during approach. Venera 2
comprised a carrier bus and an attached flyby module.

Venera 2 and its Tyazheliy Sputnik platform (65-091B) lifted off
from Baikonur on 12 November 1965 at 5:02 UT into an Earth parking
orbit. Venera 2 was then launched from the platform into a
heliocentric orbit towards the planet Venus. Communications during
cruise to Venus were generally poor and sporadic. On 27 February
1966 at 02:52 UT, the spacecraft passed Venus at a distance of
23,950 km and entered a heliocentric orbit. The spacecraft
communication system had ceased to operate on February 10, before
the planet was reached, and returned no data from the encounter. The
system failed because radiator elements did not function correctly
and allowed it to overheat. Attempts to contact the spacecraft were
ended on March 4, the craft continued in heliocentric orbit.
