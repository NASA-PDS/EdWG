
The Venera 7 mission was one of two identical Soviet missions, each
consisting of a carrier bus and an attached descent craft (lander
probe), launched to Venus during the August 1970 opportunity. The
other mission (Cosmos 359) failed to leave Earth orbit. The
objectives of the missions were to return data from the Venus
atmosphere, make a landing on the surface, and continue to return
data after landing. Venera 7 was the first spacecraft to return data
after landing on another planet.

Venera 7 was launched on 17 August 1970 at 05:38:22 UT into an Earth
parking orbit and then from a Tyazheliy Sputnik towards Venus. Two
mid-course corrections were made, on 2 October and 17 November. The
lander probe was allowed to cool to -8 degrees C before atmospheric
entry. The Venera 7 probe separated from the bus and entered the
nightside atmosphere of Venus on 15 December 1970 at 04:58:44 UT.

After aerodynamic braking, the top hatch was blown and the parachute
system was deployed, exposing the antenna and commencing
transmissions at 4:59:28. The hatch was designed to be released at
700 mb pressure, planned to be about 60 km altitude, although 700 mb
is now known to correspond to about 52.5 km. A commutator failure
meant no direct pressure measurements were returned, only
temperature was transmitted. The descent continued with the
parachute in reefed mode, until it opened at 5:09:41 UT, dropping
descent speed from 27 to 19 m/s. Six minutes later, at 5:15:46 UT,
the parachute ripped, and then collapsed, leading to an increase in
velocity from 15 to 26 m/s and leaving the probe to free fall
towards the surface for another 29 minutes, albeit slowed by the
thickening atmosphere. The probe impacted on the Venus surface at
05:34:10 UT at about 16.5 meters/sec and the signals weakened,
reached full strength for about one second, and then seemingly
ceased.

Later analysis of the recorded radio signals revealed that the probe
had survived the impact and continued transmitting a weak signal for
another 23 minutes, until 5:57:08 UT. It is believed that the
spacecraft may have bounced upon impact and come to rest on its
side, so the antenna was not pointed towards Earth. The pressure
sensor had failed during the descent, but the temperature sensor
showed an initial reading of 474 C at the surface for 50 seconds,
followed by a steady reading of 457 C, and a pressure of 92 bar with
a wind of 2.5 meters/sec was extrapolated from other measurements.
These are in good agreement with our current values for the Venus
atmosphere. The landing point was 5 degrees S, 351 degrees E, in the
Navka Planitia region.
