
Venera 3 mission aimed to explore Venus and land on its surface.
The Soviet Venera 3 mission comprised a carrier bus and an attached
descent craft (lander probe). The descent craft contained a radio
communication system, scientific instruments, electrical power
sources, and medallions bearing the coat of arms of the U.S.S.R.
The probe impacted Venus on 1 March 1966, making Venera 3 the first
spacecraft to reach the surface of another planet. However, the
communications systems had failed on 16 February, before planetary
data could be returned.

Venera 3 launched on 16 November 1965 at 04:13 UT from Baikonur
Cosmodrome. A mid-course correction was performed on 26 December 1965.
On 16 February 1966 contact with Venera 3 was lost. Loss was
thought to be due to overheating of the spacecraft. The spacecraft
continued on to Venus and released its lander probe autonomously. It
reached Venus, entered the atmosphere, and reached the surface on
1 March 1966. Although communications had failed, estimates of the
impact site put it in an area between 20 N and 30 S latitude, and
60 to 80 E longitude, with impact at approximately 06:56 UT.
