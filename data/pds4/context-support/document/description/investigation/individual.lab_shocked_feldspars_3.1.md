This investigation consists of data acquired from thin sections created from a suite of experimentally shocked 
            plagioclase feldspars (associated with Jaret et al., 2018), and a basalt and basaltic andesite 
            (associated with Johnson et al., 2020). The data products comprise (1) micro-Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) thermal 
            infrared hyperspectral image cubes; (2) thermal infrared point spectra acquired with two different detectors (for the 
            plagioclase samples only); (3) micro-Raman spectra; (4) microscope images of the thin sections in plane polarized and 
            cross polarized light; and (5) microscope images of the locations of the Raman and thermal infrared point spectra. The 
            thermal infrared and Raman spectroscopy demonstrate changes as a function of shock pressure, as detailed in 
            Jaret et al., 2018 and Johnson et al., 2020.
