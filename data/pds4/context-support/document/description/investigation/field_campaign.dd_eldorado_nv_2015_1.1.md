        A dust devil field campaign in Eldorado Playa, Nevada conducted over 2012-2013 by Brian Jackson and Ralph Lorenz. The work was published in JGR in 2015.
        Terrestrial dust devils serve as planetary analogs to dust devils on Mars. The remote meterological stations used in this study provided pressure and temperature
        data for dust devil encounters in the desert. In some cases measurements of voltage were also acquired.
