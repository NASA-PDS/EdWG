IRAS was launched on January 26, 1983 from Vandenburg Air Force Base in
    California.  It was a joint program of the United States, the
    Netherlands, and the United Kingdom.  The primary mission of IRAS was to
    conduct a sensitive and unbiased survey of the sky in four wavelength
    bands centered at 12, 25, 60, and 100 microns.  It also made pointed
    observatons of selected astronomical and solar system objects.
