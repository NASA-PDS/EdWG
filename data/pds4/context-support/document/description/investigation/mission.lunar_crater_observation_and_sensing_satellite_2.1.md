LCROSS was launched as a secondary payload with the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) on June 18, 2009. After LRO separated to perform its mission, 
            LCROSS used the spent Atlas upper stage, called the Centaur, to impact the moon while LCROSS instruments observed the resulting ejecta cloud. The LCROSS 
            shepherding spacecraft then became an impactor itself. Many Earth-based telescopes observed both impacts on October 9, 2009.
