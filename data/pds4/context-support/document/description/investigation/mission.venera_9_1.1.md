
The Soviet Venera 9 was the first mission to return pictures from
the surface of Venus and the first to go into orbit around another
planet. The mission comprised two spacecraft, an orbiter and an
attached descent craft and entry system (lander probe). The orbiter
relayed communications for the lander and studied the atmosphere and
cloud layers of Venus. The descent craft made in-situ measurements
in the Venus atmosphere and on the surface.

Venera 9 was launched on 8 June 1975 at 2:38 UT on a Proton-K
booster from Baikonur Cosmodrome (Tyuratam). There were two
mid-course corrections en-route to Venus, on 16 June and 15 October.
The second burn put the orbiter into a 1,500 x 111,700 km altitude,
48.3 hour period orbit at an inclination of 34.17 degrees. This made
Venera 9 orbiter the first spacecraft to go into orbit around
another planet. The orbit was changed over the next few days to a
1547 x 112,144 km orbit with an inclination of 34.15 degrees. After
conducting 17 surveys from 26 October to 25 December 1975, the
transmitter on the orbiter failed, ending the mission. 

On 20 October 1975, the descent craft was separated from the
orbiter, and landing was made at 05:13 UT on 22 October. A system of
circulating fluid was used to pre-cool the lander to -10 C and
distribute the heat load. This system permitted operation of the
spacecraft for at least 53 min after landing. During descent, heat
dissipation and deceleration were accomplished sequentially by a
protective hemispheric aeroshell heat shield (released at 64 km
altitude), three parachutes (jettisoned at 50 km), the disk-shaped
drag brake, and a compressible, metal, doughnut-shaped, landing
cushion which absorbed the shock of the 7 m/sec impact and held many
of the instruments. The landing was at 31.7 N, 291 E, near Beta
Regio, about 2,200 km from the Venera 10 landing site. The panoramic
imaging system could only take a 180 degree image instead of the
planned 360-degree panorama because one of the two covers failed to
release. According to Soviet reports, transmission ceased after 53
minutes because the orbiter relay passed out of range of the lander.

Preliminary results from the descent craft indicated: (A) clouds
30-40 km thick with bases at 30-35 km altitude, (B) atmospheric
constituents including HCl, HF, Br, and I, (C) surface pressure
about 90 (earth) atmospheres, (D) surface temperature 485 deg C, (E)
light levels comparable to those at earth midlatitudes on a cloudy
summer day, and (F) successful TV photography showing shadows, no
apparent dust in the air, and a variety of 30-40 cm rocks which were
not eroded. 

The nearly identical Venera 10 mission launched six days later, on
14 June.
