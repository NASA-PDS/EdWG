            This data bundle contains all of the data presented in the paper "Far-Ultraviolet Photometric Characteristics of JSC-1A and LMS-1 Lunar 
            Regolith Simulants: Comparative Investigations With Apollo 10084" as published in Volume 127, Issue 11 of the Journal of Geophysical 
            Research: Planets. The purpose of this study was to measure the far-ultraviolet (FUV) reflectance properties of the lunar simulants 
            JSC-1A and LMS-1 and compare these properties to those found for the Apollo 11 soil sample 10084 (published previously by U. Raut et al.).
            Comparing the FUV reflectance of these two simulants and the lunar soil sample provided an opportunity to disentangle the potential 
            contributions of mineralogy and space weathering to lunar soil FUV reflectance. This study's results indicated that titanium-bearing 
            mineral content strongly affects the overall brightness of these soils in the FUV, while space weathering features may correlate to 
            differences in the scattering anisotropy of the soils.
