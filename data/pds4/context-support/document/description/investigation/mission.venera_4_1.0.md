
The Venera 4 mission was designed with the announced scientific
objective of in-situ studies of the atmosphere of Venus down to the
surface. The Soviet Venera 4 mission comprised a carrier bus and an
attached descent craft (lander probe). It was the first probe to
transmit data from the atmosphere of another planet.

Venera 4 was launched into Earth orbit with an upgraded Molniya_M
and VL upper stage on 12 June 1967, and then sent into a Venus
trajectory from a Tyazheliy Sputnik (67-058B) platform. After a
mid-course correction on 29 July, the lander probe was released from
the bus and entered the nightside Venusian atmosphere on 19 October
1967 at 04:34 UT. Before entry the lander probe was cooled to -10
degrees C. The main bus entered the atmosphere behind the probe but
was not designed to survive entry. The lander probe initially braked
using a thick ablative heatshield. At a velocity of 1032 km/hr the
2.2 meter drogue parachute was deployed, followed by a 55 meter main
parachute at an altitude of 52 km.

At parachute deployment, the radar altimeter antennas would also be
released to protrude over the edge of the lander probe. The
scientific instruments had been turned on 5 minutes after separation
at an altitude of about 55 km and remained on for 93 minutes,
returning 23 sets of readings, until it reached an altitude of
roughly 25 km, where it either ran out of power (the batteries were
designed for roughly 100 minutes and it ended 93 minutes into the
descent) or succumbed to the atmospheric pressure (22 bar) and
temperature (277 C). The probe was over the Eisila region at
approximately 19 degrees N, 38 degrees E.

The atmosphere was denser than expected, so the parachutes slowed
the lander probe more than planned. The probe measured an
atmospheric composition of 90 - 95% carbon dioxide. The bus
spacecraft detected no magnetic field or radiation belts and a weak
finding of atomic hydrogen at 9900 km altitude. It was initially
believed that the probe had reached the ground and the measured
temperature and pressure represented the surface values on Venus.
But it confirmed the prevailing belief that the lower Venus
atmosphere was extremely hot and showed that pressures were at the
high end of most estimates.
