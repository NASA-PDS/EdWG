    The primary science goals of the New Horizons mission are to
    characterize the global geology and morphology of Pluto and Charon, to
    map the surface composition of Pluto and Charon, and to characterize
    the neutral atmosphere of Pluto and its escape rate 
    (NASA AO 01-OSS-01 (2001); Stern & Spencer (2004)).
