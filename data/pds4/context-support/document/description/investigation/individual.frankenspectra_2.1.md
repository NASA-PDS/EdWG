            The purpose of this investigation was to analyze, using reflectance spectroscopy, 27 fine-particulate 
            (less than 10-um) terrestrial minerals to create a far-UV through MIR single spectrum built from the best pieces 
            of spectra acquired at different U.S. and international labs (i.e., Frankenspectra). Multiple-laboratory spectral 
            comparisons increased confidence in determining both better spectral shapes and overall representative reflectance 
            values by considering the reflectance data of each sample as an ensemble.
            
            The four laboratories used to acquire the fine-particulate reflectance spectra included the University of Colorado 
            Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP, Boulder, CO), the Planetary Science Institute (PSI, Tucson, AZ), 
            the University of Winnipeg's Centre for Terrestrial and Planetary Exploration (C-Tape) Planetary Spectrophotometer 
            Facility (UW, Manitoba, Canada), and the Planetary Emissivity Laboratory (PEL, that performs reflectance measurements 
            as well as emissivity) at the German Aerospace Center (Deutsches Land und Raumfahrt, DLR) in Berlin, Germany.
