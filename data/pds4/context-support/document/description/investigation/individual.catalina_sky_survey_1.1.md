The Catalina Sky Survey (CSS) is a NASA funded project supported by the Near-Earth Object
            Observation Program (NEOO) under the Planetary Defense Coordination Offices (PDCO). It
            is based at the University of Arizona's Lunar and Planetary Laboratory in Tucson,
            Arizona. 
            
            The mission at CSS is fully dedicated to the discovery and tracking of near-Earth
            objects (NEOs). This is in an effort to meet the U.S. Congressional mandate to catalogue at least 90
            percent of the estimated population of NEOs larger than 140 meters. Some of these NEOs classify as
            potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs) which pose a potential impact threat to Earth.
