    ============================
 
      This entity is a collection of selected Earth-based radar data
      of Venus, the Moon, Mercury, and Mars, Pioneer Venus radar data,
      airborne radar images of Earth, and line of sight acceleration
      data derived from tracking the Pioneer Venus Orbiter and Viking
      Orbiter 2.  Included are 12.6 centimeter wavelength Arecibo
      Venus radar images, 12.6 to 12.9 cm Goldstone Venus radar images
      and altimetry data, together with altimetry, brightness
      temperature, Fresnel reflectivity and rms slopes derived from
      the Pioneer Venus Radar Mapper.
 
      For the Moon, Haystack 3.8 centimeter radar images and Arecibo
      12.6 and 70 centimeter radar images are included.  Mars data
      include Goldstone altimetry data acquired between 1971 and 1982
      and a raster data set containing radar units that model
      Goldstone and Arecibo backscatter observations.  Mercury data
      consist of Goldstone altimetry files.  The terrestrial data were
      acquired over the Pisgah lava flows and the Kelso dune field in
      the Mojave Desert, California, and consist of multiple
      frequency, multiple incidence angle views of the same regions.
 
      Data set documentation is provided, with references that allow
      the reader to reconstruct processing histories.  The entire data
      set collection and documentation are available on a CD-ROM
      entitled Pre-Magellan Radar and Gravity Data.
