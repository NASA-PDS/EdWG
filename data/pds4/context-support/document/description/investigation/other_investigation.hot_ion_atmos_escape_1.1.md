        Initially started as part of the PDART 2014 efforts of Robert Johnson, this investigation is designed to collate results of 
        modeling and laboratory work in atmospheric escape studies. Data associated with this project include cross section tables
        for different atmospheric species representing different chemical reactions occuring in the upper atmosphere of planets.
