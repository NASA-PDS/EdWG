
The Soviet Venera 10 mission comprised two spacecraft, an orbiter
and an attached descent craft and entry system (lander probe). The
orbiter relayed communications for the lander and studied the
atmosphere and cloud layers of Venus. The descent craft made in-situ
measurements made in-situ measurements of the Venus atmosphere and
surface.

Venera 10 was launched on 14 June 1975 at 03:00:31 UT on a Proton-K
booster from Baikonur Cosmodrome (Tyuratam). After two mid-course
corrections on 21 June and 18 October, the orbiter released the
descent craft on 23 October and performed two burns, one on 23
October and one on 25 October. The second burn put the orbiter into
a 1,500 × 114,000 km altitude, 49.38-hour period orbit at an
inclination of 29.5 degrees. The orbit was changed over the next few
days to a 1651 x 113,923 km orbit with an inclination of 29.1
degrees. The orbiter transmitted data until at least June 1976.

After separating from the orbiter on 23 October 1975, the descent
craft entered the Venus atmosphere at 01:02 UT on 25 October. A
system of circulating fluid was used to pre-cool the lander and
distribute the heat load. During descent, heat dissipation and
deceleration were accomplished sequentially by a protective
hemispheric aeroshell heat shield, three parachutes (jettisoned at
49 km altitude), the disk-shaped drag brake, and a compressible,
metal, doughnut-shaped, landing cushion which absorbed the shock of
the impact and held many of the instruments. The descent craft
landed at 02:17 UT on 25 October at 16 N, 291 E near Beta Regio. It
transmitted for 65 minutes after landing, until the orbiter was out
of range to act as a relay. As with Venera 9, the panoramic imaging
system could only take a 180 degree image instead of the planned
360-degree panorama because one of the two covers failed to release.

Preliminary results from the descent craft indicated: (A) profile of
altitude (km)/pressure (earth atmospheres)/temperature (deg C) of
42/3.3/158, 15/37/363, and 0/92/465, (B) successful TV photography
showing large pancake rocks with lava or other weathered rocks in
between, and (C) surface wind speed of 3.5 m/s.

The nearly identical Venera 9 mission launched six days earlier, on
8 June.
