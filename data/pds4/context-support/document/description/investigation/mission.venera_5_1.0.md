
The Venera 5 mission and its twin, Venera 6, formed a pair of
identical Soviet spacecraft, each consisting of a carrier bus and a
descent craft (lander probe) of identical design. Launched five days
apart in 1969, the objectives of the missions were to make in-situ
measurements as the spacecraft descended through the Venusian
atmosphere. Measurements included temperature, pressure,
composition.

Venera 5 was launched into an Earth parking orbit on 5 January 1969
at 06:28:08 UT and then from a Tyazheliy Sputnik (69-001C) towards
Venus. After a mid-course maneuver on 14 March 1969, the lander probe was
released from the bus on 16 May 1969 at a distance of 37,000 km from
Venus. The probe entered the nightside atmosphere at 06:01 UT and
when the velocity slowed to 210 m/sec the parachute deployed and
transmissions to Earth began. The probe sent read-outs every 48
seconds, cycled from the various instruments through a commutator,
for 53 minutes before finally succumbing to the temperature and
pressure at roughly 320 C, 27 bar, at an initial altitude reading of
24-26 km, later determined to be closer to 18 km altitude, over 3
degrees S, 18 degrees E.

Approximately 70 pressure measurements and 50 temperature
measurements were returned during the descent. The mission confirmed
the high temperatures, pressures, and carbon dioxide composition
(93-97%) and lack of water vapor in the atmosphere found by Venera
4. No nightglow above 0.5 W per square meter was detected, with the
exception of one reading of 25 W per square meter approximately 4
minutes before end of transmission.
