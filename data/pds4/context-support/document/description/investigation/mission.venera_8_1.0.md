
The Venera 8 mission was one of a pair of Soviet missions, each
consisting of a carrier bus and an attached descent craft (lander
probe), designed for the spring 1972 launch window. The other
mission (Cosmos 482) failed to leave Earth orbit. The objectives of
the missions were to make a more sophisticated set of scientific
measurements at the Venus surface, including studies of the Venus
regolith.

Venera 8 launched on 27 March 1972 at 04:15:01 UT on a Molniya-M
with an NVL upper stage from Baikonur. It took 117 days to reach
Venus with one mid-course correction on 6 April 1972.
Before reaching Venus the lander probe interior was cooled to -15 degrees
C. It separated from the bus on 22 July 1972 at 07:44 UT and entered
the atmosphere on the sunlit side, about 500 km from the morning
terminator, at 08:37 UT at an angle of 77 degrees. Descent speed was
reduced from 11.6 km/s at entry to about 250 m/s at 67 km
altitude by aerobraking. The parachute opened in reefed mode at an
altitude of 60 km, and a refrigeration system was used to cool the
interior components. Venera 8 transmitted data during the descent
from instrument turn-on at 50 km. At 30 km altitude the parachute
was fully opened. A decrease in illumination was noted at 35 to 30
km altitude and wind speeds of less than 1 km/s were measured below
10 km. The descent probe landed at 09:32 UT at approximately 10.70 degrees
south, 335.25 degrees east, at 6:24 local Venus solar time, solar
zenith angle was 84.5 degrees. It continued to send back data for 63
minutes after landing before failing due to the harsh surface
conditions. The carrier bus transmitted data from its instruments
until entering the atmosphere and incinerating.

The probe confirmed the earlier data on the high Venus surface
temperature and pressure (470 degrees C, 90 atmospheres) returned by
the earlier Venera 7 mission, and also measured the light level as
being suitable for surface photography, finding it to be similar to
the amount of light on Earth on an overcast day with roughly 1 km
visibility. The first measurements of the surface regolith of Venus
were returned, and a profile of the cloud layer, including detection
of sulfuric acid, was made.
