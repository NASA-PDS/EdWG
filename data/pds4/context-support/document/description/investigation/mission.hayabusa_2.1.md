The Hayabusa spacecraft was successfully launched atop a Japanese M-V       
            launch vehicle on May 9, 2003.  The mission plan was to have the            
            spacecraft briefly alight upon the surface of near-Earth asteroid 25143     
            Itokawa, fire pellets into the surface, collect the surface material        
            ejecta and bring these surface samples back to Earth for intensive study.
