
Venera 11 and Venera 12 were twin Soviet missions, launched five
days apart, to study Venus and the interplanetary medium. Both
missions consisted of a flight platform (bus) and a descent craft
(lander probe). Identical instruments were carried on both
spacecraft. The flight platform had instruments to study solar-wind
composition, gamma-ray bursts, ultraviolet radiation, and the
electron density of the ionosphere of Venus. The lander probe
carried instruments to study the characteristics and composition of
the atmosphere and surface of Venus.

Venera 11 was launched on 9 September 1978 on a Proton-K booster
from Baikonur Cosmodrome (Tyurtam). It went into a 177 x 205 km,
51.5 degree inclination Earth orbit from which it was propelled into
a 3.5 month Venus transfer orbit which involved two mid-course
corrections on 16 September and 17 December. On 23 December 1978,
the descent craft separated from the flight platform and entered the
nightside Venus atmosphere two days later at 11.2 km/sec. During the
descent, the probe employed aerodynamic braking followed by
parachute braking and ending with atmospheric braking. It made a
soft landing on the surface at 03:24 UT on 25 December after a
descent time of approximately 1 hour. The touchdown speed was 7-8
m/s. The landing site was 14 S, 299 E. Information was transmitted
to the flight platform for retransmittal to Earth until it moved out
of range 95 minutes after touchdown. The lens cover on the imaging
system failed to eject, so no images were returned. The soil sample
was not placed correctly into the chamber, so the planned analysis
could not be done.

The flight platform made scientific measurements during cruise.
After ejection of the lander probe, the flight platform continued on
to Venus. Near encounter with Venus occurred on 25 December 1978, at
approximately 34,000 km altitude. The flight platform acted as a
data relay for the lander craft for 95 minutes until the lander
stopped transmitting, and then continued on and returned its own
measurements on interplanetary space. After a trajectory maneuver on
7 February 1979 used up most of its propellant, it ended up in a
1.116 x 1.715 AU orbit. Final contact with Venera 11 was on 1
February 1980.

Results reported included evidence of lightning and thunder, sulfur
and chlorine in the cloud layers, a high Ar36/Ar40 ratio, and the
discovery of carbon monoxide at low altitudes.
