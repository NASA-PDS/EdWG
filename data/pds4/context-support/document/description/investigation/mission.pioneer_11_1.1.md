  ================
    The Pioneer mission set the stage for U.S. space exploration.
    Pioneer 1 was the first manmade object to escape the Earth's
    gravitational field. Later Pioneer 4 was the first spacecraft to fly
    to the moon, Pioneer 10 was the first to Jupiter, Pioneer 11 was the
    first to Saturn and Pioneer 12 was the first U.S. spacecraft to
    orbit another planet, Venus. The following table summarizes the
    Pioneer spacecraft and scientific objectives of the Pioneer mission.

    Pioneer 8 1967-12-13  Solar Orbit   Still operating
    Pioneer 9 1967-11-08  Solar Orbit   Signal lost in 1983
    Pioneer E 1969-08-07  Solar Orbit   Launch failure
    Pioneer10 1972-03-02   Jupiter      Communication terminated 1998
    Pioneer11 1973-04-05 Jupiter/Saturn Communication terminated 1997
    Pioneer12 1978-05-20    Venus       Entered Venus atmos. 1992-10-08
 
    Pioneer 11 was launched April 5, 1973. The mission included flybys
    of Jupiter (periapsis December 2, 1974), and Saturn (periapsis
    September 1, 1979). Following the Saturn Encounter the spacecraft
    continued onward on a path towards the heliopause, and out of the
    Solar System. The science mission ended September 30, 1995. Last
    contact was made in November 1995.
