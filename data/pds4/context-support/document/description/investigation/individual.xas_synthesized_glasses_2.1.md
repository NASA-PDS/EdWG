            Multivariate techniques were used to enable accurate XAS measurements of Fe, Cr, Mn, and Ti ratios across the whole spectral region through creation of a broad suite of 
            experimentally homogenized glasses of geological relevance for use as XAS standards. Iron, Cr, Mn, and Ti were analyzed as epoxy-mounted polished glass beads using XAS at 
            the GeoSoilEnviroCARS beamline at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory using a spot size of ca. 1x1 Î¼m.
