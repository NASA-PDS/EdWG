            The Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission is a technology demonstration mission
            funded by NASA to send a kinetic impactor into the smaller component of a double asteroid
            system and measuring the effect on the target's orbit about its primary. The target of the
            mission is (65803) Didymos and its satellite, Dimorphos. The DART spacecraft is the impactor
            and carries a single instrument, th Didymos Reconnaissance and Asteroid Camera for OpNav
            (DRACO). The NASA-funded mission includes a groundbased component comprising several 
            observatories that will be characterizing the Didymos system before and after the impact
            to measure the effects on the period of Dimorphos to within 7.3 seconds. In addition, the
            Light Italian Cubesat for Imaging of Asteroids (LICIACube) will ride along on the DART 
            spacecraft and be released ten day prior to impact to observe the event in situ.
