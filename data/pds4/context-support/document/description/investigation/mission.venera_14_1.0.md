
The Soviet Venera 14 mission and its twin, the Venera 13 mission,
formed a pair of identical spacecraft, each consisting of a flyby
carrier bus and a descent craft (lander probe), built to take
advantage of the 1981 Venus launch opportunity. Launched five days
apart, the objective of the missions was to make in-situ studies of
the Venus atmosphere and surface.

Venera 14 launched on 4 November 1981 at 05:31:00 UT on a Proton-K
booster from Baikonur Cosmodrome (Tyuratam). During the four month
cruise to Venus, an error was made in the first mid-course
correction on 14 November 1981, necessitating two additional
maneuvers, on 23 November 1981 and 25 February 1982. On 3 March
1982, the descent craft separated from the carrier bus and plunged
into the Venus atmosphere two days later. After entering the
atmosphere a parachute was deployed at an altitude of about 63 km,
activating the atmospheric instruments. At an altitude of 47 km the
parachute was released and simple airbraking was used the rest of
the way to the surface. Venera 14 landed at 07:00:10 UT about 950 km
southwest of Venera 13 near the eastern flank of Phoebe Regio at 13
deg 15 min S by 310 E on a basaltic plain. After landing an imaging
panorama was started and a mechanical drilling arm reached to the
surface and obtained a sample, which was deposited in a hermetically
sealed chamber, maintained at 30 degrees C and a pressure of about
.05 atmospheres. The lander survived for 57 minutes (the planned
design life was 32 minutes) in an environment with a temperature of
470 degrees C and a pressure of 94 Earth atmospheres.

The composition of the sample obtained by the lander was determined
by the X-ray fluorescence spectrometer, showing it to be similar to
terrestrial oceanic tholeiitic basalts. The seismometer detected two
events, although these may have been associated with the lander
operations. The nephelometer identified three distinct cloud layers.
The acoustic detector returned sounds of the spacecraft operations
and background wind. 

As the carrier bus flew by Venus with a closest approach of 26,000
km on 3 March 1982, it acted as a data relay for the brief life of
the descent craft, and then continued on into a heliocentric orbit.
As a test to provide engineering data for the upcoming flyby of
1P/Halley by the Vega spacecraft, the engine was fired on 14
November 1982. The platform transmitted data from interplanetary
space until 9 April 1983.
