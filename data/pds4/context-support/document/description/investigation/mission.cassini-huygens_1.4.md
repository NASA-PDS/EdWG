            Cruise Objectives.
            -----------------
            
            While en route to Saturn, Cassini performed three sets of Gravitational
            Wave Experiments (GWEs), each scheduled near opposition and each lasting
            approximately 40 days.  During these observations, Cassini acted as a point
            mass which would be perturbed by propagating gravitational waves resulting
            from sudden destruction (or creation) of large masses in the general
            direction of the spacecraft-to-Earth line.
            
            While en route to Saturn, Cassini was also used in two Solar Conjunction
            Experiments (SCEs), each lasting approximately 30 days.  The objectives of
            these observations were to test general relativity and to improve our
            understanding of the solar corona.
            
            The general scientific objectives of the Cassini mission at Saturn were to
            investigate the physical, chemical, and temporal characteristics of Titan
            and of Saturn, its atmosphere, rings, icy satellites, and magnetosphere.
            These are listed more specifically below:
