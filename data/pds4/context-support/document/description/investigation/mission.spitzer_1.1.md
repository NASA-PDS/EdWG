The Spitzer Space Telescope, one of NASA's Great
      Observatories, was a space-based infrared observatory launched in
      August 2003 and managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at Caltech
      and the Spitzer Science Center. Spitzer operated with cryogenically-
      cooled instruments until the last of its helium  boiled away in May
      2009, then proceeded with the Warm Spitzer mission.
