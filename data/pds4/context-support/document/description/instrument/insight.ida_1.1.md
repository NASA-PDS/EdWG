The InSight Instrument Deployment Arm (IDA) has two primary objectives, to point 
            the Instrument Deployment Camera (IDC) for imaging of the terrain surrounding the lander,
            and to deploy the InSight science instruments from the lander deck to the Martian surface. 
            The IDA has a 4-degree-of-freedom back-hoe design, with the IDC mounted on the forearm, 
            a grapple for lifting the science instruments, and a scoop for digging and scraping the 
            Martian regolith.
