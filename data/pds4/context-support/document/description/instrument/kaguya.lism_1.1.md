            The Lunar Imager/SpectroMeter (LISM) consists of three sub-systems: Terrain Camera (TC), 
            Multi-band Imager (MI) and Spectral Profiler (SP). LISM will obtain topographic and 
            mineralogical data of the Moon surface which can be used for mapping of detailed geological 
            units of the Moon surface and identification of materials in each unit.
