    ===================
 
      The instruments for this experiment included a three-axis accelerometer, pressure sensors, and temperature sensors. They 
      were based on the technology demonstrated by the PAET rocket vehicle (Planetary Atmosphere Experiment Test R7106-2001). 
      The measurements were used to construct a profile of atmosphere state properties for the large probe trajectory from the 
      surface to approximately 140 km altitude. They were also used to determine vertical wind velocity, horizontal wind velocity, 
      and turbulence. By comparing atmospheric conditions along the large probe trajectory with those measured by the small probes, 
      circulation models of the atmosphere were determined. The instruments weighed about 2.3 kg and consumed about 4.9 W of power.
