            Bruker IFS 125HR Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectrometer
            In absorption or emission mode, the IFS 125HR can resolve highly complex spectra into discrete lines for 
            recognition and spectral assignment. High resolution across the entire spectrum; resolved linewidths of 
            less than 0.0009 cm-1; broad spectral range: from 5 cm-1 in the far-IR to greater than 50,000 cm-1 in the 
            UV; double-sided interferogram acquisition (option); symmetric line shapes - due to high precision optics;
            easy range change - every experiment can access different sources and detectors without breaking vacuum.
            A total of 4 sources and 6 detectors can be accessed through each of two different sample compartments
            Glide-bearing interferometer with hybrid scanner construction for enhanced velocity stability
            
            The IFS 125HR electronics provides Ethernet connectivity and data acquisition based on the DigitectTM system 
            using 24-bit ADC's integrated with the detector. The standard MIR spectral range can be easily extended to 
            the NIR, visible, or even UV.
