    	This is a generic high speed photometer which uses gallium arsenide (GaAs) as a detector. GaAs 
    	which is a direct band gap semiconductor, is sensitive to the intensity of infrared light. The nominal operating 
    	wavelength range is 865nm to 895nm. A large number of these were produced by several manufacturers and 
    	were in wide use in the last few decades of the 20th century.
