  ===================
    The magnetometer (MISCHA) The prime objective of the magnetometer
    experiment is to determine the role of the magnetic field in the
    interaction between the solar wind and the comet and to identify
    the characteristic boundaries of the cometary environment (bow
    shock, contact surface, etc.).
 
  Instrument Overview
  ===================
    The sensors of the MISCHA magnetometer are mounted on a boom. A
    single-axis sensor and a triaxial sensor are mounted 1 and 2 m,
    respectively, from the edge of the solar panel. The advantage of
    this dual-sensor fluxgate system is the possibility to determine
    the spacecraft's stray magnetic field.
