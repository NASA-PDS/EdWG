 The NEAR magnetometer (MAG) was a fluxgate magnetometer using ring core sensors made of highly 
 magnetically permeable material to detect and map the intrinsic magnetic fields of the 
 asteroid 433 Eros. The primary scientific objectives were to establish the global 
 characteristics and geometry of the magnetic field (internal, remnant, or surface) 
 associated with Eros and any detectable interaction with the solar wind and interplanetary 
 field. Secondary objectives include detection of the bow shock, boundary crossings, and 
 magnetic signatures of surface features.
