            PIXL uses microfocus X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy to measure abundances 
            and sub-millimeter-scale distribution of elements in relation to rock and soil 
            texture and microstructure. PIXL includes a Micro-Context Camera (MCC) to 
            register element distributions to visual features.
