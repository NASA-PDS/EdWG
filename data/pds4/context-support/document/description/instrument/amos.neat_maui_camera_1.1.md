The Near Earth Asteroid Tracking (NEAT) survey began 
observations with the U. S. Air Force 1.0m Ground-based 
Electro-Optical Deep Space Surveillance (GEODSS) 
telescope on Mt. Haleakala, Maui, HI (Pravdo 1999).  In 
2000, NEAT transitioned to the Maui Space Surveillance 
Site (MSSS) 1.2m telescope located at the same facility.  

The NEAT camera at the Maui site was a single 4096 x 4096 
camera with 15 micron pixels.  The pixel scale is 1.43 
arc-sec/pixel with the 1.0m GEODSS telescope and 1.36 
arc-sec/pixel with the MSSS 1.2m.  No filters were used 
and the bandpass is 0.4 - 0.8 microns, however the peak 
response matches closely with the Bessel-type R filter 
at 0.6 microns.  A thermoelectric cooler (TEC) maintained
an approximate operating temperature of -5 and -20 degrees 
C for the GEODSS and MSSS cameras, respectively.  Four 
amplifiers readout the CCD in four quadrants.

The table below provides a comparison of the instrument
and telescope characteristics used by NEAT on Maui, HI.

Regardless of the camera, each CCD chip read to a unique output 
file.  Filenames are based on the universal start time of the 
exposure and, if appropriate, identify the specific chip used.
The Maui and tri-camera images contain the 4080 x 4080 imaging 
area.  The initial orientation of the Maui and Palomar tri-camera 
images has East towards to left and North downward.  Each 
uncompressed, 4k x 4k, image (Palomar tri-camera and Maui) is 
66.6 and 33.3 Mb in size, respectively.
