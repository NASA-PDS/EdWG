            The Sinistro cameras in the Las Cumbres network are 4k x 4k, 15-micron CCD cameras with a 
            26.5 x 26.5 arcminute field of view. Users should note that gain and saturation limits are
            specific to the Sinistro camera (and thus telescope) used to make the observation. Users
            must consult the documentation for the data product to determine which specific telescope 
            was used to record the observation as well as the specific gain and saturation values
            reported.
