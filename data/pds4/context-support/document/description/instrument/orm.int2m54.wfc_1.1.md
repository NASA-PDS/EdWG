The Wide Field Camera (WFC) is an optical mosaic camera for use at the prime focus of
the 2.5m Isaac Newton Telescope (INT).

The text has been adapted from the Isaac Newton Group of Telescopes/Instruments/Wide
Field Camera website.

The WFC consists of 4 thinned EEV 2kx4k CCDs. The CCDs have a pixel size of
13.5microns corresponding to 0.33arcsec/pixel. The edge to edge limit of the mosaic,
neglecting the ~1arcmin inter-chip spacing, is 34.2arcmin. The cycle time for the
whole mosaic is around 42s. 

The CCDs were manufactured in 1998 and have serial numbers:
CCD1 A5506-4; CCD2 A5383-17-7; CCD3 A5530-3; CCD4 A5382-1-7.

The quantum efficiency range at -120C in percent is
61-72 at 380nm, 78-87 at 400nm, 75-86 at 650nm, and 13-16 at 950nm.

The noise ranges from 7.7 to 9.5e (2.8 to 3.6ADU), and the gain ranges from 2.5 to
3.4e/ADU for the fast readout of 29s. 
The noise ranges from 4.3 to 4.8e (2.8 to 3.7ADU), and the gain ranges from 1.2 to
1.7e/ADU for the slow readout of 48s.

WFC is linear within 1% up to 25,000counts and to 2% up to 60,000counts in fast
readout mode.
WFC is linear within 1% up to 40,000counts in slow readout mode.

The dark current ranges from 0.5 to 3.8e/pix/hr depending on the CCD and the measured
temperature of -120C or -110C.

Fringing is at the 5% level in I and 20% in Z.

The cosmic ray count is about 2000counts/hr/chip at sea level.
