 The IRAS Focal Plane Array (FPA) was located at the focal plane of the    
    IRAS Ritchey-Chretien telescope. The focal plane assembly contained the survey detectors, visible          
    star sensors for position reconstruction, a Low Resolution                
    Spectrometer (LRS) and a Chopped Photometric Channel (CPC).
