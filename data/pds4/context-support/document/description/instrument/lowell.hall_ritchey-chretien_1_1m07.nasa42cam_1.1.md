The NASA42 Camera is an imager on the Lowell Observatory Hall 42-inch (1.07m)
telescope.
It is a CCD 4kx4k 15 micron e2v CCD231.
It is most commonly used with 2x2 binning.
The plate scale in 2x2 binned mode is 0.74 arcsec/pixel.
The unvignetted FOV is 25.3 arcmin, while the vignetted (due to the filter size) FOV
is 22 arcmin.
It can be used with 1, 2, or 4 amplifier.
It uses a Cryotiger mechanical cooler.
The gain varies from 4.62 e/DN to 4.82 e/DN, and the noise from 5.3 e to 5.5 e
depending on the amplifier(s) used.
