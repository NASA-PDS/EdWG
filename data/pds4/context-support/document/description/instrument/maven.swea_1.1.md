         The Solar Wind Electron Analyzer (SWEA) is a symmetric, hemispheric electrostatic analyzer
         designed to measure the energy and angular distributions of solar wind electrons and ionospheric
         photoelectrons in the Mars environment. The instrument is a collaboration between the Space 
         Sciences Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley (UCB-SSL) and the Institut de 
         Recherche en Astrophysique et Plan√©tologie (IRAP) in Toulouse, France. SWEA is closely based on 
         two instruments of the same name currently operating on the twin STEREO spacecraft.
