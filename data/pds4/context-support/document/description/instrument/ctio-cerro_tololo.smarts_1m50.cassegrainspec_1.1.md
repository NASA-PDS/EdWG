The CTIO 1.5-meter Cassegrain spectrograph is an ultraviolet transmitting grating
spectrograph which is used at the f/7.5 focus where the scale is 18.1 arcseconds/mm.
It is identical to the 2.1-meter telescope White Cassegrain spectrograph at Kitt Peak
National Observatory and therefore allows one to obtain similar spectrograms in both
hemispheres.
