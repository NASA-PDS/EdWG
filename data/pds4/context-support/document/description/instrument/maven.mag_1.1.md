         The MAVEN particles and fields instrumentation form an ensemble of instruments (“Particles and
         Fields Package”) controlled by a single hardware redundant data processing unit (PFDPU)
         interfacing to the spacecraft. The MAVEN magnetic field investigation (MAG) consists of two
         independent and identical fluxgate magnetometer systems that are interfaced to and controlled by the
         PFDPU. The particles and fields package is a stack of individual electronics boxes that service each
         of the instruments; two of the “slices” are occupied by identical magnetometer electronics boxes that
         service the two magnetometer sensors. Each electronics box is fully shielded and each draws power
         from the redundant power supplies within the PFP.
         
         The magnetometer sensors are located at the very end of the solar array panels on modest extensions
         (.66 m in length) designated as MAG “boomlets”, placing them approximately 5.6 m from the center
         of the spacecraft body.
