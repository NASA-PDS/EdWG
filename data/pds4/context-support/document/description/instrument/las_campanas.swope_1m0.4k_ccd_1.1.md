            Swope 4K CCD is the visible-wavelength, direct-imaging CCD for the Swope 1m Telescope at Las 
            Campanas Observatory. The camera images a 29.7 x 29.8 arc minute field of view at 0.435"/pixel 
            spatial resolution for unbinned 15 micron pixels. The detector is normally read out in a quad 
            amplifier mode writing to four separate FITS files. Facility filters include Harris BVRI and 
            Sloan griz.
