            The BOPPS Infrared Camera (BIRC) is a multispectral IR images designed to 
            measure water and CO2 emissions from comets at 2.73 and 4.3 micrometers,
            respectively, as well as water-related IR absorption features in the 
            2.5-3.2 micrometer range found in asteroids and the Moon.
