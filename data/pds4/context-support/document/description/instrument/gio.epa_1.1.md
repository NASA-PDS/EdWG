      ===================
      The Energetic Particle Experiment (EPA aboard the Giotto spacecraft
      measured the energy distribution of electrons, photons and heavier
      nuclei during the cruise and encounter phases of the mission. The
      detector system consisted of three particle telescopes (T1, T2, T3),
      each incorporating two totally depleted silicon surface barrier layer
      detectors, and employing both active and passive background shielding.
