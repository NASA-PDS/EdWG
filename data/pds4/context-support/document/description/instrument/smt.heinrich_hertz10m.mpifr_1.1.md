The Submillimeter Telescope (SMT) Max Planck Institute fur Radioastronomie (MPIfR)
19-channel bolometer was developed at MPIfR Bonn by E. Kresya and collaborators.  It
was in use at the Heinrich Hertz Submillimeter Telescope (SMT) until it was
decommissioned sometime after mid-2004.  The 19 channels of the array are arranged in
two concentric hexagons around the central channel.  The azimuth distance between two
adjacent channels is about 50 arcsec and the maximum beam separation is about 200
arcsec.

The bandpass of the bolometer (delta nu over nu) is approximately 0.15.  The
sensitivity extends from 310 to 380 GHz with peak sensitivity at 340-345 GHz.  The
beam size at this frequency is 23 arcseconds.

In the submillimeter range, most of the noise is due to the atmosphere.  With proper
data reduction, the atmospheric noise can be eliminated to a certain degree.  The
remaining noise level is about 600 mJy / sqrt(sec) per channel.
