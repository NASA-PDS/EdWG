      Instrument Overview
      ===================
      The Johnstone Plasma Analyzer (JPA) was designed to measure the
      three-dimensional energy distribution of positive ions to study
      the interaction between the solar wind and ionised cometary
      particles.  The two sensors measure the distribution from 10 eV
      ro 20 eV once per spacecraft spin and the distribution from
      90 eV to 90 keV, with coars mass discriminations, once every
      32 spins.
 
      For complete details and discussion of the instrument design and
      operation, see the instrumentaton article of ESA SP-1077, reprinted
      as part of the documentation in Giotto Extended Mission archive.
