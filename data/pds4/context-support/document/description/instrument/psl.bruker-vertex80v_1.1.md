            Reflectance measurements were acquired with a Bruker Vertex80V FTIR spectrometer with a Bruker A513 unit that 
            enabled bidirectional reflectance measurements. The instrument was under vacuum at a pressure of 0.7 mbar and all 
            measurements were done at ambient temperature. The incidence, emission, and phase angles were 30ยบ, 0ยบ, and 30ยบ, 
            respectively. The measurements were acquired over the total spectral range of 0.2 to 25 um. The MIR (which 
            actually extends shortward into the NIR) covers the spectral range from 1.0 to 20 um. The samples were measured, 
            through a 0.25 mm aperture, using a spectrometer housing a mercury-cadmium-telluride (MCT) detector and a KBr 
            beamsplitter. The samples were illuminated with an external, water-cooled Globar. The output "MIR" reflectance 
            spectrum was an average of 500 scans (at 2 cm-1 spectral sampling) calibrated to an Infragold diffuse reflectance 
            target.
