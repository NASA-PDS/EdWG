    ===================
 
      This experiment consisted of a nephelometer to measure the energy backscattered from cloud particles. It used a 
      pulsed gallium arsenide laser diode to illuminate the clouds. The altitude history of the backscattered signal 
      indicated the presence and vertical extent of clouds along the trajectory. Comparisons with the measurements from 
      the small probes indicated the spatial variability of the cloud structure. The laser operated at about 9000 A. 
      The experiment weighed about 0.5 kg and used about 1.3 W of power.
