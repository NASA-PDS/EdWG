        ===================                                             
        The Cometary Sampling and Composition Experiment (COSAC) is part
        of the Rosetta instrument payload.  It is one of the evolved gas
        analysers of the Lander space-craft Philae. It provides data on 
        the volatile fraction and its nature of the nucleus of comet    
        67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.                                      
                                                                        
                                                                        
        Scientific Objectives                                           
        =====================                                           
        The goal of COSAC is the identification of volatile molecular   
        species in the cometary nucleus.

        ===========                                                     
        The calibration of the instrument is an ongoing process and the 
        results are incorporated in the EGSE software.

        COSAC comprises two instruments: a gas-chromatograph (GC) with  
        eight different columns each equipped with a thermal            
        conductivity detector and a time-of-flight mass-spectrometer    
        (MS) with a multi-sphere-plate as detector. More details are    
        found in Goesmann et.al, 2005

        Details on the electronics of the instrument are described in   
        Goesmann, et.al, 2005.                                          
                                                                        
        Location                                                        
        ========                                                        
        COSAC is mounted on the large Pi-plate in the warm compartment  
        of Philae.  Samples are delivered by the Sample Drilling and    
        Distribution unit (SD2) to ovens located on the balcony of      
        Philae.                                                         
                                                                        
        Operational Modes                                               
        =================                                               
        COSAC can be operated in basically three different modes: GC    
        mode; only the GC is used, MS mode; only the MS is used, or     
        coupled mode where the GC exhaust is fed into the MS.  All three
        modes may be run with samples from different sources like       
        atmosphere, oven, enrichment capsule, or calibration gas.       
                                                                        
        Subsystems                                                      
        ==========                                                      
        The sub-systems are described in Goesmann et al, 2005.          
                                                                        
                                                                        
        Measured Parameters                                             
        ===================                                             
        The COSAC GC measures the retention times of molecular species  
        in separation columns, the COSAC MS measures the time-of-flight 
        of ionised fragments of molecular species.
