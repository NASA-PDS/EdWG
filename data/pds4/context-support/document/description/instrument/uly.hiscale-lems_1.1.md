  ===================
    (adapted from: Lanzerotti, et al. 1992)
 
 The are Low-Energy Magnetic Spectrometers (LEMS)
 provide pulse-height-analyzed single-detector measurements
 with active anticoincidence. The foil thickness, detector 
 thicknesses, and electronic thresholds were selected to 
 enable the separation of low energy electron and ion 
 fluxes at high sensitivity by comparing detector responses.
 
 The individual LEMS telescopes are referred to as LEMS 30, 
 and LEMS 120, where the number indicates the inclination of 
 the telescope axis with respect to the spacecraft spin axis.
 The MF, M' F', and BC detector pairs (Tab. 1) are
 identical (for ease of replacement pre-flight); each consists
 of two equal 200 micrometer thick, totally depleted silicon surface
 barrier detectors. 
 
 The orientations  of the telescope axes are such that there is
 nearly a complete 41r coverage of the unit sphere during
 one complete spacecraft spin. 
 
 In the LEMS 30 and 120 telescopes, electrons with
 energies below ~300 keV are swept away from detectors
 M and M' by a rare-earth magnet. The geometric factor
 for the ions measured by detectors M and M' is ~ 0.48
 cm2sr. The ion energy channels are listed in Table 1 (the
 energy channels for both LEMS telescopes are essentially
 identical).
 
 In the LEMS 30 telescope, the magnetically-deflected
 electrons are counted by a separate detector B, with a
 geometrical factor of ~0.05 cm2sr. The electron energy
 channels for B with their defining logic are shown in
 Table 1. Two-dimensional particle ray tracing in a magnetic
 field similar to that of LEMS 30 is shown in Figure
 7. -Such two-dimensional (and similar three-dimensional)
 computer ray-tracing studies have been used together with
 calibration data obtained with a particle accelerator to
 determine the effective field-of-view of the telescope aperture.
