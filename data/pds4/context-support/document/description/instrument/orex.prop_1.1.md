            Propulsion is provided by a pressurized mono-propellant system based on ultrapure hydrazine. The
            system includes a main propellant tank, a helium pressurant tank, four 200-N main thrusters for the
            largest maneuvers, six 22-N thrusters for trajectory corrections, sixteen 4.5-N thrusters for
            attitude control, and two 0.5-N thrusters for precise maneuvers needed prior to departure from
            Bennu orbit and for touch-and-go sample acquisition. Thruster activity is recorded for transmission
            to Earth in the spacecraft engineering data stream.
