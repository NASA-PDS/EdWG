            VIRTIS on Venus Express was a hyperspectral
            imager repurposed from the flight spare of the instrument of the same name of the Rosetta mission
            [Coradini et al., 1998]. It combines a scanning mirror with a refraction grating to disperse the
            light from a narrow slit across a detector array. VIRTIS data are organized as cubes with one 
            spectral dimension (bands) and two spatial dimensions, which are along the direction of the slit 
            (samples) and along the direction of the scanning mirror (line).
