      The Goldstone Solar System Radar (GSSR) transmits 450 kW and can range-code the transmitted
      signal at up to 40 MHz bandwidth for a range resolution of 25 ns or 3.75 m.  The transmit
      frequency is 8560 MHz (3.5 cm).  The GSSR transmitter can also be phase, frequency, and
      amplitude modulated.  GSSR is fully steerable and can view the entire sky north
      of declination = -35 degrees. Until 2010, X-band transmissions could be modulated at
      8 MHz for 18.75 meter resolution.
