            The Arecibo Planetary Radar Receiver is a single-pixel
            cryogenically-cooled High Electron Mobility Transistor (HEMT) amplifier
            mounted on the Arecibo 305-m telescope. It has a filter bandpass of
            approximately 100 MHz centered at 2380 MHz to best match the bandpass
            of the Arecibo Planetary Radar Transmitter. Earlier implementations of
            the Arecibo Planetary Radar Receiver had similar properties but somewhat
            varying performance.
