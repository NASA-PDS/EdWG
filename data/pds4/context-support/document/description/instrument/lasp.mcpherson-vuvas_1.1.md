            Reflectance measurements acquired at LASP were conducted using a customized f/4.5 modified Seya-Namioka 
            scanning-grating monochromator (McPherson, Inc. model 234/302) Vacuum UltraViolet Analytical Spectrophotometer 
            (VUVAS). Data for this work were acquired over the spectral range of far-UV into the visible (VIS) range (usable 
            from 0.12 to 0.6 um; 120 to 600 nm) with a spectral sampling interval of 2 nm (4 nm spectral resolution). The 
            incidence, emission, and phase angles were 30ยบ, 0ยบ, and 30ยบ, respectively. The sample cup was 1.9 cm in 
            diameter, and 0.6 cm deep.  Each complete CU spectrum is a composite of four spectra obtained within the 
            narrower, overlapping ranges of 120-240 nm, 210-320 nm, 290-400 nm, and 360-600 nm, under vacuum conditions. 
            This strategy is required due to large variations in lamp brightness and instrument sensitivity, necessitating 
            optimization of the photomultiplier tube (PMT) high voltage (HV) in each range. The lamp was either a 30 W 
            deuterium (D2) lamp or a 100 W quartz-tungsten-halogen (QTH) lamp. A choice of two gratings with different 
            ruling densities, spectral coverage, and dispersion was selected. The detector was a tilted scintillator (sodium 
            salicylate) plate coupled to a reflective light pipe, feeding a photomultiplier tube (PMT) that was located 
            outside the chamber.
