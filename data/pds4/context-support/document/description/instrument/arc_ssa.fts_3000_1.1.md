Instrument Overview
===================
This laboratory spectrometer is capable of collecting fourier transform spectra from
0.9 to 22 micrometers (11000-450 1/cm) using a combination of MCT (Mercury Cadmium
Telluride) and DTGS (deuterated triglycine sulfate) detectors and KBr (Potassium
Bromide) and quartz beamsplitters with a minimum spectral resolution of 0.5 1/cm.
