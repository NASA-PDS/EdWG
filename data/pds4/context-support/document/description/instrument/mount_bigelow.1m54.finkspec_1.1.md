The following description is excerpted from Fink et al. 1980. [FINKETAL1980].

The Fink Spectrograph was built at the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory and was
designed to make optimum use of the CCD array.  It employed a transmission grating
and had a spectral range of 5700-11000 Angstroms and a maximum first order resolution
of 11 Angstroms.  The long-wavelength limit was determined by the CCD sensitivity
cutoff and in practice was close to 1.06 microns.  The short-wavelength limit
followed the sharp cutoff of a Schott OG 570 filter which eliminated overlapping
orders.

The CCD was manufactured by Texas Instruments and contained 500x500 elements, each
being 15.2 microns square.  During its operation it was cooled to ~120 degrees C to
minimize dark noise.  The detector and associated electronics were part of a
ground-based system built at the California Institute of Technology for use by the
Space Telescope Wide Field Planetary Camera investigation definition team.
