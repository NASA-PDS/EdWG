    ===================
 
      The objective of this experiment was to determine the composition of Venus' lower atmosphere. From these measurements, 
      deductions were made of the gaseous sources of infrared opacity, the degree of differentiation of Venus' interior, the 
      degree of similarity between the solid bodies of earth and Venus, and evolution of Venus' atmosphere. Two gas 
      chromatograph columns were used to analyze samples of the atmosphere during probe descent.
