            The Spectral cameras in the Las Cumbres network are 4k x 4k, 15-micron CCD cameras with a 10.5 arcminute 
            field of view. Note that there are special considerations related to reducing images taken with the 
            Spectral camera mounted on the Faulkes Telescope North (FTN) located at Haleakala Observatory. Consult
            the data documentation to determine which telescope was used to obtain the observation when that 
            information is needed, and for details of data reduction applied.
