            The VLT spectrometer and imager for the mid-infrared (VISIR) was built by CEA/DAPNIA/SAP and NFRA/ASTRON, 
            and is located at the Cassegrain focus of UT3 (Melipal). It provides diffraction-limited imaging at high 
            sensitivity in three mid-infrared (MIR) atmospheric windows: the M-band at 5µm, the N-band between 8 to 13μm 
            and the Q band between 17 and 20μm, respectively. In addition, it features a long-slitspectrometer with a 
            range of spectral resolutions between 150 and 30000.
