    ===================
      The plasma-wave investigation measures fluctuating
      electric and magnetic fields associated with waves
      above the ion cyclotron frequency (1 - 100000 Hz).
      Spectral analysis is performed on signals from
      three detectors: a pair of long electric-field
      antennas, a short electric-field sensor and a
      search coil, both of which are mounted on one of
      the experiment booms (Fig. 6).  Electric-field
      fluctuations between 20 and 100000 Hz are measured
      in 16 frequency channels once per second at 1024
      bit/s.  Cometary dust particles hitting the
      spacecraft or the electric antennas caused
      detectable outputs similar to those detected when
      Voyager passed through Saturn's ring-plane.
