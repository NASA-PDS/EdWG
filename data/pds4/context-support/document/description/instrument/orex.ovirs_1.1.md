The OSIRIS Visible and near-IR Spectrometer (OVIRS) is a point spectrometer with a 4-mrad field of view (FOV)
         that provides spectra over the wavelength range of 0.4 – 4.3 μm to map the visible and near infrared characteristics of 
         the surface of the asteroid (101955) Bennu. It employs wedged filters (also called a linear variable filter) to provide 
         the spectrum. A wedged filter is a two-dimensional spectral filter in which the wavelength of transmitted light varies in 
         a well-defined fashion with position along one of the spatial dimensions.
