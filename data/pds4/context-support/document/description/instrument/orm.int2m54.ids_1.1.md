The IDS of the 2.5m Isaac Newton Telescope is a long-slit spectrograph. Two 4096x2048
CCD detectors are available, the red-sensitive RED+2 and blue-sensitive EEV10. 16
gratings are also available. Possible grating and CCD combinations  allow dispersions
between 0.24 and 4 Ã… per pixel. The spatial scale is 0.4 and 0.44 arcsec per pixel
for EEV10 and RED+2 detector, respectively. The full unvignetted slit length is 3.3
arcmin.
