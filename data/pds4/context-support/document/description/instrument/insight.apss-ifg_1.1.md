 The InSight Fluxgate Magnetometer (IFG) is a triaxial fluxgate magnetometer with
         three orthogonal sensors capable of measuring magnetic fields up to 20,000 nT. IFG is part
         of the InSight Auxilary Payload Sensor System (APSS), designed to support the seismic
         experiment, and is not primarily a science instrument.
