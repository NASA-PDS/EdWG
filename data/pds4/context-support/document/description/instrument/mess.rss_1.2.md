          The telecommunications system uses an X-band transponder on the spacecraft and
          transmitters and receivers at stations of the NASA Deep Space Network on Earth.
          Range and Doppler measurements made during communcations sessions can be used to
          determine the spacecraft trajectory; from the trajectory, Mercury's gravity field
          can be inferred.  Measurements of occultation times can be used to obtain the
          planet's radius at the occultation points, refining the planet's shape model.
