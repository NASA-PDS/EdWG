            The ancillary autoguider cameras for the main visible-wavelength,
            direct-imaging CCD Sinistro instruments for the Las Cumbres
            Observatory (LCOGT) 1-meter Telescopes are called the FLI Imagers.
            The FLI imagers compromise a Finger Lakes Instrumentation (FLI) ML4720 
            camera containing a e2v back-illuminated monolithic frame transfer CCD with 
            1024 x 1024 x 13um pixels combined with a LCOGT constructed corrector, focus
            stage and filterwheel. The instrument is mounted on one of the
            side ports on the LCOGT 1-meter instrument support structure.
