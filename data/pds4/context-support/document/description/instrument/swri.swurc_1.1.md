            The Southwest Ultraviolet Reflectance Chamber (abbreviated SwURC) is an ultra-high vacuum chamber containing a goniometer-mounted far-ultraviolet (FUV) detector assembly. A 
            unique feature of this instrumentation suite is the use of a retractable sample tray, allowing for absolute bi-directional reflectance measurements of lunar soils and simulants. 
            A McPherson 234-302 FUV monochromator coupled to a 30-Watt deuterium lamp provides illumination of the sample at 45 degrees incidence and at wavelengths between 115 nm and 200 nm. 
            Use of a 5901 Magnum Spiraltron channel electron multiplier detector ensures the extended dynamic range needed for absolute bi-directional reflectance measurements.
