The Apollo 17 Lunar Surface Gravimeter (LSG) Experiment was intended to make highly accurate measurements of the lunar surface gravitational acceleration and its temporal variations at a selected point on the surface, about 8 meters from the ALSEP central station. One of its specific objectives was monitoring of free oscillations of the moon that may be induced by gravitational radiation from cosmic sources.
