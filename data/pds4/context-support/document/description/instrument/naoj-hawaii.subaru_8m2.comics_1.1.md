            COMICS is a mid-infrared camera and spectrometer with the ability to study cool interstellar
            dust, galaxies and active galactic nuclei, protoplanetary/planetary applications mounts on the 
            Cassegrain focus of the Subaru 8.2 m telecope at the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan
            on Mauna Kea, in Hawai'i. The instrument measures 2 m x 2 m x 2m and weighs 2 t. COMICS operates
            in the wavelength range 7.5 - 25 µm and is optimized for use in the N-band (7.5 - 13.5 µm) and Q-
            band (16 - 25 µm). The detectors used are 6 320-pixel by 240-pixel Si:As BIB detectors: 1 for 
            imaging/slit viewing (40" slit length) and 5 arrays for spectroscopy, which provide high sensitivity,
            high spatial resolution, and observational efficiency. The field of view (FOV) is 42 arcsec x 32 arcsec
            for imaging, with a pixel size of 50 µm. Pixel scale is 0.13 arcsec (imaging) or 0.165 arcsec
            (spectroscopy), which translates into specrtral resolution of 250-10,000 in N-band and 2,500 in Q-band.
