The Narrow Angle (NAC) camera had Schmidt-Cassegrain reflector optics without filters. 
        The narrow angle f/2.4 lens had a focal length of about 504 mm. The optics focused images onto a
        vidicon to obtain images of Mars. The vidicon was etched with a 7 x 9 grid of reseaux to aid in 
        computing the geometric distortions in the digital images. The NAC produced 945 sample by 704 line, 
        8 bit/pixel digital images after ground processing to produce the image archive.
