  ===================
    The Spatial Infrared Imaging Telescope (SPIRIT III) was a 33cm
    clear-aperture off-axis telecope that contained two focal-plane
    instruments:  a multispectral high spatial resolution (18')
    radiometer and a six-channel high spectral resolution (R~20cm-1),
    2.5 to 28 micron Fourier transform spectrometer.  The radiometer
    had four broad spectral bands (A, C, D, and E) and two narrow
    bands (B1 and B2).  Detector pixels were square with a pixel
    scale of 18.3 arcsec/pixel.

    SPIRIT III flew on the Midcourse Space Experiment (MSX) satellite
    which was launched in April 1996, and operated until February 1997
    when it ran out of cryogen.
