            A large and complex wind tunnel used at the Shapotou Desert Experimental Research Station, China. The overall length of the tunnel 
            is 37 m. The working section dimentions are 21 m length, 1.2 m width, 1.2 m height. The tunnel is subdived into several sections
            including the power section (2.60 m length), expansion section (6.40 m length), stabilization section (honeycomb and drag screens,
            1.50 m length), compression section (2.50 m length), work section (21.0 m length), and the diffusion section (3.00 m length).
            The cross-sectional area varies by section and reaches a maximum in the expansion section at 2.4 m by 1.2 m. Wind speed can be 
            continuously varied from 2 - 30 m s^-1.
