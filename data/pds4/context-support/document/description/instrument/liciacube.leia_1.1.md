            The Liciacube Explorer Imaging for Asteroid (LEIA) instrument is one of two imagers on the 
            Italian Space Agency's (ASI) Light Italian Cubesat for Imaging of Asteroids (LICIACube) 
            satellite. LEIA is composed by a catadioptric telescopic camera with 2 reflective and 
            3 refractive elements. The Field of View (FoV) is equal to ± 2.06° on the sensor diagonal 
            (i.e., 2.9° on both the horizontal and vertical axis). The detector is a CMOS sensor (CMV4000) 
            with 2048x2048 pixel.
