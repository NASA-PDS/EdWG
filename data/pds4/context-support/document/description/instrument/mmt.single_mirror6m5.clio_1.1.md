            The Clio camera and spectrograph incorporates an InSb 9809 ROIC 256 x
            320 array of 30-micron pixels. The camera used a low-resolution direct
            vision prism with the 10 arcsecond slit to produce spectra from 
            ~ 2.5 - 4.5 microns. Due to the optical nature of the prism, the 
            resolving power is not linear with respect to wavelength, thus resolution
            will vary with wavelength. The filter and prism are internal to the Clio
            instrument.
