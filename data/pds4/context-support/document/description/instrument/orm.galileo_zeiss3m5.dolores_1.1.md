DOLORES (Device Optimized for LOw RESolution) is a focal reducer instrument installed
at the Nasmyth B focus of the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo at La Palma. The detector
is a 2048 x 2048 E2V 4240 thinned back-illuminated, deep-depleted, Astro-BB coated
CCD with a pixel size of 13.5 microns. The scale is 0.252 arcsec/pixel which yields a
field of view of about  8.6 x 8.6 arcmin. The instrument allows imaging through broad
and narrow band filters as well as spectroscopic observations with resolving powers
between RS = ~500 and RS = ~6000. A multi-slit mode, based on custom masks
manufactured by a dedicate cutting machine, is also available.

Notes:

1.  The LR-R Grism has a built-in order-blocking filter cutting blueward
~5000 angstroms; nevertheless, blue objects will show noticeable second-order
overlap above ~9500 angstroms.
2.  The V390 Grism is not mounted on the grism wheel and may be used ONLY in
visitor mode. Users interested in using this grism must explicitly request
it in the Observing Proposal.
3.  The V860, VHRR, and VHRI Grisms suffer from significant second-order
effect and will be automatically coupled  with the ~560 nm cut-on filter
available on the filters wheel.
4.  Resolution calculated for a 1" Slit.
5.  Please note that there aren't suitable wavelength calibration lamps for
the V486 GRISM.
