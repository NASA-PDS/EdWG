 The NEAR GRS is part of the X-Ray/Gamma-Ray Spectrometer (XGRS) suite on the NEAR mission.
 It detects characteristic gamma rays in the 0.3- to 10-MeV range that are emitted from 
 specific elements in the surface. Some of these emissions are excited by cosmic rays and 
 some arise from natural radioactivity in the asteroid. The GRS uses a body-mounted    
 passively cooled NaI scintillator detector with a bismuth germanate anticoincidence shield 
 that defines a 45 FOV, with an objective of measuring abundances of several important 
 elements such as K, Si, and Fe in four quadrants of the asteroid.
