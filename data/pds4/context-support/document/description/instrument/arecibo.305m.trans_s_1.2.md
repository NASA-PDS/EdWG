	    The Arecibo Planetary Radar Transmitter transmitted 1 MW continuous output power at
	    2380 MHz with a 27 MHz bandwidth (1 dB). When transmitting through the Arecibo
	    Telescope, the peak Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) was approximately 20
	    TW. It could be phase, frequency, and amplitude modulated. Between 1974 and 1997 the
	    peak output power was 450 kW, or 7 TW EIRP.  Before 1997, the telescope gain, and
	    thus EIRP, depended significantly on telescope pointing, as the illuminated area of
	    the reflector was reduced at zenith angles above 10 degrees.
