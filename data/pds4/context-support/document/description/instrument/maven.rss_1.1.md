                   In two-way mode a DSN ground station transmits an uplink carrier at about 
                   7.2 GHz, referenced to the local frequency and timing standard (FTS), which 
                   ensures greatest stability.  The uplink signal is received at the spacecraft; 
                   there are small phase changes in the signal if it has passed through the 
                   atmosphere/ionosphere of Mars.  The spacecraft telecommunication subsystem 
                   locks to the uplink signal and echoes it back at about 8.4 GHz.  Additional 
                   phase changes are imposed if the downlink signal passes through Mars 
                   atmosphere/ionosphere.  The downlink signal is received by the DSN ground 
                   station using its open-loop Radio Science Receiver, which is referenced to 
                   the FTS.
