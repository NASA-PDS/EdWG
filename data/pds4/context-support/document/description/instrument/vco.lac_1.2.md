            Lightning and Airglow Camera (LAC) searches for lightning flashes and maps airglow
            emissions on the nightside disk of Venus when Akatsuki is located in the eclipse (umbra)
            of Venus. A major goal of the lightning observation is to settle the controversy
            on the occurrence of lightning in the Venusian atmosphere. The distribution of lightning,
            if it exists, should reflect the microphysics of clouds and the dynamics of mesoscale
            convection. The 777.4 nm [OI] line of atomic oxygen is utilized for lightning observation,
            as this line is considered the strongest emission from lightning discharges according to
            a laboratory experiment simulating the Venusian atmosphere. Possible lightning flashes
            were detected on the nightside disk of Venus at this wavelength by using a ground-based
            telescope.

            LAC also measures emissions in two airglow bands to study the global-scale circulation
            and small-scale waves in the lower thermosphere. One is the O2 Herzberg II emission
            centered at 552.5 nm wavelength, which is considered a consequence of the recombination
            of atomic oxygen in downwelling and is the strongest emission among the visible Venusian
            airglows. The other is the 557.7 nm [OI] emission; though Venera 9 and 10 failed to
            detect this emission it was observed using a ground-based telescope.
