The Crimean Astrophysical Observatory (CrAO) Five-Channel Photopolarimeter is capable
of simultaneous polarimetric measurements in UBVRI colors, with four dichroic filters
splitting the optical paths of the UBVRI components of white light in such a way as
to feed five separate photomultipliers that measure each color simultaneously.  A
half-wave plate in front of a calcite block splits the incoming radiation into two
components with polarization planes mutually orthogonal to each other.  Rotation of
the half-wave plate by steps of 45 degrees and corresponding measurements of the
intensities of the two rays allow the observer to derive the values of the Stokes
parameters and hence the value of the degree of linear polarization and the position
angle. The construction of the polarimeter allows a direct elimination of the sky
background polarization.
