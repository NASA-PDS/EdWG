Imager on the 31-in (0.79m) NURO telescope.

The following text has been adapted from the NURO NAU website.

Lowell's NASAcam was built by Dr. Ted Dunham using a 2Kx2K Loral CCD. The camera is
thermoelectrically cooled. It uses a 2:1 focal reducer, which gives a plate scale of
0.456"/pixel with an approximate field of view of 17 arcmin per side at the NURO
telescope. There are a couple of bad columns, and the rows at the south edge of the
field need to be trimmed off. The trimmed FOV is 17.5 arcmin East-West and 16.4
arcmin North-South. The gain is 2.1 e/ADU and the readnoise is 6.2 e.
