The Mosaic Imager features eight 2048 (serial or pixels/row) x 4096 (parallel or
pixels/column) 15 micron pixel CCDs arranged as an 8192 x 8192 pixel detector.  At
the KPNO 4-m, where the pixels are 0.26 arcsec on the sky, this provides a field of
view of 36 arcmin on a side. Pictures are 135 Mbytes each. 

The gaps between CCDs are about 0.7 mm in the row direction and 0.5 mm in the column
direction.  The Mosaic Imager is populated with thinned, AR coated SITe CCDs. These
chips have only minor flaws that have little effect on their scientific performance,
but they do require careful calibration to attain excellent flat-fielded images.
