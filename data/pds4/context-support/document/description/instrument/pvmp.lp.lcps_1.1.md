    ===================
 
      The objective of this experiment was to measure Venus' cloud particle sizes and concentrations. A laser was used to illuminate 
      cloud particles. Optical lenses imaged the particle shadows on arrays of detectors. The particle shadows were used to determine 
      particle size and concentration. The flight sensor was similar to those flown in aircraft and balloons.
