  ===================
 
    Images for the Mars analog hand-lens-scale image data base were
    acquired with a Canon Rebel XT, a digital SLR (single lens reflex)
    camera with an 8.0 Mpxl sensor. For images taken at microscale-resolution
    (10 micrometer/pixel), a 100mm f/2.8 macro lens was threaded
    into the lens adaptor and a twin-tube ring light was mounted on the
    extended lens to assure uniform illumination. A tripod with a three-way
    head provided stability during high-resolution imaging. The same camera
    was used to take context images at a variety of resolutions.
