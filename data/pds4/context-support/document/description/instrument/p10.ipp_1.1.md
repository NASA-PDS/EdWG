        The Imaging Photopolarimeter (IPP) for Pioneer 10 operated in 3 modes, with their 
        main difference being in their sensitivity and instantaneous field of view.
        
        The most sensitive mode was not used at encounter. It was used during the 
        mission's interplanetary phase to measure the integrated starlight from the Galaxy,
        the Zodiacal Light, and Gegenschein (also called counterglow).
        
        The photometric and polarimetric modes obtained data on Jupiter over a wide range 
        of phase angles and distances. These data provided new knowledge about the size, 
        shape, and refractive index of cloud particles, as well as the gas abundance 
        above the clouds. 
        
        The photometric mode also produced data that were digitally processed into images 
        of Jupiter. The spin of the spacecraft swept a small telescope across the planet 
        in narrow 0.03 degree wide strips, viewing the planet in red and blue light.
        A visual image of the planet was built up through the processing of these strips.
