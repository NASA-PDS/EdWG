The InfraRed Spectrograph (IRS) was an instrument
      onboard the Spitzer Space Telescope. It could obtain low-resolution,
      long slit spectra (R~60-130) from 5.2-38.0 microns and high-
      resolution spectra (R~600) in Echelle mode from 9.9-37.2 microns.
      The spectrograph consisted of four modules, each of which was built
      around a 128x128 pixel array.
