            ECAM is comprised of nine (9) camera imaging systems that aid the rover in
            navigating the Martian terrain and avoiding obstacles therein.  Additionally,
            a CacheCam is used to verify the collection of surface samples acquired
            during the mission.
            The full complement of instruments and cameras contained within the
            Engineering Camera Suite are:
            (1) HazCam: Hazard Avoidance Cameras (six (6) cameras total)
                (a) two front-facing stereo pairs
                (b) one rear-facing stereo pair
            (2) NavCam: Navigation Cameras (one stereo pair mounted to the rover mast)
