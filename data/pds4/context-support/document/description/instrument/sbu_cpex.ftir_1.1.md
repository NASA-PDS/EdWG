            The fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra for this project were obtained by the Center for 
            Planetary Exploration at Stony Brook University using a Nicolet iN10MX FTIR microscope. 
            Micro-FTIR hyperspectral maps of thin sections were acquired using a liquid nitrogen-cooled 
            HgCdTe (MCT) detector, generating hyperspectral image cubes between 7,000 and 715 cm^-1 
            (1.4–14.0 μm) at 25 μm/pixel and 8 cm^-1 spectral sampling. Spectra were normalized to 100% 
            maximum reflectance for ease of comparison. Point spectra were acquired with a deuterated 
            triglycine sulfate (DTGS) detector, with a spectral range of 400–4,000 cm^-1 (2.5–25 μm). 
            For these analyses, we chose a spot size of 100 × 100 μm representing a single spot within 
            the grain, with spectral sampling of 8 cm^-1. Each spectrum represented accumulations of 1,024 
            scans. For both point spectra and hyperspectral maps, backgrounds were collected on gold mirrors 
            prior to measuring the sample. Background analyses used the same spot size and acquisition times 
            as samples.
