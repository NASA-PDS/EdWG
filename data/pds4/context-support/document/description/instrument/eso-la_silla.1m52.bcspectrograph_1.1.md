The Boller & Chivens spectrograph at the ESO 1.52m has been equipped with a special
dioptric camera for use with the f/15 Cassegrain focus.  An order blocking filter
assembly is located below the slit jaws to prevent overlapping of unwanted spectral
orders. It may hold up to four filters.  No deckers are used for observation.  The
opto-mechanical configuration allows for a fixed angle between the incident and
diffracted beam axis of the grating (configuration angle). The grating is mounted in
an adjustable rotating cell that permits the choice of the central wavelength and
spectral orders (grating angle).  The dioptric camera has an efficiency of ~87%
between 430 nm and 900 nm and > 78% for wavelengths < 430 nm.  The slit assembly
consists of two 64mm long polished and aluminized jaws on which the field of view can
be seen by the guiding camera. The slit-width is remotely controlled from the
observing console in the control room.  The slit length is 4.5 arcmin and the scale
in the spatial direction is 0.82 arcsec/px.

Note:  This instrument has been decommissioned in 2002.
