The Wide Angle Camera (WAC) had Zeiss refractor optics with a shutter that incorporated 
        four spectral filters in a rotary wheel in the order red, green, blue and green again. The wide 
        angle f/5.6 lens had a focal length of about 52.5 mm. The optics focused images onto a vidicon to 
        obtain images of Mars. The vidicon was etched with a 7 x 9 grid of reseaux to aid in computing the 
        geometric distortions in the digital images. The WAC produced 945 sample by 704 line, 8 bit/pixel 
        digital images after ground processing to produce the image archive.
