            T-ReCS (Thermal-Region Camera Spectrograph) is a mid-infrared imager and long-slit spectrograph built by the 
            University of Florida for Gemini South. In 2003B, the imaging and low resolution spectroscopic modes of the 
            instrument were commissioned. The commissioning of the medium resolution N-band spectroscopy mode (a.k.a. 
            "Hi-Res" mode) followered in 2004B. These modes are now available for general use.
            
            The instrument design is intended to be relatively simple and optimized for low thermal background, high throughput,
            and excellent image quality to take advantage of the high thermal-infrared performance of the Gemini telescopes. 
            T-ReCS, when combined with Gemini's fast tip/tilt compensating secondary mirror, will yield nearly diffraction-limited 
            10 Âµm images under most natural seeing conditions.
            
            The Instrument Scientist for T-ReCS is James Radomski.
