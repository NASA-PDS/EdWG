The Goodman High Throughput Spectrograph (GTHS) was built in the Goodman Laboratory
at the University of North Carolina under the leadership of Prof. J. Christopher
Clemens. It is an imaging spectrograph, capable of producing excellent image quality
across a 7.2 arcmin diameter FOV (with a 0.15 arcsec/pixel scale), and spectra at
various resolutions from the atmospheric UV cutoff all the way out to 850nm. It
employs all transmissive optics, and Volume Phase Holographic (VPH) Gratings to
achieve the highest possible throughput for low resolution spectroscopy over the
320-850 nm wavelength range. The paper describing the instrument is Clemens et al.
(2004). 

In spectroscopic mode the Goodman Spectrograph can obtain both single, longslit
spectra and spectra of multiple objects simultaneously over a field of 3.0 x 5.0
arcminutes using multi-slit masks. A carousel style mask changer, holding up to 36
masks allows the slit plates to be interchanged and located at the instrument
entrance aperture.

In imaging mode the plate scale is 0.15 arcsec/pixel and the field of view is 7.2
arcmin in diameter (3096 x 3096 unbinned pixels).
