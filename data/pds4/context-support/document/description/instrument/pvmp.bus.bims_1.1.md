    ===================
 
      This ion mass spectrometer experiment obtained measurements which provided information on the 
      solar wind interaction with Venus, upper atmosphere photochemistry, and the mass and heat 
      transport characteristics of the atmosphere. A Bennett ion spectrometer, similar to units 
      flown on many earth satellites and rockets, measured Venus' upper atmosphere ion concentrations 
      in the mass range from 1 to 60 atomic mass units (u) from the time of crossing Venus' bowshock 
      to bus burnup.
