 
  Instrument Overview
  ===================
 
  The LCROSS visible camera (VIS) is a ruggedized NTSC color video
  camera from the RocketCam(TM) camera family developed by Ecliptic
  Enterprises, Inc.  The unit consists of a camera module and a
  lens.  The camera's focal plane CCD sensor is 752 [H] x 582 [V]
  pixel format, operating at 30 Hz (60 Fields/Sec).
 
  The flight unit's lens is a 12 mm (focal length), f/1.2 lens
  providing a 30.1 deg [H] x 22.8 deg [V] (37.6 deg [Diagonal])
  field-of-view.
 
  Interlaced NTSC fields are sampled by the Data Handling Unit (DHU)
  at 720 x 243 resolution resulting in a final image resolution of
  720 x 486 pixels.
 
  Each pixel is 24-bit RGB with 8 bits per color channel.  These
  images are compressed using a lossy compression algorithm
  performed by the Analog Devices 611 Video Codec set on 80% quality
  and decompressed on the ground.
 
  The visible camera's peak power during operation is 2.9 W.  The
  VIS camera has been fixed to an auto-gain/white balance setting.
 
  Scientific Objectives
  =====================
 
  The VIS camera provides context imagery to support interpretation
  of data collected by the other LCROSS instruments.
 
  Calibration
  ===========
 
  There are no calibration files associated with this instrument.
 
  Operational Modes
  =================
 
  The VIS camera has one operational mode: auto-gain and white
  balance enabled.  The DHU can vary the rate at which images are
  downlinked by discarding images from the 30 images/sec input
  stream, and several different frame rates are used at different
  points in the mission.
