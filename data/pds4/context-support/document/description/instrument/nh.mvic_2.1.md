    MVIC is an imager that operates at both visible and near-infrared
    wavelengths using seven separate Charge-Coupled Device detectors
    (CCDs).  Four CCDs have color filters (methane, red, blue and
    near-infrared) for producing color maps and three CCDs have
    panchromatic filters for observations where maximum sensitivity to
    faint light levels is required.  In all cases, the light passes from
    the telescope through a filter and is focused onto the CCDs.
 
    MVIC is integrated with another instrument, LEISA, into a composite
    instrument named Ralph, which supplies A/D conversion, command and
    data handling, and power to both MVIC and LEISA.
