    ===================
 
      The objectives were to locate regions of radiative convergence and divergence as a function of altitude and to indicate 
      the height at which solar energy is absorbed by the atmosphere. This experiment used a small net flux radiometer on the 
      Probe targeted to the dayside of Venus to measure the net solar flux in the 0.2- to 4-micrometer region. The two Probes 
      targeted to the nightside of the planet carried net infrared flux sensors covering the 1- to 25-micrometer region. The 
      instrument weighed about 0.4 kg and used 2.2 W of power.
