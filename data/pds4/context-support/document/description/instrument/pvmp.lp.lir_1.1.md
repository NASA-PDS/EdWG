    ===================
 
      The objectives of this experiment were to measure the atmosphere thermal flux profile, detect cloud layers and infer their composition, 
      and estimate the atmospheric water vapor content. This experiment used a 4-channel infrared radiometer looking down from the probe. Two 
      internal blackbodies were used to allow absolute measurements of the flux in each channel. The instrument weighed about 2 kg and used 
      about 3 W of power.
