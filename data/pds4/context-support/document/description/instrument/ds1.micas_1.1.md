In the absence of input from the DS1 team
    regarding the MICAS instrument, the personnel at the PDS SBN
    assembled the following basic information.
 
    Some additional information can be found in Soderblom et al.,
    2000, 'Miniature Integrated Camera Spectrometer (MICAS) Validation
    Report' [SODERBLOMETAL2000] which is included in the documents
    directory.
 
  Instrument Overview
  ===================
    The Miniature Integrated Camera Spectrometer (MICAS) is an
    integrated multi-channel instrument that includes two visible-
    wavelength imagers; a charged coupled device (VISCCD) and active
    pixel sensor (APS), and two imaging spectrometers; short-
    wavelength infrared (SWIR) and ultraviolet (UV). This instrument
    was flown as a technology demonstration on the New Millennium
    Program (NMP) Deep Space 1 (DS1) Mission. Table 1 provides a
    summary of MICAS instrument optical specifications. MICAS has no
    moving parts, uses a shared multi-wavelength long-focal length
    primary 10-cm telescope and provides a multi-temperature set of
    focal planes. The DS1 spacecraft also uses MICAS imaging for
    autonomous optical navigation.
 
  Technology Objectives
  =====================
    The technology objectives of the MICAS instrument project were to
    flight validate the integrated, self-sequencing camera
    spectrometer to enable future low-mass, low-power payloads for
    NASA missions with severe mass and power constraints. MICAS
    represents a new class of sensors for NASA science missions and
    has broad applicability to a wide range of missions.
 
    The principal MICAS technology (and major NMP DS1 investment) is
    the integrated low-mass SiC multi-temperature, multi-focal-plane
    structure, optical bench, and multi-wavelength optics. Using
    methods and processes developed by SSG, both hot-pressed SiC (for
    overall structure and optics) and composite SiC/SiC (for the SWIR
    structure) were incorporated. The optics were fabricated from hot-
    pressed SiC forms that were clad with silicon and then diamond
    turned. The optical and thermal designs of MICAS have novel
    elements as well. The SWIR focal plane uses a direct-drive
    radiative cooler; the optical configuration using off-axis
    diamond-turned spheres and off-axis toroidal gratings enable
    higher throughput with improved point spread function performance.
    The goal for multi-wavelength optical performance (e.g., providing
    acceptable transmission from ultraviolet through near infrared:
    ~50 to 5000 nanometers) was achieved with a series of optical
    coatings: Pt for the primary mirror, SiC for the UV alone, Al for
    combined VISCCD and SWIR, and Au for SWIR alone. The triangular
    structure with externally mounted optical elements provided easy
    access to all focal planes.
