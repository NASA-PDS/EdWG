            MIRLIN is a 128 x 128 pixel, 7 - 25 µm infrared astronomical camera built at JPL and used on the 
            Palomar 5-meter (200 inch) telescope, the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility 3-meter telescope,
            and the Keck II 10-meter telescope.  MIRLIN's camera is based on Boeing's HF-16 128 x 128 Si:As BIB array.  
            At the IRTF, MIRLIN has a plate scale of 0.475 arcsec/pixel and a field of view of 61 arcsec.  At the IRTF
            its sensitivity for a 5-sigma detection in 60 seconds integration is 90 mJy at 10 microns.  The filter set
            includes the M, N, Q, Q-short, and Q-long filters, the OCLI 6-filter 10 micron silicate set, a 7-filter 
            narrow-band 20 µm set, and a 7-14 µm, 2 percent resolution CVF.
