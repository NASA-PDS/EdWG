In 2001, the Palomar 1.2m Oschin Schmidt telescope located 
in northern San Diego, CA was incorporated into the NEAT 
inventory.  The Palomar "Tri-camera" consists of three 
separate 4096 x 4096 pixel CCDs.  The CCDs are arranged 
in a linear, north-south, orientation and denoted by "A, 
B or C."  An approximate one-degree gap is between each 
CCD and each CCD covers nearly 1.0 square degree.  The 
15 micron pixels yield a pixel scale of 1.01 arc-sec/pixel.  
No filters were used, but matches closely with a Bessel-
type R filter at 0.6 microns and TECs maintained an 
operating temperature of -30 degrees C.  Four amplifiers 
readout the CCD in four quadrants.  This camera, as well 
as the Maui camera, used "CCD485" chips produced by 
Fairchild Imaging.  The central wavelength is 702 nm.

The table below provides a comparison of the QUEST and 
tri-camera instruments used by NEAT at Palomar Observatory.

Regardless of the camera, each CCD chip read to a unique output 
file.  Filenames are based on the universal start time of the 
exposure and, if appropriate, identify the specific chip used.
The Maui and tri-camera images contain the 4080 x 4080 imaging 
area.  The initial orientation of the Maui and Palomar tri-camera 
images has East towards to left and North downward.  Each 
uncompressed, 4k x 4k, image (Palomar tri-camera and Maui) is 
66.6 and 33.3 Mb in size, respectively.
