    ===================
      The infrared spectrometer was designed to study the
      radiation from the inner coma, in the wavelength
      range 2.5-12 micro m.  The instrument included two
      high-resolution spectral channels for the chemical
      analysis of the cometary matter, gas and dust, and
      an image modulation channel for determination of
      the size of and thermal emission from the nucleus.
      The light that exits from the telescope wass
      divided into three beams by means of two beam
      splitters.  The secondary beams were then focussed
      on a wheel that rotated at the rate of 8 rev/sec
      and carried three rings, namely two circular
      variable filters and one image modulator.  Behind
      the encoding wheel, the beams entered a cryostat
      which cooled the three detectors.  The two filters
      covered the ranges 2.5-5 micro m and 6-12 micro m,
      which included the emission bands of the parent
      molecules.  The long-wave channel could detect
      water ice and the short-wave channel could be used
      to identify a number of minerals, such as
      silicates.  The imaging channel did not resolve
      details of the nucleus, the objective being to
      derive its most important parameters: size, shape,
      temperature and optical properties in the infrared.
      To accommodate the nucleus pointing uncertainties,
      a field of view of 1deg was judged necessary and an
      angular resolution of 1 arcmin satisfactory.  More
      instrument characteristics are given in the table
      below.  Since the sensitivity of the instruments
      was degraded by four to five orders of magnitude
      between 77 K and room temperature, it appeared
      mandatory to cool the detectors during the two
      measuring sequences using the Joule-Thomson
      expansion of nitrogen.  For that purpose, 2 l of
      nitrogen were stored in four tanks at a pressure of
      350 atm.  The detector temperatures reached
      stability within 25 min (to +/- 0.1deg) and could
      be maintained so for 3 h.

 Problems:
 (1) No useful data were obtained by the Vega 2 IKS instrument due to
     a failure of the cryogenic system.
 (2) On Vega 1 the instrument operated before the flyby at distances
     between 250,000 km and 40,000 km and after the flyby at distances
     more than 100,000 km. The data flux was erroneously interrupted for
     30m near the closest approach.
 (3) The internal background signal was about 10**4 times the cometary
     signal. Separation of the cometary signal was done assuming its
     variation as r**-1 (where r is the distance to the nucleus) and
     interpolating the background measured at approximately 250,000 km
     before and after the closest approach.
