            The Lander Visual System (LVS) is a camera-based navigation system
            that images the terrain beneath the descending spacecraft during
            its Entry, Descent, and Landing.  LVS computes the final landing
            position by comparing the aquired imagery with onboard maps and,
            further, detects hazards and/or obstacles (such as boulders or
            outcroppings) to be avoided.  In the case where hazards are observed,
            LVS can direct the spacecraft to a safer location.  All this must
            transpire within the very small period of time of 10 seconds.
