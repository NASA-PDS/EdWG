Low-resolution grism spectrographs (a pair of essentially identical instruments) used
on the 1.3 m McGraw-Hill and 2.4 m Hiltner telescopes at MDM Observatory on Kitt
Peak.
The spectrograph was equipped with either a SITE 1024 x 1024 thinned, backside
illuminated CCD (with 24-micron pixels), or a Loral 2048 x 2048 thick, front-side
illuminated CCD (with 15-micron pixels). The spectrograph was used with a
low-resolution grism (150 lines per mm,    
blazed at 0.73 micron), giving a dispersion of roughly 0.001 micron per pixel.
