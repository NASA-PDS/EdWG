The Apollo Passive Seismic Experiment consisted of four seismic stations deployed on the 
            lunar near side between 1969 and 1972 (Apollo 12, 14, 15, 16). These operated continuously from 
            inception to mid-1977, when funding was cut and the data were no longer recorded. Each station 
            consisted of a 3-axis long-period seismometer (sample rate 6.6252 Hz) and vertical-axis 
            short-period seismometer (sample rate 15 Hz.).
