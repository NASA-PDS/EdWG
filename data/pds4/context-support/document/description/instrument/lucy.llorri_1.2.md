The L’LORRI instrument provides the highest-resolution imaging for the Lucy mission. The panchromatic images will address seven of our 17 Level 1 science requirements including
           searching for satellites, determining the size frequency distribution of craters, stereo imaging, andshape reconstruction. The L’LORRI instrument will also be used for optical navigation to our targets.
