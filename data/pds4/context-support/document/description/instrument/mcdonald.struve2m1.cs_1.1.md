  the McDonald Observatory web site.

  The Cassegrain Spectrometer (es2) sits at the Cassegrain
  f/13.7 focus of the 2.1m Otto Struve telescope. The web site
  above provides this general description:

    A low-to-moderate-resolution spectrometer (600-2,500).
    The CCD detectors are CC1 and TI1.  TI1 should be used
    for the blue region and CC1 for the red.  Various
    gratings are available to provide wavelength coverage
    from 0.3 to 1.1 microns.  The spectrometer has long
    slit (120 arcsec) capability.  Ther eis a selection of
    slits of predetermined sizes from 0.5 to 12 arcsec.
    Limiting magnitude m[v]=18MAG.  A STAR1 CCD system
    provides remote guiding, but not autoguiding.  The TV
    system can be used to guide off the slit or in an offset
    mode.
