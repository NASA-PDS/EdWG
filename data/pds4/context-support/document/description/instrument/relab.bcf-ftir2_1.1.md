            Geometry: 	Diffuse reflectance: Biconical, off-axis for Pike specimen holder 
            Transmission: normal incidence (collimated)
            
            Sample:	Particulate specimen or soil (reflectance):
            Measured horizontal and uncovered in purged (H2O, CO2 free) environment.
            Desired specimens amount is 50 - 500 mg.
            Specimen should be no smaller than 20 mg.
            More than 1 g is unnecessary.
            Multiple specimens can be measured in sequence (same environment)
            Chip (reflectance):
            Measured horizontal and uncovered.
            Regions to be measured should be no smaller than 1 mm.
            Maximum size is 1 cm in height and 3 cm in diameter.
            Thin section and single crystal (transmission):
            Measured vertical, attached to an appropriate aperture board.
            Regions to be measured should be no smaller than 1.5 mm.
            Surface should be polished and clean (no carbon coating).
