The OSIRIS-REx Thermal Emission Spectrometer (OTES) is a small infrared (4-50 Âµm) point spectrometer that
         acquires an interferogram every 2 seconds. Interferograms are processed on the ground and converted to infrared spectra. 
         OTES uses space and internal calibration target views for calibration. OTES will map Bennu and the sample site from a 
         distance of 7 to 0.5 km with 55 to 4 m resolution using spacecraft and asteroid motion.
