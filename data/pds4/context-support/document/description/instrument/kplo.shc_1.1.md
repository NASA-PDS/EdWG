      ShadowCam is a NASA-funded instrument that will collect
      high-resolution images of Permanently Shadowed Regions
      (PSRs). ShadowCam will provide critical information about
      the terrain of PSRs and the distribution and accessibility of
      water ice and other volatiles at spatial scales (1.7 m/pixel)
      required to mitigate risks and maximize the results of future
      exploration activities.
