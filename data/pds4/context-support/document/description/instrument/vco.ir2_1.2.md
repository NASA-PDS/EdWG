            IR2, the 2-micron camera, is intended to study the meteorology of Venus by
            utilizing near-infrared (NIR) windows of the CO2 atmosphere. Contrast features at
            1.74 and 2.3 micron on the night-side disk are the silhouette of spatially
            inhomogeneous scatterers/absorbers, back-illuminated by the glow of the hot (300-500 K)
            lower atmosphere. A channel centered at 2.02 micron, which contains a CO2 absorption
            feature, allows the determination of cloud top altitude by measuring reflected sunlight
            on the dayside. IR2, one of the key instruments onboard Akatsuki, is intended to image
            Venus in these NIR windows.
