            A low-pressure recirculating wind tunnel. The 2010 wind tunnel, which is contained in a ~ 2.5 x 8 m 
            tank, has a test volume much larger than the AWTSI, which is a tube with a cross-section of 40 cm 
            allowing an experimental area of about 0.5 m in length. Except from the size of the experimental volumes, 
            the achievable environmental conditions are similar.
