              The Apollo 14 Charged Particle Lunar Environment Experiment (CPLEE) measured the
              energy spectra of low-energy charged particles striking the lunar surface by observing
              the fluxes of electrons and ions with energies from 40 eV to 20 keV in two directions:
              local vertical and 60 degrees from vertical toward lunar west. The primary purpose of
              the experiment was to examine plasma particles originating from the Sun and the
              low-energy particle flux in the magnetic tail of the Earth.
