            The Hitachi S5500 Field-Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) is a sub-nanometer field-emission SEM which can also operate as a Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) in a 
            scanning mode (STEM). This dual SEM and STEM microscope can reach the world's highest resolution of 0.4 nm at 30 kV using the secondary electron detector. It simultaneously 
            provides surface topography (SE mode) in conjunction with bulk information (STEM mode) making 3-D morphological observations possible. The STEM mode uses brightfield and 
            darkfield detectors enabling crystal lattice resolution and true Z-contrast imaging for different material composition and thickness. This instrumentation is located at the 
            University of Texas at San Antonio's Kleberg Advanced Microscopy Center.
