Instrument Overview
===================
  This document describes the instrument used to obtain the infrared
  spectrum of 951 Gaspra reported in Goldader et al. 1991, A. J.
  102, 1503-1509 [GOLDADERETAL1991].  The instrumentation consisted
  of a double CVF with a liquid nitrogen cooled InSb photometer.
  The short half of the CVF (denoted DCS) covered the region from
  ~0.8 - 1.6 microns with 3% resolution, and the long half (denoted
  DCL) covered ~1.5 - 2.5 microns at 5% resolution.  For this
  spectrum, every other position of the CVF was sampled for the DCS
