            The FLOYDS instruments are cross-dispersed, low-resolution spectrographs. Wavelength coverage is
            540-1000nm first order, 320-570nm second order. Both orders are projected simultaneously on the
            CCD detector. The instruments include HgAr and Zn lamps for wavelength calibration, and a 
            Tungsten-Halogen + Xenon lamp for flat fielding. Data produced by the instruments are "automatically
            processed to produce 2D rectified images and extracted 1D spectra with wavelength scale and flux 
            calibration applied" (quote from website). Users should consult the data product documentation if
            it is necessary to determine which telescope/instrument produced a specific observation.
