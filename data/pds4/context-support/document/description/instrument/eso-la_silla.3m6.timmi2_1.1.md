TIMMI2 is a multi mode (imaging, polarimetry, and long slit spectroscopy)
thermal-infrared (4-20 um) instrument working at the ESO/3.6m Cassegrain, f/35 focus.
Lenses offering different magnifications are available in the different bands: 0.3
arcsec/pixel in the L and M bands; 0.2 arcsec/pixel and 0.3 arcsec/pixel in the N
band; and 0.2 arcsec/pixel in the Q band.  The array is a Si:As chip manufactured by
Raytheon, with format 320 x 240 pixels (the pixel size is 50 microns), distributed in
16 channels of 20 columns each. So the field sizes are 64x48 arcsecs or 96x72 arcsecs
for the small and large field lenses, respectively. It's sensitive from 2 to 28
microns, with a mean QE of 31.6 percent, a read noise of 922e-, a full well capacity
of 1.13x107/2.04x107e- (high/low gain), and a dark current < 100e-/sec at T=6K.
