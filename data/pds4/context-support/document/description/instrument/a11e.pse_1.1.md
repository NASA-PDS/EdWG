The Apollo 11 Passive Seismic Experiment was the first seismometer placed on the surface
            of the moon. It detected lunar "moonquakes," providing information about the internal structure of 
            the Moon. The seismometer returned data for only three weeks; more advanced seismometers were 
            deployed at the Apollo 12, 14, 15, and 16 landing sites.
