  ===================
    (adapted from: Lanzerotti, et al. 1992)
 
 The are Low-Energy Foil Spectrometers (LEFS)
 provide pulse-height-analyzed single-detector measurements
 with active anticoincidence. The foil thickness, detector 
 thicknesses, and electronic thresholds were selected to 
 enable the separation of low energy electron and ion 
 fluxes at high sensitivity by comparing detector responses.
 
 The individual LEFS telescopes are referred to as LEFS 60, 
 and LEFS 150, where the number indicates the inclination of 
 the telescope axis with respect to the spacecraft spin axis.
 The MF, M' F', and BC detector pairs (Tab. 1) are
 identical (for ease of replacement pre-flight); each consists
 of two equal 200 micrometer thick, totally depleted silicon surface
 barrier detectors. The D detector is a thin (5 micrometer) silicon
 detector of the epitaxial type.
 
 The orientations  of the telescope axes are such that there is
 nearly a complete 41r coverage of the unit sphere during
 one complete spacecraft spin. 
 
 In the LEFS 60 and LEFS 120 telescopes, a thin
 ( ~0.35 mg cm-2) aluminized parylene foil prevents ions
 (~350 keV) from reaching the F and F' detector, while
 electrons (~30 keV) can penetrate the foil with little
 energy loss. The logic and energy channels for both LEFS
 telescopes are listed in Table 2. Both telescopes also have
 a geometrical factor of ~0.48 cm2 sr.
