            The Radio Science Subsystem for Venus Climate Orbiter Akatsuki includes elements on both
            the spacecraft and the ground. The spacecraft element (covered by this context product) was
            further distributed among several subsystems on the spacecraft, while the ground element
            included ground stations at Usuda Deep Space Center of JAXA, Indian Deep Space Network
            (IDSN) of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), and Weilheim station (WHM) of the
            German Aerospace Center (DLR).

            The radio communication system of the spacecraft works with X-band downlink frequency only.
            During the experiments, one of the X-band transponders is locked to an Ultra-Stable
            Oscillator (USO), and the transponder signal is amplified by a traveling wave tube amplifier.
            The USO provides the stable reference frequency for the transponder.

            Downlink signals are amplified and radiated through a slot array antenna toward the tracking
            stations on Earth. The radio waves sequentially go behind the planet's ionosphere and
            neutral atmosphere as seen from the tracking stations, and reemerges in the reverse sequence.
            During such occultation events the neutral and ionized atmospheres of the planet cause
            bending, attenuation and scintillation of radio waves. The perturbed signal is collected by
            ground stations, amplified, down-converted, and recorded for later analysis. From the
            changes in bending angle and attenuation, atmospheric profiles of density, temperature and
            H2SO4 amount in the neutral atmosphere as well as electron density in the ionosphere of the
            planet can be derived. During superior conjunctions solar corona observations are also
            performed.
