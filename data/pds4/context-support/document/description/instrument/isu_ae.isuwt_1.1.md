One of several wind tunnels operated by Iowa State University's Department of Aerospace Engineering, Ames, IA. 
 
Historically a sister wind tunnel to the Planetary Aeolian Laboratory's MARSWIT, and Arizona State University's 
Boundary Layer Wind Tunnel, with similar dimensions and capabilities. This tunnel was under the direction of 
James D. Iversen, who worked closely with Ronald Greeley on examining boundary layer conditions for Earth, Mars,
Venus, and Titan. Greeley and Iversen co-authored a well-known book on the topic, "Wind as a Geologic Process" (1985)
where much of the wind tunnel work from these tunnels was published.
