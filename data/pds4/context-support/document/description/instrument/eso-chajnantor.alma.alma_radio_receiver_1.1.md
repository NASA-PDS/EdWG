ALMA is an interferometer comprising (as of this writing) 66 individual antennas,
each with a suite of detectors designed for various parts of the spectral range.

Frequency bands of receivers: The ALMA Front End, with all 10 receiver bands
integrated, is able to detect signals from 8.6 mm to 0.32 mm in wavelength,
equivalent to 35 GHz to 950 GHz in frequency. The following table shows the
specifications of individual ALMA receivers for science observations.
Band 1: In production. It covers the wavelength range of 6.00-8.57 mm (35-50 GHz).
Band 2: Under development. It will cover the wavelength range of 3.33-4.48 mm (67-90
GHz).
Band 3: Produced by the Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics in Canada. It covers the
longest wavelength range of the bands initially installed, between 2.59-3.57 mm
(84-116 GHz).
Band 4: Developed by National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ). It covers a
wavelength range of 1.84-2.40 mm (125-163 GHz).
Band 5: Developed by the Group for Advanced Receiver Development (GARD) at Onsala
Space Observatory, Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden. The production of the
66 receivers for the ALMA observatory was done jointly by GARD and NOVA. It covers a
wavelength range of 1.42-1.84 mm (163-211 GHz).
Band 6: Produced by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO). It covers the
wavelength range of 1.09-1.42 mm (211-275 GHz).
Band 7: Delivered by the Institut de Radio Astronomie Millimétrique (IRAM). It covers
the wavelength range of 0.80-1.09 mm (275-373 GHz).
Band 8: Developed by NAOJ. It covers the wavelength range of 0.60-0.78 mm (385-500
GHz).
Band 9: Produced by the Nederlandse Onderzoekschool voor Astronomie (NOVA). It covers
the wavelength range 0.42–0.50 mm (602-720 GHz).
Band 10: Developed and produced led by NAOJ. It covers the wavelength range 0.32-0.38
mm (787-950 GHz).
