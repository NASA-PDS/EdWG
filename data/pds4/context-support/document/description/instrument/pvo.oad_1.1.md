    ===================
 
        The Orbiter Atmospheric Drag (OAD) experiment made use of the spacecraft S-band and X-band radio signals for data 
        measurements. The objectives were (1) to establish the diurnal variation of thermospheric density and density scale 
        height (2) to determine the relationship of solar wind variations to variations in atmospheric density, (3) to determine 
        the relationship of long and short term variation in solar extreme UV radiation to density variations, (4) to search 
        for phenomena such as a semi-annual variation and super rotation of the thermosphere, and (5) to formulate a thermospheric 
        model for the Venusian atmosphere.
 
        The OAD experiment worked by measuring the Doppler shift in X and S band transmissions to the Deep Space Network. The 
        shift would give the spacecraft acceleration along a line-of-sight from the spacecraft to the receiver. The accelerations 
        at periapsis, when the orbiter was in the region of highest atmospheric density and the drag effect was greatest, were used, 
        along with the spacecraft mass, and spacecraft orientation (giving the cross-section), to give a drag coefficient. This, 
        combined with atmospheric models, gave an estimate of the atmospheric density at that altitude. Since the periapsis altitude 
        changed with time, different depths in the atmosphere would be sampled. The effects of the drag on the evolution of the orbital 
        period and inclination were also used with, and fed into, an atmospheric model. The results could be used to study diurnal and 
        semi-annual variations, variations with solar activity, and possibly the super-rotation of the upper atmosphere.
