 in the near-infrared range from 0.8 to 2.6 mm in 64 channels to       
 determine the distribution and abundance of surface minerals like     
 olivine and pyroxene.  This grating spectrometer disperses the        
 light from the slit FOV (0.38 x 0.76 deg in its narrow position       
 and 0.76 x 0.76 deg in the wide position) across a pair of            
 passively cooled one-dimensional array detectors, one a germanium     
 array covering the lower wavelengths 0.8 to 1.5 mm and the other      
 an indium/gallium- arsenide array covering 1.3 to 2.6 mm. The slit    
 can be closed for dark current measurement. The NIS has a scan        
 mirror that enables it to view the common boresight direction         
 (within the MSI FOV) or directions more than 90 deg away. Spectral    
 images can be built up by a combination of scan mirror and            
 spacecraft motions. In addition, the NIS has a gold calibration       
 target that can be positioned to scatter sunlight into the            
 instrument and provide a quantitative, in-flight spectral             
 calibration.
