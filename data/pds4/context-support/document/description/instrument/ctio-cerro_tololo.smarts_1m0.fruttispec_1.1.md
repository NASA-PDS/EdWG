The 2D-Frutti was a two-dimensional photon counting detector, originally developed by
Steve Shectman then of the Mt Wilson and Las Campanas Observatories. The sensitivity
of this detector is determined by the S-20 photocathode of the Carnegie image tube
which provides the first intensification stage.  This peaks at ~ 4200A, declining
slowly toward the red, so that 7300A can be taken as its red limit.  In the UV, the
2D-Frutti was sensitive down to the atmospheric cutoff (3200A).  The 2D-Frutti
offered a format up to 1.5-M pixels, zero readout noise, and low dark current ( < 1
count/pixel/hour for 1x1 binning). Conversely the 2D-Frutti could be irreversibly
damaged by over illumination and count rates must be further limited to typically < 1
cts/pixel/second, because of coincidence losses. Even with these precautions, the
2D-Frutti was not really all that linear.
