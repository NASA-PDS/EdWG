The InSight radiometer is associated with the Heat Flow and Physical
        Properties Package (HP3). It is designed to measurement surface temperature in support
        of HP3 in determining the subsurface temperature profile. The radiometer is mounted
        on the lander. It measures the radiative flux in three infrared bands.
