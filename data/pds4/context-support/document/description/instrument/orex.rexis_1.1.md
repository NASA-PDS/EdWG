The Regolith X-ray Imaging Spectrometer (REXIS) will provide an X-ray map of Bennu, complementing
        core OSIRIS-REx mission science. REXIS has been selected as an education and public outreach element
        of the OSIRIS-REx mission investigation after a competitive selection process. As a Student Collaboration
        Experiment (SCE), REXIS will be incorporated into the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft on a non-impact basis and
        will remain clearly separable from the rest of the OSIRIS-REx investigation. Data analysis will be handled
        as a student project, available to both Harvard and MIT students, for credit or non-credit within the MIT
        curriculum, and within the MIT Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP).
