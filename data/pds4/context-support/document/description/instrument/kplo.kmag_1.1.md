      KMAG is a set of three magnetometers developed by Kyung
      Hee University (KHU) that will measure the lunar magnetic
      field from and around the Moon. The three magnetometers are
      mounted on a boom which minimizes spacecraft interference.
      Having three magnetometers provides redundancy and
      magnetic interference corrections; they can also be used
      together for a multi-sensor technical investigation. The boom
      will be nadir pointing during orbital operations.
