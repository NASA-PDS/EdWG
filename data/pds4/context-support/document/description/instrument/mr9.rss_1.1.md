            Instrument Overview
            ===================
            The Mariner 9 (MR9) Radio Science investigations
            utilized instrumentation with elements on the spacecraft and
            at the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN).  Much of this was
            shared equipment, being used for routine telecommunications
            as well as for Radio Science.  The performance and
            calibration of both the spacecraft and tracking stations
            directly affected the radio science data accuracy, and they
            played a major role in determining the quality of the
            results.  The spacecraft part of the radio science
            instrument is described immediately below; that is followed
            by a description of the DSN (ground) part of the instrument.

            ======================================
            The Mariner 9 spacecraft telecommunications
            subsystem served as part of a radio science subsystem for
            investigations of Mars.  Many details of the subsystem are
            unknown; its 'launch date' is known to be 1971-05-30.

            ================================
            The Doppler shift of the S-band telemetry signal during
            occultation of the spacecraft by Mars provided the vertical
            distribution of the index of refraction of the Martian
            atmosphere. These data yield the vertical distribution of
            neutral and ionized species.
