            The DART HGA is a Spiral Radial Line Slot Array that is gimballed. It is the primary antenna 
            of DART that provides the RS data collected during the last 30 days of the mission. This 
            low-cost, high-gain antenna enabled high-efficiency communications in a compact, planar form. 
            DART operates at the X-band DSN frequencies of 7.168 (Uplink) and 8.422 GHz (Downlink). 
            There is approximately a 15% difference in frequency between uplink and downlink 
            (see Bray (2020)). The transponder delay (including RF propagation through waveguides, coax, 
            etc.) is about 12650 nsec.
