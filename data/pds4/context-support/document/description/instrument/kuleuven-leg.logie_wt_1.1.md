            Once part of the Laboratory of Experimental Geomorphology, this wooden tunnel was in use around 1980-1981 at the Catholic University
            (Katholieke Universiteit) of Leuven, Belgium. The wind tunnel is an open circulation, suction-type tunnel with overall length of 7 m.
            The working section dimensions are: length, 1.5 m, width, 0.346 m and unknown height. The laboratory was most likely subsumed into the
            Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Geography and Tourism Division. Unknown if the tunnel is still in use.
