GMOS-S is one of two identical instruments mounted on the Gemini telescopes.  GMOS-S
is mounted on the Gemini South telescope.

The GMOS are long-slit and multi-slit imaging spectrographs with a 5.5 square
arcminute field of view and a wavelength range of 0.36-0.94 micrometers. An Integral
Field Unit is also availabe to obtain spectra from a 35 square arcsecond field of
view with a sampling of 0.2 arcseconds. The Nod-and-Shuffle mode, which enables
superior sky subtraction, is available with both GMOS-N and GMOS-S in most
spectroscopic modes.
