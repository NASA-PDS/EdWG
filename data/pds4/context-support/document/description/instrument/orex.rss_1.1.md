            The spacecraft element of the OSIRIS-REx radio science instrument was the 
            onboard telecommunications subsystem.  It included a pair of cross-strapped redundant 
            General Dynamics Small Deep Space Transponder Group Buy III X/X transponders, two cross-strapped 100-watt traveling wave tube
            amplifiers, and four antennas.  Cross-strapping protected the mission against single point failures in the telecom subsystem.
             
            The antenna location in reference to the s/c frame are defined as follows:
               -  the HGA frame is nominally rotated from the s/c frame by +90 degrees about Y, then by -150 about Z.
               -  the MGA frame is nominally rotated from the s/c frame by +106 degrees about Y.
               -  the LGA_PX frame is nominally rotated from the s/c frame by +135 degrees about Y.
               -  the LGA_MX frame is nominally rotated from the s/c frame by -45 degrees about Y.
            Turnaround Ratio – 840/749
            Nominal uplink and downlink frequencies – Nominal Rx Freq – 7188.499990 MHz, Nominal Tx Freq – 8445.767679 MHz
            The transponder carrier delay variation is +/- 3 ns  

            The radio science investigation used all available data over the course of the mission.
