The Optical System for Imaging and low-Intermediate Resolution Integrated
Spectroscopy (OSIRIS) of the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) is an imager and
spectrograph for optical wavelengths. Wavelength range coverage is 0.365 - 1.05
microns; total field of view is 7.8 x 8.5 arcminutes for direct imaging and 7.5x6.0
arcminutes for multi-object spectroscopy.

OSIRIS has a number of operating modes. Imaging modes include: broad, medium, and
narrow band imaging with various filters; fast photometry; and frame transfer
photometry.  Spectroscopic modes include long-slit spectroscopy and multi-object
spectroscopy.
