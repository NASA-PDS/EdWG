    ===================
      The vector helium magnetometer is mounted on the
      end of a 3 m boom and makes in-situ measurements of
      the ambient magnetic field vector in the frequency
      range 0-3 Hz.  The instrument automatically chooses
      one of eight ranges in which to operate, the four
      lowest full-scale ranges being +/-4, +/- 14, +/-42,
      and +/- 146 nT.  The precision of measurement is
      1/256 of the full-scale field values (0.016, 0.055
      nT, etc.).  The absolute accuracy is limited by
      knowledge of the spacecraft magnetic field, which
      is presently known to better than 0.1 nT.  The time
      resolution corresponds to three triaxial samples
      per second at 1024 bit/s .  The magnetometer
      contains a three- channel spectrum analyzer which
      is connected to the search-coil sensor of the
      plasma- wave investigation.
