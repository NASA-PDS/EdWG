The Near-Infrared Spectrometer is a spectrometer on the Hayabusa spacecraft. NIRS is composed of a grating     
            infrared spectrometer (N1RS-S), a spectrometer electronics (NIRS-E) and a   
            data processing unit to control NIRS, which is also used to operate the     
            Hayabusa XRS. During the course of the missoin NIRS examined the asteroid's spectral features in the near infrared region       
            of the spectrum during the mission.
