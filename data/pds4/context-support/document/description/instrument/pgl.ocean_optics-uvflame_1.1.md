            The 0.2-0.88 um wavelength range was acquired at ambient room temperature and pressure with an Ocean Optics 
            UV-Flame spectrometer (biconical), using a fiber optic cable, with a spectral resolution of 1.4 nm FWHM at an 
            incidence angle (i) of 0ยบ and 30ยบ emission angle (e); phase angle (phi) of 30ยบ. Illumination was provided with a 
            combined deuterium arc lamp (0.2-0.5 um) and quartz halogen light source (0.4-0.88 um), with light transmitted to 
            the sample via a fiber optic cable.
