    Abstract.  -- The Solar Wind Ion Composition Spectrometer
    (SWICS) on Ulysses is designed to determine uniquely the
    elemental and ionic-charge composition, and the temperatures
    and mean speeds of all major solar-wind ions, from H through
    Fe, at solar wind speeds ranging from 175 km/s (protons) to
    1280 km/s (Fe^8+).  The instrument, which covers an energy per
    charge range from 0.16 to 59.6 keV/e in ~ 13 min, combines an
    electrostatic analyzer with post-acceleration, followed by a
    time-of-flight and energy measurement.  The measurements made
    by SWICS will have an impact on many areas of solar and
    heliospheric physics, in particular providing essential and
    unique information on: (i) conditions and processes in the
    region of the corona where the solar wind is accelerated, (ii)
    the location of the source regions of the solar wind in the
    corona; (iii) coronal heating processes; (iv) the extent and
    causes of variations in the composition of the solar
    atmosphere; (v)plasma processes in the solar wind; (vi) the
    acceleration of energetic particles in the solar wind; (vii)
    the thermalization and acceleration of interstellar ions in the
    solar wind, and their composition; and (viii) the composition,
    charge states and behavior of the plasma in various regions of
    the Jovian magnetosphere.
