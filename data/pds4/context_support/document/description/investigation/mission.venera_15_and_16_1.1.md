  ================
    The main source for this text is the National Space Science Data Center.
    Venera 15 and 16 were a two spacecraft mission primarily designed to
    use 8 cm band side-looking radar mappers to study the surface properties
    of Venus. The primary instruments of each spacecraft were a synthetic
    aperture radar experiment and a radar altimeter experiment. Each
    spacecraft also carried an energetic particles experiment, an infrared
    Fourier spectrometer, and a radio occultation experiment.
