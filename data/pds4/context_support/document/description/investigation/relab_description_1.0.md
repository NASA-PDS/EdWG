# RELAB Spectral Library Description

## RELAB Overview

<span class="mark">Spectroscopic data acquired in the laboratory provide
the interpretive foundation upon which compositional information about
unexplored or un-sampled planetary surfaces is derived from remotely
obtained reflectance spectra.  The NASA Reflectance Experiment
Laboratory (RELAB, <http://planetary.brown.edu/relab/>) is supported by
NASA as a multi-user spectroscopy facility, and laboratory time can be
made available at no charge to investigators who are in funded NASA
programs.</span>

<span class="mark">RELAB has two operational spectrometers available to
NASA scientists:  
1) a near-ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared bidirectional
spectrometer  
2) a near-, mid-, and far-infrared FT-IR spectrometer.</span>

<span class="mark">The overall purpose of the design and operation of
the RELAB bidirectional spectrometer is to obtain high precision, high
spectral resolution, bidirectional reflectance spectra of earth and
planetary materials.  One of the key elements of its design is the
ability to measure samples using viewing geometries specified by the
user.  This allows investigators to simulate the geometry of natural
observing conditions for particulate samples as small as 10 mg.
