The Arecibo Observatory Planetary Radar system was used to observe asteroids
and planetary surfaces with its 12.6 cm (2380 MHz) and 70-cm (430 MHz) radar systems from 1963 to 2020. 
This investigation provides processed data from Doppler-only spectroscopy and delay-Doppler imaging of those bodies.
Most of the data in this investigation was of small bodies, but data from other targets (planets and moons) are also included. 
Most of the data are from after the "Gregorian Upgrade" of the telescope in the late 1990s, as earlier
data were rarely preserved due to data volume and loss of knowledge of the organization of the data.
