The Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking (NEAT) 
            project began as a collaborative effort with the United States Air
            Force (USAF) in December 1995.  It concentrated on the discovery and
            observations of near-Earth asteroids and comets, collectively called  
            near-Earth objects (NEOs).  NEAT ended its observations in April 2007.
            Throughout its history, NEAT utilized three 1m class telescopes - two 
            on the Hawaiian island of Maui and the 1.2m Oschin Schmidt telescope  
            at Palomar Observatory near San Diego, CA.  Three unique cameras were 
            developed and used throughout the program.  These data are intended to
            be usable for photometric analysis of the various objects within the  
            NEAT data.  Most nights included calibration data, and the lists of   
            photometric standard calibration fields.
