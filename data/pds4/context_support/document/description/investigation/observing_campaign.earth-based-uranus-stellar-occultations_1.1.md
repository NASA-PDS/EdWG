            This observing campaign collates Earth-based observations of Uranus stellar occultations (1972-2002). 
            Observations were primarily obtained using a variety of high speed photometers, and include several 
            early events that were recorded only on strip charts, additional high-SNR unpublished ground-based 
            observations, two occultations observed from the Hubble Space Telescope, and two occultations observed 
            using 2D imaging arrays.
