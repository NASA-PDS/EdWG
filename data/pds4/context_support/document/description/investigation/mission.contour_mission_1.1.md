 
The Comet Nucleus Tour, or CONTOUR, mission launched from Cape Canaveral on
July 3, 2002. Six weeks later, on August 15, contact with the spacecraft was
lost after a planned maneuver that was intended to propel it out of Earth
orbit and into its comet-chasing solar orbit. Evidence suggests the
spacecraft split into several pieces, and so far all efforts to make contact
with CONTOUR have failed.
