            The Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) mission to the near-earth asteroid 433 Eros 
            was launched in Feb. 1996 and carried out Eros orbital operations from Feb. 2000 
            through Feb. 2001. It acquired the first comprehensive, spatially resolved 
            measurements of the geomorphology, reflectance spectral properties, and shape of an 
            asteroid, and X-ray and gamma-ray spectral measurements of elemental abundances from 
            orbit and the surface. The ambient magnetic field in the vicinity of Eros was also 
            measured. On the way to Eros, the spacecraft also performed a flyby of the asteroid 
            253 Mathilde in June 1997, obtaining image data and a mass determination.
