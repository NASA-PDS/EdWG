            The main goal of the mission of Akatsuki, also known as Venus Climate Orbiter (VCO)
            and PLANET-C is to understand the Venusian atmospheric dynamics, super-rotation,
            and cloud physics, with the explorations of the ground surface and
            the interplanetary dust also being the themes. The Venusian atmosphere was studied
            during the Venus Express mission of the European Space Agency. Akatsuki was also
            designed to study the Venusian atmosphere, but in contrast to the Venus Express strategy,
            five cameras with narrowband filters will image Venus at different wavelengths to track
            the distributions of clouds and minor gaseous constituents at different heights.
            In other words, we aim to study the Venusian atmospheric dynamics in three dimensions,
            while Venus Express collected mainly spectroscopic observations of the atmosphere.
            The mission started with the mission name and the spacecraft name PLANET-C, which means
            Japan's third planetary explorer succeeding SUISEI (PLANET-A), which observed Halley's
            comet, and NOZOMI (PLANET-B), which could not complete its mission to explore Mars.
