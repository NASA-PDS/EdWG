 
            During lunar exploration missions outside of the Earthâ€™s protective atmosphere, exposure to space 
            radiation has a detrimental effect on the health of the astronauts. Lunar surface environments 
            present a greater radiation risk to the astronaut than Low Earth Orbit (LEO). There are two sources 
            of radiation risk for lunar surface environments. The first source of risk is the total radiation 
            dose from Galactic Cosmic Rays, which is about twice as high on the lunar surface as in LEO. The 
            second source of risk is from space weather events resulting from solar activity. The Linear Energy 
            Transfer Spectrometer (LETS) is a radiation monitor that is derived from heritage hardware flown 
            on Orion EFT-1 and slated to fly on the Orion EM-1 mission that will enable acquisition of knowledge 
            of the lunar radiation environment and demonstrate the capabilities of a system on the lunar surface. 
            The LETS radiation sensor is a solid-state silicon Timepix detector that is derived from heritage 
            hardware that was flown on Orion EFT-1. This sensor measured the rate of incident radiation providing 
            information that is critical to understanding and mitigating the hazardous environment that people will 
            experience as they explore the surface of the Moon.
