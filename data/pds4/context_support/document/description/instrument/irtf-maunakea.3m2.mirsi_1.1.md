            MIRSI (Mid-InfraRed Spectrometer and Imager) is a mid-infrared camera system with both spectroscopic 
            and imaging capabilities. The MIRSI team developed the instrument at Boston University, with funding 
            from the NSF and Boston University. MIRSI is a supported instrument at the NASA Infrared Telescope 
            Facility (IRTF) on Mauna Kea.
