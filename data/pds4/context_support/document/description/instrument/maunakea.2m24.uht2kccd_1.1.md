This instrument is a CCD camera built around a Tektronix 2048x2048 thinned and
backside-illuminated CCD chip, with a 7.5 x 7.5 arcminute field of view.  The read
noise is 6.0 electrons and the gain is 1.74 electrons/ADU.  The scale is 0.219
arcseconds/pix.  The detector can be operated in binned mode, such as 2x2 pixels. 
The CCD is known to have a peak quantum efficiency near 95% in the R band, and has
shown itself to be readily calibrated, and free from gross cosmetic defects.

The set of BVRI filters for this CCD are the Kron-Cousins photometric system. The
filters have the following central wavelengths and widths:

          Center FWHM  Width/delta
          Wavelength    lambda
