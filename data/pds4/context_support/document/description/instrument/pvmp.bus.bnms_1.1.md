    ===================
 
      This neutral particle mass spectrometer experiment obtained measurements which provided information on the origin 
      and evolution of Venus' atmosphere, the present energy balance and dynamics of the upper atmosphere, and the interaction 
      of the upper atmosphere with solar radiation and the interplanetary medium. A magnetic deflection, double-focusing mass 
      spectrometer was flown to measure the upper atmosphere neutral molecules in the mass range 1 to 46 atomic mass units (u).
