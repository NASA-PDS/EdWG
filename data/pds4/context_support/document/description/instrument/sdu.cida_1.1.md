    Scientific Objectives
    =====================
      The main objective of CIDA was the analysis of particulates in the
      interstellar dust stream and the cometary coma. Important
      ancillary data were expected on dust flux rate, particle size
      distribution and possibly particle mass densities.
 
 
    Instrument Overview
    ===================
      Cometary and Interstellar Dust Analyzer (CIDA) was a space-
      qualified time-of-flight mass-spectrometer. Each impacting
      particle provided a time-of-flight spectrum that can be
      transformed into a mass spectrum once at least two peaks are
      found to which well-known atomic mass unit values can be assigned.
      CIDA comprised a silver target and single-stage ion reflector,
      followed by an open electron multiplier.
 
      The CIDA instrument analyzed the composition of individual
      grains. As each particle impacted a silver plate, the high impact
      energy due to the relative velocity of the spacecraft as it flies
      through the coma caused the elements and molecular compounds in
      the particle to become ionized. Using a fast time-of-flight mass
      spectrometer, a complete set of ions was detected for each
      impact, from a mass range of 1 (atomic hydrogen) up to a few
      thousand atomic mass units, encompassing all elements in the
      periodic table and many molecules, such as organic compounds.
 
      This diagram illustrates CIDA mounting on the Stardust
      spacecraft:

   Operational Modes
   =================
      The on-board data handling system had been optimized for two
      separate operation modes: the cruise mode and the encounter mode.
      In the cruise mode, the expected event rates were so low that
      complete sets of data were easily transferred to ground. In the
      encounter mode, to be used during comet flyby, the impact-driven
      data rate would essentially saturate the instrument and the
      spacecraft's allocated data storage for CIDA of 200 megabits on
      STARDUST. Therefore, in this mode the instrument data handling
      optimized the size of the data passed to the spacecraft and
      attempted to discard all events not obviously containing
      meaningful data. In order to check the performance of the
      selection process, every 16th triggered event was transmitted
      unaltered, regardless of its contents. Every triggering event was
      counted, but only a subset of data would be transferred to the
      spacecraft and thence to the ground.
