            The Las Cumbres website describes the Network of Robotic Echelle Spectrographs (NRES) as
            "four identical high-resolution (R~53,000), precise (â‰¤ 3 m/s), optical (380-860 nm) echelle
            spectrographs, each fiber-fed (2.58" per fiber width) simultaneously by two 1 meter telescopes
            and a ThAr calibration source." As of this writing, NRES units are located at the Cerro Tololo
            Inter-American Observatory (CTIO), South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO), McDonal 
            Observatory, and Wise Observatory only (that is, not all Las Cumbres 1m telescopes host an
            NRES node).
