            A low-pressure recirculating wind tunnel. The wind tunnels are used for the multi-disciplinary scientific 
            study of aerosol formation and transport (on Mars and Earth), granular electrification, magnetic properties,
            erosion, cohesion/adhesion, water transport, UV induced mineralogy, bacterial survival and much more. The 
            wind tunnels are accessible to national and international collaborators and space agencies for scientific 
            experiments, instrument testing, calibration and qualification. The wind tunnels have been financed by 
            Aarhus University, the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Villum Kann Rasmussen Foundation.
