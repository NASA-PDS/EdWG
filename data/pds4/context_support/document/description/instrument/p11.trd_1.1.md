  ===================
    Using five different types of telescopes, the trapped radiation
    detector was designed to provide basic information about several of
    the fundamental features of Jupiter's radiation belts including the
    types of particles within the belts, their distribution, energy, and
    intensity.
 
    An unfocused Cerenkov counter detected the light emitted in a
    particular direction as particles passed through it. It recorded
    electrons of energy 0.5 to 12 MeV. An electron scatter detector was
    activated by electrons at 100 to 400 keV. A minimum ionizing
    detector, consisting of a solid-state diode, measured minimum
    ionizing particles (i.e., less than 3 MeV) and protons in the range
    of 50 to 350 MeV. Finally, two scintillation detectors distinguished
    roughly between electrons of less than 5 and protons of less than
    50 keV.
