    Instrument Description
    ======================
      The radio system is composed primarily of an ultrastable
      oscillator (1 part in 10**12), a ground-based transmitter and
      receiver, a spacecraft transmitter and receiver, and antennae.
      The radio signal (approximately 2200 MHz) is transmitted from
      one of the three Deep Space Station antennae (Goldstone,
      California; Madrid, Spain; or Canberra, Australia) and then
      received at the spacecraft.  The signal is immediately
      retransmitted (there is a multiplication by 240/221 to prevent
      feedback into the spacecraft receiver loop) and then received
      at earth, where it is differenced with the originally
      transmitted signal.
 
      A detailed description is given by the Deep Space
      Network/Flight Project Design Handbook, Jet Propulsion
      Laboratory, TRK/20, Doc.  180-5, Rev D, Pasadena, Calif., 1979.
 
      The difference in frequency (the Doppler shift) can be measured
      to less than 0.01 Hz S band (about 0.65 mm/s) for a 5-second
      averaging time.  However, there are error sources which
      frequently degrade this accuracy.  Such things as the earth's
      troposphere and ionosphere, the Venus atmosphere, and space
      plasma cause the data noise level to increase by several
      factors.  The noise levels were very dynamic and changed
      significantly from day to day.  In some cases where solar
      conjunction was approaching, the noise increased by a factor of
      10 or more and made the data unusable.  The data are displayed
      as residuals which were obtained by differencing the raw
      observation with the theoretical calculation.
