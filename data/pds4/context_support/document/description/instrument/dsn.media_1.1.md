             The Media Calibration Subsystem (DMD) provides three types of data:
             (1) Global Positioning System (GPS) data consisting of L-band carrier
                 phase and group delay of GPS satellite signals, ephemeris, and almanac
                 data for the GPS satellites;
             (2) Weather data, including temperature, barometric pressure, relative
                 humidity, precipitation rate, total precipitation, wind speed, and
                 wind direction.
             (3) Data from fixed Water Vapor Radiometers (WVR), which measure emission 
                 by water vapor in the atmosphere.  The WVR is part of normal DSN 
                 operations. At selected DSN stations, an advanced version (AWVR) 
                 measures emissions at 20.7 and 31.4 GHz along the line of sight to a
                 spacecraft being tracked. The AWVR is remotely operated for the DSN 
                 by the JPL Radar and Radio Science Systems Group (RRSSG) in Pasadena;
                 it is an element of a larger Advanced Media Calibration (AMC) system.
                 The AMC also includes a microwave temperature profiler and a sensitive
                 digital barometer. The AMC is capable of measuring the tropospheric 
                 relative frequency shift under summer conditions with a precision of 
                 better than 1e-14.
