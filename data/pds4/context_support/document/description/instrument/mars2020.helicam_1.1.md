            The Mars Helicopter, Ingenuity, is a technology demonstration
            designed to test the first powered flight on Mars. Ingenuity is
            a small, autonomous aircraft that will be carried to
            the surface of the Red Planet attached to the
            belly of the Perseverance rover. Its mission
            is experimental in nature and completely
            independent of the rover’s science mission.
            In the months after landing, the helicopter
            will be placed on the surface to test – for
            the first time ever – powered flight in the thin
            Martian air.
