SuperCam is an integrated multi-sensor remote-sensing instrument 
            carried aboard the Mars 2020 rover.  It implements four spectroscopic techniques 
            to remotely measure properties of materials on Mars.  These include:
            (1) Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), 
            (2) Raman spectroscopy, 
            (3) Time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy, and 
            (4)	Passive spectroscopy - Visible and Infrared spectrometer (VIS IR).
            SuperCam also includes a telescopic color context camera, the Remote Micro-Imager (RMI), 
            which is principally used to document the sites of remote spectroscopy measurements.  
            Finally, the instrument suite also includes a microphone, which is used primarily 
            to measure the pressure wave produced by the generation of plasma at a LIBS target.
