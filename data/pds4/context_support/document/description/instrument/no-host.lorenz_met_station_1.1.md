            A portable, compact meteorology station designed for dust devil field studies. The system used is based on the Gulf Coast Data Concepts B1100 pressure logger, 
            which combines a precision Bosch BMP085 pressure sensor (logged with resolution of 1 Pa or 0.01 mbar), with a microcontroller that logs pressure data and 
            housekeeping temperature as ASCII files on a 2GB microSD flash memory card. The whole unit operates as a large USB memory stick facilitating data transfer to
            a computer. Self-contained, power for remote operation is attained by usage of 2 alkaline D cell batteries, allowing unattended multi-month operation at sample
            rates of 2 Hz or more. The sensor and battery casing are installed in a plastic case, drilled to allow pressure equalization, with a painted exterior to minimize
            visibility. In some cases, the instrumentation may be augmented to include analog voltage (in range 0-4.19 V) with 12-bit resolution at an interval of 1s.
