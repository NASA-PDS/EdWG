The Sloan Digital Sky Survey Photometric Camera is a large-format mosaic CCD
consisting of two arrays, a photometric array using 30 2048x2048 SITe/Tektronix CCDs
with 24 micron pixels and an effective imaging area of 720 cm^2, and an astrometric
array that uses 24 400x2048 CCDs with the same pixel size, allowing the objects
imaged in the photometric camera to be tied to bright astrometric standard stars. 
The photometric detectors are arrayed in the focal plane in six columns of five chips
each such that two scans cover a filled stripe 2.5 degrees wide.
