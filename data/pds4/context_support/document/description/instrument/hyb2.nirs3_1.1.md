The Near Infrared Spectrometer (NIRS3) onboard the Hayabusa2 spacecraft is a point spectrometer that operates over the effective wavelength range of 1.8-3.2 micrometers with a 0.1 degree field-of-view. The 3 of the name NIRS3 comes from 3 micrometers. Around 3 micrometers, there are absorption lines of minerals with hydroxyl groups (OH). The primary goal of NIRS3 is to map the distribution of hydrated minerals on the target near-Earth asteroid (162173) Ryugu.
