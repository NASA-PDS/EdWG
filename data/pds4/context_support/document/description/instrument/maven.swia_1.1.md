         The Solar Wind Ion Analyzer (SWIA) is an electrostatic analyzer designed to measure solar 
         wind and magnetospheric ions in the Martian system over an energy/charge range of ~5-25000 
         eV/q, and an angular range of 360 x 90 degrees [minus spacecraft obstructions]. The SWIA 
         sensor is based on heritage from the Mars Global Surveyor Electron Reflectometer, Lunar 
         Prospector Electron Reflectometer, Wind 3dp, FAST ESA, and THEMIS ESA instruments. The 
         SWIA electronics are most directly based on those of THEMIS ESA, and the analyzer includes 
         new deflection optics in order to provide a large field of view on the 3-axis stabilized 
         MAVEN spacecraft. The SWIA sensor is mounted on the corner of the top deck of the spacecraft, 
         positioned to ensure a clear field of view over both sides of the solar panel. For the nominal 
         sun-pointed spacecraft orientation, the sensor is aligned such that the sun is centered in the 
         sensor field of view, with an unobstructed field of view around the nominal solar wind flow 
         direction.
