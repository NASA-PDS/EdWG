  ===================
    The High Field Fluxgate Magnetometer Experiment flown aboard the
    Pioneer 11 spacecraft was an extremely simple instrument used to
    extend the spacecraft's upper limit measurement capability by
    approximately an order of magnitude (from 0.14 mT to 1.00 mT) with
    minimum power and volume requirements. This magnetometer was
    designed to complement the low field measurements provided by a
    helium vector magnetometer and utilizes magnetic ring core sensors
    with bi-axial orthogonal sense coils. The instrument was a single
    range, triaxial fluxgate magnetometer capable of measuring fields of
    up to 1 mT along each orthogonal axis, with a maximum resolution of
    1 microTesla.
