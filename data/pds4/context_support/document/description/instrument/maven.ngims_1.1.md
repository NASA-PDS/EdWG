         The MAVEN Neutral Gas and Ion Mass Spectrometer (NGIMS) is a high sensitivity quadrupole
         mass spectrometer with a mass range of 2 to 150 Dalton and unit mass resolution. The sensor 
         of the NGIMS instrument has a high heritage from the Neutral Gas and Ion Mass Spectrometer 
         (NGIMS) developed for the CONTOUR mission and the Neutral Mass Spectrometer (NMS) developed 
         for the LADEE Mission. This mass spectrometer is similar to the Cassini Ion and Neutral Mass 
         Spectrometer (INMS) designed and developed at GSFC. The MAVEN NGIMS instrument was modified 
         from the heritage CONTOUR NGIMS instrument to increase the instrument sensitivity, field of 
         view and overall operational flexibility.
