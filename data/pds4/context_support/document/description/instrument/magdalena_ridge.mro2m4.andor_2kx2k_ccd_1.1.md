            This is an Andor 2kx2k CCD camera operating at -85 degrees Celsius. It has a GOS-calibrated
            shutter that permits highly accurate astrometry (typical residual less than +/-0.20) for 
            objects moving many hundreds of arcseconds per minute. The camera control computer is
            synched once per minute wot a GPS coordinated Network Time Protocol server to account for
            any hardware-induced errors.
