The UVS instrument carried aboard the LADEE mission performed spectral
characterization of the lunar atmosphere, including gases and dust at several
wavelengths.  This characterization entailed measuring the relative
concentrations of certain species, including Na and K, and noting the spatial
and temporal distributions of those species.
