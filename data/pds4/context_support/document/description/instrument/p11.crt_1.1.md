  ===================
    The cosmic ray telescope used for this experiment was also designed
    to monitor solar and galactic cosmic rays and track the twisting
    high energy particles from the Sun. The instrument can determine
    which of the nuclei of the ten lightest elements make up these
    cosmic ray particles. Before saturation by radiation, the cosmic ray
    telescope measured high energy particles in Jupiter's radiation
    belts.
 
    The instrument consists of three, three-element, solid-state
    telescopes. The high energy telescope measures the flux of protons
    between 56 and 800 MeV. The medium energy telescope measures protons
    with energies between 3 and 22 MeV, and identifies the ten elements
    from hydrogen to neon. The low energy telescope measures the flux of
    electrons between .05 and 1 MeV, and of protons between .05 and 20
    MeV.
