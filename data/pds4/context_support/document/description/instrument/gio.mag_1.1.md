      Instrument Overview
      ===================
      The Giotto Magnetometer Experiment consisted of a triaxial and separate
      biaxial system of fluxgate sensors of the ring-core type, the
      associated analog electronics and a digital processor.  Because of the
      dust hazard near closest approach to comet 1P/Halley (the target of the
      original Giotto mission), a magnetometer boom could not be included in
      the spacecraft design.  The resulting magnetic contamination problem
      was addressed by the use of the two magnetometers and by a magnetic
      cleanliness program.
 
      For details on the instrument design and operation, see the article
      from ESA publication SP-1077 specifically concerning the magnetometer.
