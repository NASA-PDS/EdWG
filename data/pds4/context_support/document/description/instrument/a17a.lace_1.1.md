              The Apollo 17 Lunar Atmospheric Composition Experiment (LACE) was a miniature magnetic
              deflection mass spectrometer designed to study the composition and variations in the
              lunar atmosphere. Part of the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package (ALSEP), LACE
              was deployed on the lunar surface and oriented to intercept and measure the downward
              flux of gases.
