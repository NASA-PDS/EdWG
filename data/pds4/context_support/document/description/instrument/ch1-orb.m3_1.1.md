  Instrument Overview
  ===================
    The Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3) was a near-infrared imaging
    spectrometer of the pushbroom type on-board the Indian Space
    Research Organization's (ISRO) Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft that
    launched on 22 October 2008.  M3 measured the spectral range from
    430 to 3000 nm, had a 40-km-wide field of view from a 100-km orbit,
    and operated in a high resolution (70 m/pixel) target mode or a
    lower resolution (140 m/pixel) global mode.
 
    Originally scheduled to make target and global observations from a
    100-km circular polar obit for two years, the first M3 imaging data
    were acquired on 18 and 19 November 2008 using both the global and
    target imaging modes.  Several days later on 22 November, M3 acquired
    its first scientific images of Oriental Basin.  Data acquisition from
    the 100-km primary science orbit continued into May 2009.  On 19 May,
    the Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft was raised to a 200-km to compensate for
    star tracker failures and orbiter temperatures that were higher than
    expected.  On 28 August 2009 ISRO abruptly lost radio contact with the
    Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft and officially terminated the mission three
    days later.  After ten months in operation, M3 had obtained over 4.6
    billion spectra of the lunar surface, and its low resolution spatial
    coverage encompassed nearly the entire Moon.
 
    The instrument was funded by NASA's Discovery Mission of Opportunity
    program and was designed, built, and tested by a partnership between
    Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Brown University, USA.  Preliminary
    results are presented by Pieters, et al. (2009b) [PIETERSETAL2009B]
    and Pieters, et al. (2009c) [PIETERSETAL2009C].
 
 
  Instrument Characteristics
  ==========================
    M3 was a near-infrared imaging spectrometer with a compact system of
    optics in the Offner design which produces little or not optical
    distortion, either spatially or spectrally.  The instrument included
    a robust on-board calibrator and was cooled by a multi-stage passive
    cooler.
 
    M3 was designed to operate in two distinct modes. The target mode was
    used for full resolution imaging of specific science targets, and the
    global mode was used for low resolution global imaging.  M3 used a
    pushbroom method in which the field of view was passively swept through
    the lunar scene below it, along a line perpendicular to the slit,
    simultaneously exposing all 600 spatial pixels in an entire row using
    260 spectral channels (in target mode).
 
    The characteristics of the instrument are summarized here:

  Scientific Objectives
  =====================
    The specific scientific objectives of the M3 instrument were to:
 
    - Evaluate the primary components of the lunar crust and their
      distribution across the highlands,
 
    - Characterize the diversity and extent of the different types of
      basaltic volcanism,
 
    - Identify and access deposits containing volatiles including water,
 
    - Map fresh craters to access the properties of impacts in the
      recent past, and
 
    - Identify and evaluate concentrations of unusual and unexpected
      minerals.
