            The Bruker Quantax XFlash 4010 SSD EDX detector is an attachment for the Hitachi S5500 Field-Emission SEM, which enables the chemical analysis of both thin and bulk sample 
            areas. This detector allows for energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy of samples excited by the SEM electron beam. The energy of the x-ray emissions from the excited sample 
            is unique to different elements and the intensity of the emission lines is converted to abundance using the interactive oxide quantification algorithm in the Bruker ESPRIT 
            software, following background subtraction and peak deconvolution.  Available EDX modes are line scanning and 2D mapping.
