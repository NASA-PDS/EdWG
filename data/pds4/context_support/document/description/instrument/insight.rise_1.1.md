The RISE instrument utilizes the X-band telecommunications capability of the InSight 
            lander in combination with the coherent Doppler tracking equipment at the Deep Space Network 
            (DSN) to perform radio science experiments to determine the precession and nutation of the 
            Martian spin axis.
