The Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure (SEIS) on InSight will collect
            precise measurements of quakes and other internal activity on Mars to better understand
            the planet's internal structure and meteorite flux. The instrument includes two independent
            3-axis seismometers: a Very Broad Band (VBB) and a Short Period (SP) seismometer. The
            instrument package is deployed onto the surface and is covered by a thermal and wind shield
            to protect the instrument from thermal and wind induced noise. The package is connected
            to the lander by a flexible cable tether.
