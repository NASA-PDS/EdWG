The DENIS (Deep European Near-Infrared southern sky Survey) 
instrument is made up of a 3-channel camera built of commercially
 available detector arrays by the Observatoire de Paris and with 
major contributions from other European Institutes, notably: the 
IAS in Frascati, the Observatoire de Grenoble, the University of Innsbruck, the
Observatoire de Lyon, and the IAC in Tenerife. The instrument was used for the DENIS
survey at the ESO 1.0 meter telescope at La Silla, Chile.
