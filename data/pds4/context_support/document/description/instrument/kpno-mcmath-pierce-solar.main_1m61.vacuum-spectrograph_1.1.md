            The third mirror of the McMath-Pierce main telescope sends light down into the observing room can be moved above three different positions. 
            Two of these have a vacuum spectrograph beneath them, one of 18 meter deep and the other 4 meter deep with lower resolution but higher light
            throughput. These two spectrographs are able to rotate to compensate for the rotation of the image caused by the use of a heliostat. 
            The third position can only be equipped with a static optical table with no image rotation correction and is therefore rarely used.
