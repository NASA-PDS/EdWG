The Touch-and-Go Camera Suite (TAGCAMS) consists of three similar camera heads, each suited
         for a particular purpose. The Navigation Camera (NavCam) is a wide-angle framing camera used for 
         optical navigation. The Natural Feature Tracking Camera NFTCam) is a second framing camera used for 
         landmark identification and autonomous feature tracking to aid in sample acquisition. Finally, the 
         Stowage Camera (StowCam) is used to document the insertion of the sample collection head into the Sample 
         Return Capsule (SRC). The OSIRIS-REx Science Processing and Operation Center located at the University 
         of Arizona produces these data products and distributes them to the OSIRIS-REx Flight Dynamics Team, the 
         Lockheed Martin Mission Support Area, the Science Team and the Planetary Data System.
