The OSIRIS-REx Camera Suite (OCAMS) is a set of three cameras designed to support the mission through
         all phases, from approach to sample collection. The asteroid is first acquired through the PolyCam, an 8” 
         Ritchey-Chretien telescope capable of detecting up to 12th magnitude objects limited by spacecraft jitter. As features
         on the asteroid become resolvable, PolyCam is used for preliminary mapping at a surface resolution of less 
         than twenty-five cm. MapCam performs mapping at a suite of phase angles using a panchromatic and four color filters. 
         The color filters are the b’, v, w, and x-bands, which, except for the b’ filter, are similar in bandwidth to the 
         ECAS filter set used by ground-based astronomers. Several major survey campaigns are conducted with both 
         the MapCam and PolyCam to select and characterize potential sample sites on Bennu. Reconnaissance sample site 
         flyover sorties provide centimeter and sub-centimeter scale Polycam images to provide both context and confirmation of 
         TAGSAM (Touch And Go Sample Acquisition Mechanism) ingestable material. The final sampling sequence is documented by 
         the wide-field SamCam and gives the context for the recovered sample. All cameras use identical detector arrays with
         different focal lengths separated by a factor of 5. The 3 cameras in the instrument suite provide overlapping 
         capabilities and are functionally redundant [Rizk et al. 2018].
