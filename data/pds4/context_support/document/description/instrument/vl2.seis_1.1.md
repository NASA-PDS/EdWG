            The Viking Seismic Experiment was intended to
            observe ground motion on the surface of Mars and thereby determine the
            level of seismic activity on Mars, and deduce crustal properties and
            internal structure. It comprised a three-axis seismometer and data
            handling unit. The unit was mounted on the deck of each of the
            two Viking landers.
