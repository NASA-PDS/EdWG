            Micro-Raman spectra for this project were obtained by the Center for Planetary Exploration at 
            Stony Brook University using a a WiTec alpha300R confocal imaging system equipped with 532 nm 
            neodymium: yttrium/aluminum/garnet (Nd:YAG) laser with 2.24 mW nominal power at the sample 
            surface, and a 50X (NA = 0.8) objective (spot size of 763 nm). Each analysis consisted of 240 
            one-second integrations that were averaged. For Raman and micro-FTIR spot analyses, multiple 
            locations were analyzed per sample.
