EFOSC2 is a focal reducer multi-mode instrument using multi-layer coated
all-transmission optics. It is permanently mounted at the Nasmyth B focus of the
3.58m New Technology Telescope. The wavelength range of operation is between 305nm
and 1100nm. The field of view is 4.1'x4.1'.

It has been in operation since 1989.

The detector (CCD#40) is a Loral/Lesser, thinned, AR coated, UV flooded, MPP chip
controlled by ESO-FIERA. It's size is 2048 x 2048 pixel, the pixel size being
15mux15mu, or 0.12"x0.12" on the sky. The 2x2 binned pixels of the default CCD
readout modes will be projected to 0".24 on the sky.
