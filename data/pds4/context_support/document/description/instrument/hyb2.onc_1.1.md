The Optical Navigation Camera (ONC) system onboard the Hayabusa2 spacecraft consists of one telescopic camera (ONC-T) and two wide-angle cameras (ONC-W1 and ONC-W2). The ONC-T is a telescopic camera with seven band-pass filters in the visible and near-infrared range. These filters are placed on a wheel, which rotates to put a selected filter for different observations, enabling multi-band imaging.
