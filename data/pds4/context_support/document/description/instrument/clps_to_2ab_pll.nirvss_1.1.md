            The Near Infrared Volatiles Spectrometer System (NIRVSS) is an instrument system designed to measure the millimeter-scale morphology, 
            spectral signature, and temperature of lunar surface materials. It consists of the Ames Imaging Module (AIM) with configurable LED 
            illumination, a dual-channel near infrared point spectrometer (SPC) with a lamp to enable spectral observations of shadowed regions, 
            and the Longwave Calibration Sensor (LCS).
