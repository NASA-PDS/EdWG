  The Large Cassegrain Spectrometer (LCS) sits at the Cassegrain
  f/17.7 focus of the 2.7m Harlan J. Smith telescope. The web site
  above provides this general description:

    A low-to-moderate-resolution spectrometer (R = 600-2,500)
    for faint object work available with TI1 and CC1 CCDs.
    Various gratings provide wavelength coverage from 0.3 to
    1.1 microns.  The LCS has long slit (150 arcsec) capability
    and CCD-based guiding and acquisition.  Limiting magnitude
    m[v]=20.
