CCD imager with a Tektronik 2kx2k chip with 24micron pixels.              
                                                                           
 Characteristics are:                                                      
 DIGITAL LIMITATION                       : 65,534                         
 BIAS LEVEL                               : ~1000                          
 NOISE,  e-/RMS                           : 4.0                            
 DEFAULT GAIN, e/A                        :  3.6                           
 LINEARITY,0.1%, e-                       : ~180,000                       
 LINEARITY,1.0%, e-                       : ~190,000                       
 INTERNAL RADIATION EVENT RATE, EVENTS/HR : ~2700                          
 DARK CURRENT, e-/hr/pix                  : 4-5                            
                                                                           
 At the 2.1m with f/7.5, this give a FOV of 10.4' x 10.4'                  
 with a pixel scale of 0.305'/pix.
