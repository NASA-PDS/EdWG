LIDAR, LIght Detection And Ranging, is a laser altimeter onboard Hayabusa2 spacecraft. LIDAR is part of navigation system of spacecraft, but it can be used for scientific instrument.  By measuring distance to surface of (162173) Ryugu will enable us to acquire spacecraft position information and topography of (162173) Ryugu, and derive albedo using measured intensity of reflected light by (162173) Ryugu. LIDAR also has dust count mode and mode for laser link experiment.
