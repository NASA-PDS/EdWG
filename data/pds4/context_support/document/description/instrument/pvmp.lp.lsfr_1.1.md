    ===================
 
      The objective of this investigation was to determine the regions in Venus' atmosphere where solar energy is deposited. 
      Six narrow-field-of-view detectors were used to measure the intensity of scattered solar light. As the probe descended 
      through the atmosphere, the difference between upward-looking and downward-looking detectors indicated the net downward 
      flux.
