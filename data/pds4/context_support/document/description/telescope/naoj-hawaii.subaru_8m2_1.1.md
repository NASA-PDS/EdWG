            The Subaru Telescope is a Ritchey-Chretien reflecting telescope. Instruments can be mounted at a Cassegrain focus
            below the primary mirror; at either of two Nasmyth focal points in enclosures on the sides of the telescope mount, 
            to which light can be directed with a tertiary mirror; or at the prime focus in lieu of a secondary mirror, an 
            arrangement rare on large telescopes, to provide a wide field of view suited to deep wide-field surveys.
            
            Longitude and latitude, above, are provided in the NAD83 coordinate system. Altitude elevation axis is at 4163 m.
            Telescope size measures 22.2 m in height, with a maximum width of 27.2 m, weighing 555 t. The primary mirror 
            has an effective diameter of 8.2 m with a thickness of 22 cm weighing 22.8 t. Composed of ULE (ultra-low thermal
            expansion glass), the mean surface error is 14 nm, with a focal length of 15 m. Various foci are as follows: 
            primary focus is F/2.0 (with corrector); Cassegrain focus is F/12.2; Nasmyth foci are F/12.6 (optical) and F/13.6
            (infrared). All is contained within a cylindrical enclosure rotating with telescope, with a height of 43 m and 
            diameter at the base of 40 m, weighing 2000 t.
