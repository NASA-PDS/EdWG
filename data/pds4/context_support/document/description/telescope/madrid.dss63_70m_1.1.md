           This fully steerable telescope is a parabolic reflector radio antenna that is part of
           the NASA Deep Space Network.  It was first operational in 1974 with a 64-m aperture. The
           aperture was extended to 70-m in the mid-1980s to support the Voyager 2 encounter with
           Neptune. The 70-m antenna can receive at frequencies between about 1.6 and 32, and it
           can transmit up to 20 kW at 2.1 and 7.4 GHz, though the former is limited to emergency 
           use by agreement with the Spanish gvernment. Antenna coordinates were converted from 
           Table 5 in module 301 (revision L) of the DSN Telecommunications Link Design Handbook 
           (DSN document 810-005).
           
           The Madrid Deep Space Communications Complex (MDSCC) is located about 65 km west of Madrid,
           near the town of Robledo de Chevala, Spain.  Under a 1964 agreement between the governments
           of Spain and the United States, the National Institute for Aerospace Technology (INTA) 
           managed the 70-m antenna during its early years. The creation, in 1992, of the state-owned 
           Aerospace Engineering and Services, SA (INSA, S.A.), under INTA, allowed the concentration 
           of these responsibilities in the new company. INSA has since disappeared and Ingeniería de 
           Sistemas para la Defensa de España has managed MDSCC since December 2012.
