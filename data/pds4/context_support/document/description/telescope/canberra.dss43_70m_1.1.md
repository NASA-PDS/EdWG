           This fully steerable telescope is a parabolic reflector radio antenna that is part of 
           the NASA Deep Space Network.  It was first operational in 1972 with a 64-m aperture. The
           aperture was extended to 70-m in 1987 to support the Voyager 2 encounter with Neptune.
           
           The antenna can receive at frequencies between about 1.6 and 8.6 GHz in left-circular
           polarization (LCP); over 2.0-8.6 GHz it can receive simultaneously in RCP. It can transmit
           up to 100 kW at 2.1 GHz (S-band) and up to 20 kW at 7.1 GHz (X-band). Antenna coordinates
           were converted from Table 5 in module 301 (revision L) of the DSN Telecommunications Link 
           Design Handbook (DSN document 810-005).
           
           The Canberra Deep Space Communications Complex (CDSCC) is managed by the Commonwealth 
           Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), Australia's national science 
           research agency. The CDSCC is at Tidbinbilla, about 35 km southwest of Canberra, ACT.
