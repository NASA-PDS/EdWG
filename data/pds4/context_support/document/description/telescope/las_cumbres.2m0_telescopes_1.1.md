            The 2m telescopes of the Las Cumbres global network are built to be identical. They are
            Altitude-Azimuth mounted Ritchey-Chretian Cassegrain telescopes. Users should consult 
            the data product documentation to determine which telescope was used to record any 
            specific observation when that information is needed.
