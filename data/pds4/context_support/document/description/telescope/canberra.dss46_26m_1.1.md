            DSS-46 was used primarily for communication with Earth orbiting spacecraft and for
            initial acquisition of any spacecraft immediately after launch. It partnered with
            DSS-16 (at Goldstone, CA) and DSS-66 (near Madrid, Spain) in a 26-m subnet for
            this purpose.  DSS-46 could transmit 50-2000 W at 2.1 GHz (S-band).  It could receive
            right- and left-circularly polarized signals simultaneously at both 2.3 GHz and 8.4 GHz; 
            its receiver could combine the signals to obtain a rotatable linear polization. 
            
            The antenna was constructed in 1965 at the Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station in
            Australia to support the Apollo missions. On 21 July 1969 (Australian time) the 
            antenna received and relayed to the world the first television images of Neil 
            Armstrong's historic first steps on the Moon. The Honeysuckle Creek station was 
            converted for use in NASA's Deep Space Network after the end of the Apollo and 
            Skylab programs, with the antenna given the new designation DSS-44. The antenna 
            supported many missions, including those to Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and the Sun,
            until the closure of the Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station in December 1981.  In 
            1983 the antenna was moved to its current location at Tidbinbilla, re-designated 
            DSS-46 and modified to expand its capabilities for early launch acquisition (tracking
            a spacecraft after it has launched from Earth).  The antenna continued to support 
            NASA and international missions studying the Sun, Earth, Moon and the planets in 
            our solar system until its retirement from deep space service in December 2009.
            
            The Canberra Deep Space Communications Complex (CDSCC) is managed by the Commonwealth 
            Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), Australia's national science 
            research agency. The CDSCC is at Tidbinbilla, about 35 km southwest of Canberra, ACT.
