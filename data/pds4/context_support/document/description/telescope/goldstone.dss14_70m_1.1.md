           This fully steerable telescope is a parabolic radio/radar antenna that is part of the NASA
           Deep Space Network (DSN). DSS-14 was first operational in 1964 with a 64-m aperture, supporting
           the Mariner 4 flyby of Mars; as a result, it was subsequently known as "Mars Station".
           Its aperture was extended to 70-m in 1988 to support the Voyager 2 encounter with
           Neptune.  The antenna can receive at frequencies between about 1.6 and 8.6 GHz in left-circular
           polarization (LCP); over 2.0-8.6 GHz it can receive simultaneously in both LCP and right-circular
           polarization (RCP). It can transmit up to 20 kW at selected frequencies in the 2-8 GHz range.  
           DSS-14 is used occasionally as part of the Goldstone Solar System Radar, which has more powerful
           transmitters. Antenna coordinates were converted from Table 5 in module 301 (revision L) of 
           the DSN Telecommunications Link Design Handbook (DSN document 810-005).
