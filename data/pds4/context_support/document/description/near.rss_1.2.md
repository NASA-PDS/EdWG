 The NEAR Radio Science Subsystem (RSS) used a coherent X-band transponder to conduct a 
 radio science investigation by measuring the Doppler shift from the spacecraft's radial           
 velocity component relative to the Earth.  Accurate measurements of the Doppler shift 
 and the range to Earth as the spacecraft orbited Eros allowed mapping of the asteroid's         
 gravity field. In conjunction with MSI/NIS and NLR data, gravity determinations were 
 combined with global shape and rotation data to constrain the internal density structure 
 of Eros and search for heterogeneity.  Spacecraft tracking data for the radio science 
 experiment were also obtained for a mass determination of Asteroid 253 Mathilde.
