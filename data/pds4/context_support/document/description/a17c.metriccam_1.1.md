The Apollo 17 Metric (Mapping) Camera obtained high-quality metric photographs, on black and white film, with high geometric precision of the lunar surface from lunar orbit combined with time-correlated stellar photography for selenodetic/cartographic control. A laser altimeter was operated with it. The Metric Camera also provided supporting photographic data for the Scientific Instrument Module (SIM) Panoramic Camera and other Command Service Module (CSM) photographic experiments. Approximately 2350 of the 3298 Apollo 17 Metric Camera frames contain imagery of the lunar surface.
