The Hayabusa spacecraft was successfully launched on May 9, 2003 as apart of the Hayabusa mission. The HAYABUSA
            spacecraft is box-shaped with approximate dimensions of 1.5 x 1.2 x 1.2
            meters.  Two solar panels with a combined area of 12 square meter provide power for the spacecraft including the four ion engines.. Aboard the space craft were four science instruments. 
            These instruments are the science camera (AMICA); the surface hopper (MINERVA); the near infrared and x-ray spectrometers (NIRS, XRS); the 
            Lidar altimeter (LIDAR); and the sample collection and return systems.
