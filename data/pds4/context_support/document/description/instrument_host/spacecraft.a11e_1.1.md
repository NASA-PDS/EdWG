    precursor to the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package (ALSEP). The
    EASEP were the first experiments set up on the moon. EASEP 
    experiments included a laser ranging retroreflector, a passive 
    seismic experiment, a solar wind composition experiment, and a lunar 
    dust detector.
