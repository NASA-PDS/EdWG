The InSight Deployment Camera (IDC) instrument has a narrow angle lens and is mounted near the elbow of the robotic arm. It can be articulated by
            moving the arm and elbow. Stereo imagery is achieved by taking a pair of images with known separation and sufficient overlap. The IDC’s optics are based on 
            Mars Science Laboratory’s Navcam instrument. Images from the IDC are structured the same as images from the InSight Context Camera (ICC), and are treated 
            similarly by both the flight software (FSW) and the ground system (GDS).
