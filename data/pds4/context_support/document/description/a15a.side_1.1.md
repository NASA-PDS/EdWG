              Apollo 15 Suprathermal Ion Detector Experiment (SIDE) measured the energies and masses
              of positive ions reaching the lunar surface, including magnetospheric ions and those
              generated from ultraviolet ionization of the lunar atmosphere and from the
              free-streaming solar wind/lunar surface interaction.
