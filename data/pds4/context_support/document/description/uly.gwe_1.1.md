    Abstract.  -- Since the optimum size of a gravitational wave
    detector is the wave length, interplanetary dimensions are
    needed for the mHz band of interest.  Doppler tracking of
    Ulysses will provide the most sensitive attempt to date at the
    detection of gravitational waves in the low frequency band.
    The driving noise source is the fluctuations in the refractive
    index of interplanetary plasma.  This dictates the timing of
    the experiment to be near solar opposition and sets the target
    accuracy for the fractional frequency change at 3.0 x 10^-14
    for integration times of the order of 1000 sec.  The
    instrumentation utilized by the experiment is distributed
    between the radio systems on the spacecraft and the seven
    participating ground stations of the Deep Space Network and
    Medicina.  Preliminary analysis is available of the
    measurements taken during the Ulysses first opposition test.
