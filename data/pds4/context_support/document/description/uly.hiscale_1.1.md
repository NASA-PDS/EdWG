  ===================
    (excerpted from: [LANZEROTTIETAL1992])
 
    Abstract.  -- The Heliosphere Instrument for Spectra,
    Composition, and Anisotropy at Low Energies (HI-SCALE) is
    designed to make measurements of interplanetary ions and
    electrons throughout the entire Ulysses mission.  The ions (Ei
    >50 keV) and electrons (Ee >30 keV) are identified uniquely and
    detected by five separate solid-state detector telescopes that
    are oriented to give nearly complete pitch-angle coverage
    (i.e., coverage of essentially 4 [pi] ster) from the spinning
    spacecraft.  Ion elemental abundances are determined by a delta
    E vs E telescope using a thin (5 [micrometer]) front solid
    state detector element in a three-element telescope.
    Experiment operation is controlled by a microprocessor-based
    data system.  Inflight calibration is provided by radioactive
    sources mounted on telescope covers which can be closed for
    calibration purposes and for radiation protection during the
    course of the mission.  Ion and electron spectral information
    is determined using both broad-energy-range rate channels and a
    32 channel pulse-height analyser (channels spaced
    logarithmically) for more detailed spectra.  The instrument
    weighs 5.775 kg and uses 4.0 W of power.  Some initial
    in-ecliptic measurements are presented which demonstrate the
    features of the instrument.
