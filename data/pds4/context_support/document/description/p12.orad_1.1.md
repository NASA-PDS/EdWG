    Instrument Description
    ======================
      The Pioneer Venus radar mapper consisted of a 38 cm antenna and
      a radar transmitter/receiver, and was flown on the Pioneer 12
      orbiter.  It functioned continuously from December 5th 1978
      until March 23 1981 when it was switched off because spacecraft
      periapsis had risen to such an extent that no further useful
      data could be obtained.  The antenna could be rotated in one
      plane by means of a stepping motor that was commanded by the
      radar system.  During a periapsis pass, the antenna was moved
      so that it pointed to the nadir at some point during each 12
      second spacecraft rotation period.  The radar was loaded from
      the ground with approximately 200 commands before each mapping
      pass, and then operated automatically.  The commands included
      interpolation coefficients that set the altimeter range window,
      the receiver band-pass filter, and the receiver gain.  The
      instrument was capable of making up to 8 observations during
      each 12 second period: space calibration, 1 or 4 altimetry
      measurements, 0, 1 or 2 imaging measurements, and a planet
      calibration.  The number of altimetry and image measurements
      depended on spacecraft altitude and the downlink bandwidth
      allotted to the radar instrument.  Initial altimetry and
      imaging data processing was performed on-board.  Altimetry
      echoes were detected, sampled, and correlated against the
      transmitted waveform, a shift-register sequence, and sub-summed
      for repeated pulses.  Imaging echoes were detected, sampled,
      and Fourier transformed to achieve azimuth resolution.
 
 
    Science Objectives
    ==================
      The radar mapper was designed to obtain a near global picture
      of the topography, meter-scale surface slopes and reflectivity
      of Venus.  Constraints imposed by the choice of orbit limited
      the radar coverage to a latitude band lying between 74 degrees
      N and 61 degrees S completely around the planet.  In addition
      to the altimetry objectives, the experiment sought an image of
      the radar scattering properties of the surface at oblique
      incidence.  Sensitivity limited the imaged region to a band
      around the planet lying between 45 degrees N and 10 degrees S.
      Altimetric error was less than 200 meters; altimetric surface
      'footprint' size varied from about 10 km in diameter at a
      spacecraft altitude of 200 km, to 50 km at a maximum altitude
      of 4700 km.  Imaging resolution varied from 20 to 40 km,
      depending on spacecraft altitude.
 
 
    Operational Considerations
    ==========================
      (1) Shortly after it began operating, a failure was observed in
      telemetry from the instrument that affected all altimetric and
      imaging data.  This was traced to a circuit failure in the data
      formatter sub-system, and was totally eliminated by operating
      the radar on a shortened duty cycle, viz.  that all power to
      the radar was switched off except for a 2 hour period each day.
      This proved entirely successful, although about 36 days of data
      were lost while the problem was being diagnosed.  (2) It was
      originally intended that, when the radar was performing 4
      altimetry measurements per spacecraft rotation period, they
      should be made with varying receiver frequencies, thereby
      'squinting' the altimeter footprints ahead of, and behind, the
      nadir point.  This proved to be unwise, since the squinted
      echoes had very low signal strength, so, after approximately 3
      months of operation, the radar was commanded no to vary the
      receiver frequency and the 4 altimeter measurements represented
      essentially the same surface footprint.
 
 
    Calibration Description
    =======================
      The instrument was calibrated by means of a radar target
      simulator that was specially built by Hughes, and end-to-end
      tests of the radar system were conducted on several occasions,
      including the on-stand test shortly prior to launch.  The
      results were published in the Hughes instrument manual.  In
      Venus orbit, the instrument was calibrated once per 12 second
      spacecraft rotation period by recording the receiver voltage at
      that time when the antenna pointed to the zenith, i.e.  to cold
      sky.

      Description
      -----------
        Transmitter and receiver use the same detector: a 13 cm
        linearly polarized short-backfire antenna.  The 3dB one-way
        beamwidth is 29 degrees in the E-plane and 25 degrees in the
        H plane.  In normal operation, the E-field is tangent to the
        Venus surface and the H-field is normal to the Venus surface.
        The antenna is mounted on the periphery of the instrument
        bay, at an azimuth of 45 degrees relative to the spacecraft
        X-axis.  It is articulated in one direction and moves under
        control of a stepping motor commanded by the radar command
        processor.
 
 
      Sensitivity
      -----------
        Measured antenna gain was 17 dB.  The first sidelobe was 16
        dB less than peak, and the sidelobe level at 90 degrees was
        29 dB relative to peak.  3dB beamwidth was 29 degrees for the
        E-plane and 25 degrees for the H-plane.
