          Located at Trent University, Peterborough, Ontario, Canada, in the School of the Environment, the Trent Environmental Wind Tunnel 
          Research Group is managed by Dr. Cheryl MeKenna Neuman. The lab houses the Trent Environmental Wind Tunnel (TEWT) with funds provided
          by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council, Canadian Foundation for Innovation (CFI) and Trent University (TU-NSRC).
          In 1997, the present site was established in the current climate-controlled laboratory in the Environmental Sciences Building. The
          laboratory was established with the purpose of studying fluid mechanics of aeolian transport and associated sediment erosion and 
          deposition, simulating processes within the atmospheric boundary layer.
