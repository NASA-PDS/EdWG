          and is managed by Dr. David A. Williams of the School of Earth and Space Exploration at 
          Arizona State University. The facility consists of the tower test facility (Bldg. N242) and 
          associated wind tunnels and other devices that can be used under Earth ambient pressures as
          well as various lower pressure environments (including Mars analog) making use of the Ames 
          vacuum facility for atmospheric pump downs of the test chamber.
