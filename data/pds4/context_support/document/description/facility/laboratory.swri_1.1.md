            For more than three decades, Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) has been a recognized leader in space science research as well as in the development of spacecraft 
            instrumentation, avionics and electronics for both government and industry. A traditional strength of the Space Science Division is the design and fabrication of instruments 
            for the in-situ measurement of space plasmas, the dilute ionized gases that populate the immediate space environments of the Earth and other solar system bodies as well as 
            interplanetary space.
