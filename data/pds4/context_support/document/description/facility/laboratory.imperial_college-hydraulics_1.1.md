          Historical laboratory from the early 1900s used for sediment transport studies from hydrodynamic and aeolian tunnels and flumes.
          In 1935, Prof. C.M. White a civil engineer made space for the R.A.Bagnold's wooden wind tunnel. The lab pursued fundamental research 
          into such topics as wave-pressures, sediment transport, spillway design, pipe and channel friction, cavitation, drag forces and flood predictions.
