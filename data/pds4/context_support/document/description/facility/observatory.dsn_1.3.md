            NOTE: Investigations like radio science that treat the DSN as one entity use this.
            Else, investigations that distinguish Canberra, Goldstone, and Madrid should use

            The NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) comprises three Deep Space Communications Complexes (DSCCs)
            spaced by approximately 120 degrees in longitude and within about 40 degrees latitude
            of Earth's equator. As the Earth rotates, this configuration provides nearly continuous 
            coverage of spacecraft in the ecliptic -- that is, spacecraft flying to or orbiting most 
            solar system objects.
            
            The Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex (GDSCC) is near Barstow, California (USA);
            it is managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, CA.  The Canberra Deep 
            Space Communications Complex (CDSCC) is in Tidbinbilla, ACT (Australia), near Canberra; 
            it is managed by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation.  The 
            Madrid Deep Space Communication Complex (MDSCC) is in Robledo de Chevala, near Madrid,
            Spain; it is operated by Instituto Nacional de TÃ©cnica Aeroespacial.  
            
            Each DSCC includes several Deep Space Stations (DSSs, or antennas), a Signal Processing 
            Center (SPC), and administrative and support facilities.  Each DSCC handles several types 
            of data including: frequency and timing, tracking, telemetry, command, monitor, radio science, 
            and very long baseline interferometry. These data types support uplink (to spacecraft) or 
            downlink (from spacecraft) operations or passive reception.
            
            Data received from spacecraft are relayed via the local SPC to the Network Operations Control
            Center (NOCC) at JPL in Pasadena, where they are distributed to the offices responsible for 
            each spacecraft.  Commands, generated in those offices, are sent via the NOCC, SPC, and
            DSS to the spacecraft.
            
            The antennas are divided according to aperture size into subnets.  DSS 14 became operational
            in 1964 so that it could support the Mariner 4 flyby of Mars; it and the other two 64-m 
            antennas were upgraded to 70-m in the 1980s to support the Voyager 2 flyby of Neptune.
            Its other capabilities have evolved over time.  The smaller antennas have become
            operational at various times, and their capabilities have also evolved; some antennas are
            no longer in service.  Readers interested in specifics should consult documentation
            appropriate to the time of interest (for example, the 810-005 Design Handbook).  The
            following list provides only a snapshot of capabilities over time:

            DSS 14 is part of the Goldstone Solar System Radar, a fully steerable radar capable of 
            operating in both monostatic and bistatic modes (with cooperating second antennas) for the
            study of solar system objects.
            
            Each complex includes instrumentation which collects meteorological, tropospheric, and ionospheric 
            data used to calibrate radiometric measurements at the DSCC.
