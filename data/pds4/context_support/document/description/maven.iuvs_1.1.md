         IUVS is an imaging ultraviolet spectrograph which simultaneously images far ultraviolet (FUV) and
         middle ultraviolet (MUV) spectra onto paired Hamatsu V5180M image intensifiers with Cypress 
         CYIH1SM1000AA-HHCS CMOS array detectors. Second order (110-190nm) light from the beamsplitter is 
         measured by the FUV detector (with a CsI photocathode and MgF2 window) while first-order (180-340 
         nm) light is transmitted to the MUV detector (with a CsTe photocathode and synthetic silica window). 
         A spectral resolution of 0.6 nm and 1.2 nm is achieved for the FUV and MUV, respectively.
