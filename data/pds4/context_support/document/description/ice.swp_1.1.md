    ===================
      The plasma electron analyzer is a 90deg,
      spherical-section electrostatic analyzer.
      Electrons from secondary emitters are coupled into
      a discrete-dynode electron multiplier to provide
      spatial resolution in polar and azimuth angles.
      Electrons having 5<E(e)< 1500 eV are analyzed in 16
      steps.  A complete two-dimensional distribution is
      obtained in one spacecraft revolution and is read
      out every 24 s at 1024 bit/s.
