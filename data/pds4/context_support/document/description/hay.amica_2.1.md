The Asteroid Multi-Band Imaging Camera (AMICA) is one of the Optical        
            Navigation Cameras (ONCs) of the Hayabusa mission, a Japanese-led           
            sample-return mission to the asteroid 25143 Itokawa.  The three ONCs are    
            AMICA (also known as ONC-T), and two wide angle navigation cameras ONC-W1   
            and ONC-W2.  The AMICA system was used both for science and for optical     
            navigation.
