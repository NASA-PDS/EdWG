    ===================
 
      The dust mass spectrometer measures the chemical
      composition, the size and the spatial density of
      solid particles using a time-of-flight technique,
      with particular emphasis on the determination of
      the Li, C and B isotopic ratios.  The operating
      Principle of PUMA, illustrated in Figure 8a, is
      similar to that of the PIA instrument flown on
      Giotto.  The dust particles enter through a baffle
      and impact on a silver target (M) at a speed of 78
      km/s.  The particles and a certain amount of the
      target material are vaporized and partly ionized.
      The two Vega spacecraft have different targets; one
      type is mounted in a cartridge as in the PIA, the
      second has a corrugated surface such that a larger
      amount of projectile ions enter the analyzer.  The
      target is at + 1020 V; the ions are accelerated by
      a grid (1), which is held at a potential of -2000
      V, and enter the field-free drift tube at zero
      potential (4).  These charged particles are sent by
      the electrostatic reflector (5) into the second
      drift tube (6) and on towards the detector (7).
      The ions trajectories are focused by the lenses
      (9), (10) and (11).  A set of three electrodes
      (12), consisting of an inner grid at +1000 V
      between two grids at zero potential, prevents ions
      with energies less than 1 keV from reaching the
      detector.  The geometry of the reflector is
      designed in such a way as to bunch ions of the same
      species (particles with energies E>E(0) travel a
      larger distance than those with energies E<E(0))
      and to eliminate those with energies that deviate
      too much from E(0).  The purpose of this mirror
      system is to reduce the dispersion of the flight
      times for particles having the same charge-to-mass
      ratios.  The reflector potential is switch- between
      1000 V and 1100 V every 30 s, in order to
      compensate for the higher energies of ions created
      by the impacts of larger particles.  The
      time-of-flight is measured with reference to three
      signals: the light flash recorded by the
      photomultiplier (3), the pulses detected by the
      target (M), and the accelerating grid (1).  The
      signals induced in these sensors, in the first lens
      (9), in the ejecta trap (8) and in the detector
      (7), which are illustrated qualitatively in Figure
      8c, are used to characterize the mass of the
      particles.  Additional information about PUMA is
      given in the table below.
