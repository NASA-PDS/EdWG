            The main goals of the NEAR Multi-Spectral Imager (MSI) were to determine the shape 
            of Eros and to map the mineralogy and morphology of features on its surface at high 
            spatial resolution. MSI was a 537 x 244 pixel charge-coupled device camera with 
            five-element radiation-hardened refractive optics. It covered the spectral range from 
            0.4 to 1.1 microns, and it had an eight-position filter wheel. Seven narrow-band 
            filters were chosen to discriminate the major iron-bearing silicates present (olivine        
            and pyroxene); the eight, broad-band filter was for fast exposures and high sensitivity, 
            including optical navigation.  The camera had an FOV of 2.93 x 2.26 degrees and a pixel 
            resolution of 96 x 162 microrad. It had a maximum framing rate of 1 per second with 
            images digitized to 12 bits and a dedicated digital processing unit with an image buffer          
            in addition to both lossless and lossy on-board image compression.
