 
The spacecraft design is simple. CONTOUR has few articulated mechanisms; the
solar array is body mounted and does not require drive motors. The mission
geometry allows CONTOUR to use fixed, passive, existing antenna designs. With
the exception of along-track pointing of CRISP,all instrument pointing and
antenna pointing is controlled by moving the spacecraft. A dust shield made
of Nextel and Kelvar protects against impacts for the dust sizes and
densities expected at the three encounters.

The core of the CONTOUR imaging and spectral mapping experiments is the
CRISP. It will have a target tracking capability to ensure that the key
high-resolution frames are obtained. The instrument payload also includes
CFI, a simple wide-angle camera to serve as backup and provide global views
of the nucleus and coma.
 
The mass spectrometer, NGIMS, and dust analyzer, CIDA, will be mounted to
look in the direction of flight at closest approach. NGIMS will be provided
by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. It will be placed on the spacecraft
within the dust shield as far forward as possible to minimize contamination
from spacecraft impact debris. The CIDA will be a significantly improved
version of instruments that were flown successfully on Vega and Giotto during
the Halley encounters.
