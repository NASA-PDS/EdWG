    Instrument Description
    ======================
      Each Viking Orbiter was equipped with two identical vidicon
      cameras.  The camera system is commonly called the Visual
      Imaging Subsystem (VIS).  Each camera consists of a telescope,
      a slow scan vidicon, a filter wheel, and associated
      electronics.  The filter wheel contains blue, minus blue,
      violet, clear, green, and red filters.  The angular field of
      view as defined by the reseau pattern is 1.51 by 1.69 degrees.
      Since the scan lines go beyond the reseau pattern in the line
      direction the active field of view is about 1.54 degrees in
      this direction.  The actual ground area covered by an image
      varies as a function of spacecraft altitude and emission angle.
      The digital image is generated by scanning the vidicon face
      plate.  The signal is digitized as a 7-bit number.  The image
      contains 1056 horizontal lines.  There are 1182 samples in each
      line exposed to incoming light.  The vidicon samples 11 pixels
      on either side of the raster onto an opaque mask located at the
      front of each vidicon.  Hence, 1204 samples per line are
      telemetered to Earth, but only 1182 contain information.  Each
      camera can be commanded to acquire an image every 8.96 seconds.
      By alternating cameras, an image can be taken every 4.48
      seconds.
 
 
    Science Objectives
    ==================
      The first objective of the imaging system was to characterize
      potential landing sites in support of site selection.
      Additional objectives of the imaging system were to study the
      photometric and colorimetric properties of the surface
      discovered by Mariner 9 in order to better understand the
      geological history of Mars atmosphere.
 
 
    Operational Considerations
    ==========================
      Each Viking Orbiter camera contained a filter wheel with five
      filters and a clear position, i.e., no filter.  An image could
      be acquired using one of the six filters types, which included
      blue, minus blue, violet, clear, green, and red.  The filter
      wheel could be stepped only one position between each exposure.
      Three mode parameters or camera states could be set for a given
      exposure.  There was the light flood condition flag.  Light
      flooding was used to reduce the residual image from the
      previous exposure.  Eight small incandescent bulbs exposed the
      vidicon beyond saturation.  There were also two gain states:
      low and high.  The high gain state increased the gain by a
      factor of 2.  There was also an exposure offset that would
      provide a positive signal (DN) from the camera even for a zero
      exposure.
 
 
    Calibration Description
    =======================
      The radiometric calibration converts the digitized signal
      received from the camera (DN value) into a quantity that is
      proportional to the radiance reaching the sensor.  The
      sensitivity of the vidicon varies across the field of view.
      The sensitivity of the vidicon also varies with time.  Each
      Viking Orbiter imaging instrument was calibrated before flight.
      In addition, changes in the calibration over time have been
      estimated from analyses of images of deep space and dust
      storms.  The radiometric calibration applies additive and
      multiplicative corrections that account for the varying
      sensitivity of the vidicon.  The resulting values are
      proportional to radiance factor, which is defined as the ratio
      of the observed radiance to the radiance of a normally
      illuminated lambertian reflector of unit reflectance at the
      same heliocentric distance.  The geometric calibration removes
      electronic distortions and transforms the point perspective
      geometry of the original image into a map projection.  The
      electronic distortions are barrel- shaped distortions from the
      electron beam readout and complex distortions from interactions
      between the charge on the vidicon face plate and the electron
      beam.  The electronic distortions are modeled by comparing the
      undistorted locations of reseau marks with the actual locations
      in an image.
