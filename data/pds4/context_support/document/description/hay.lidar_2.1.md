The HAYABUSA spacecraft included a LIght Detection and Ranging  (LIDAR) altimeter. 
            The primary objective of LIDAR was to establish  the range between the HAYABUSA spacecraft and the asteroid Itokawa  
            for navigation purposes during the surveying and collection phases  of the mission.
