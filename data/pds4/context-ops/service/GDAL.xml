        <system_requirements_note>Software applications which support the GDAL library may also include support for the more than 100 included formats. 
            Support includes includes the planet definition, map projection parameters, and some label intricacies like pixel offset and multiplier. A few popular applications 
            with GDAL support include QGIS, Esri's ArcGIS Pro, TuiView, GRASS GIS, SAGA, UDIG, Socet GXP, Generic Mapping Tools (GMT), University of Minnesota's (UMN) MapServer, etc. 
            For applications that do not use GDAL, the bundle routines released with GDAL (e.g. gdal_translate, gdalwarp, ogr2ogr) can be used to convert the supported 
            planetary formats into many other geospatial formats (e.g. GeoTIFF, GeoJPEG2000, HDF4/5, CDF, ENVI, etc.). Support for conversion of GIS vector files 
            (e.g. shapefiles, GeoPackage, PDS4 GeoCSV, and many SQL engines like PostGRES/POSTGIS) and tables was recently added. Builds are available on most platforms including mobile, but 
            a recommended environment is Miniforge (once Miniforge is available, install GDAL tools using "conda install gdal" )</system_requirements_note>
        <description>GDAL is a translator library for raster geospatial data formats that is released under an X/MIT style Open Source license by the 
            Open Source Geospatial Foundation. As a library, it presents a single abstract data model to the calling application 
            for all supported formats. It also comes with a variety of useful command-line utilities for data translation and processing. It has support to read (and oftern write) most derived (map projected) 
            PDS3, PDS4 (raster, GIS vector, and tables), ISIS2, ISIS3+, and VICAR formats. It also supports FITS reading and writing using the CFITSIO library, 
            including an extension to FITS for geospatial definitions informally called GeoFITS. For more see; PDS3: https://gdal.org/drivers/raster/pds.html PDS4: https://gdal.org/drivers/raster/pds4.html
