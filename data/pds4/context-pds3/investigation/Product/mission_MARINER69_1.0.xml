    Mission Overview
    ================
      The mission was designed to have two spacecraft encounter Mars
      within a 5 day period, with TV images sent to Earth beginning
      2-3 days before closest approach.  Analysis of Mariner 6 data
      was required in time to reprogram Mariner 7.  Mariner 6 was
      targeted for a nearly equatorial flyby, with Mariner 7 taking a
      southerly route to enhance viewing of the south polar cap.  All
      original plans for data return volume were exceeded by
      substantial margins.  Refer to NASA SP-225 and other references
      for more information.  Mission start date given is for
      authorization given to JPL to proceed with the project.
 
 
    Mission Phases
    ==============
 
      MARINER 6 MARS ENCOUNTER
      ------------------------
        The encounter phase for Mariner 6 began with pointing of the
        scan platform at Mars, so that the planet sensor could track
        Mars for the narrow-angle TV camera.  All science instruments
        except the infrared spectrometer were activated at this time.
        Picture acquisition began 2 hours later.  The IR spectrometer
        filter motor and cooler were started at 35 min.  before
        closest approach.  The second Mars tracker viewed the Mars
        limb at -15 min., at 05:03 GMT July 31, starting the analog
        and digital tape recorders.  After closest approach, data
        playback continued for several days.

        Mission Phase Stop Time        : 1969-07-31
        Spacecraft Operations Type     : FLYBY
 
 
      MARINER 7 MARS ENCOUNTER
      ------------------------
        The encounter phase for Mariner 7 began with pointing of the
        scan platform at Mars, so that the planet sensor could track
        Mars for the narrow-angle TV camera.  All science instruments
        except the infrared spectrometer were activated at this time.
        After closest approach, data playback continued for several
        days.  The spacecraft returned to cruise mode for engineering
        tests, communications performance test, and science operations
        including star photography and scans by the UV spectrometer of
        the Milky Way and an area containing comet 1969-B.

        Target Name                    : MARS

        Mission Phase Stop Time        : 1969-07-31

    The Mariner Mars 1969 mission was undertaken to enhance
    man&apos;s knowledge of the surface and atmosphere of Mars and
    to provide a firm basis for an imaginative, long-range
    program of Martian exploration. The two flights were
    authorized after the successful 1964-65 flight of Mariner 4
    and the cancellation of the Voyager Mars Landing Program.
