                A description of the 2008 revised solution for the International Terrestrial 
                Reference Frame. ITRF2008 is based on reprocessed solutions of the four space 
                geodetic techniques: VLBI, SLR, GPS and DORIS, spanning 29, 26, 12.5 and 16 
                years of observations, respectively. The input data were time series (weekly 
                from satellite techniques and 24-h sessions from VLBI) of station positions 
                and daily Earth Orientation Parameters (EOPs). Considering the level of scale 
                consistency between VLBI and SLR, the ITRF2008 scale accuracy is evaluated to
                be at the level of 1.2 ppb (8 mm at the equator) over the common time-span of 
                the observations of both techniques. Although the performance of the ITRF2008
                is demonstrated to be higher than ITRF2005, future ITRF improvement resides in
                improving the consistency between local ties in co-location sites and space 
                geodesy estimates.

    <description>Geodesy is the scientific field focused on accurately measuring and understanding the Earth's shape, orientation, and gravity. Pythagoras and Eratosthenes made early contributions, with Pythagoras suggesting a spherical Earth and Eratosthenes estimating its circumference. Modern understanding recognizes that the Earth's shape is influenced by various forces, including gravity, rotation, tides, plate tectonics, volcanism, and fluid motion. These factors are continually measured and modeled for historical analysis and predictions.</description>
