            The VIPER mission, short for Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover, 
            is a NASA initiative designed to explore the Moon's south pole. This robotic 
            rover aims to locate and analyze water ice and other resources trapped in the 
            lunar soil. By studying these materials, VIPER plans to help scientists understand 
            the distribution, composition, and accessibility of lunar resources, which could 
            support future human exploration. VIPER will operate in some of the coldest and 
            darkest regions of the Moon, known as permanently shadowed craters, where water
            ice has been preserved for billions of years. The rover is about the
            size of a golf cart and is designed to traverse several miles during its 
            original 100-day mission.
            
            The VIPER mission faced delays due to a combination of factors, including the need 
            for additional preflight testing and supply chain challenges. Initially planned for 
            a late 2023 launch, the mission was postponed to late 2024 to allow more time for 
            testing the Astrobotic Griffin lander, which was to carry the rover. However, further 
            delays pushed the readiness date to September 2025. NASA ultimately decided to cancel 
            the mission in 2024, citing potential risks to other lunar exploration programs.
