    <description>The Canadian Light Source (CLS) Facility is located at the University of Saskatoon in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. The CLS has a third-generation 2.9 GeV storage ring, and the building occupies a footprint the size of a football field. It opened in 2004 after a 30-year campaign by the Canadian scientific community to establish a synchrotron radiation facility in Canada. As a national synchrotron facility with over 1000 individual users, it hosts scientists from all regions of Canada and around 20 other countries. Research at the CLS has ranged from viruses to superconductors to dinosaurs, and it has also been noted for its industrial science and its high school education programs. The injection system consists of a 250 MeV LINAC, a low energy transfer line, a 2.9 GeV booster synchrotron and a high energy transfer line. The CLS is the smallest of the newer synchrotron facilities, which results in a relatively high horizontal beam emittance of 18.2 nm-rad. The CLS was also one of the first facilities to chicane two undulators in one straight section, to maximize the number of insertion device beamlines. Longer term development of the facility includes the replacement of two of the phase I undulators with elliptically polarizing devices.
