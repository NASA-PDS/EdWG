    <description>The Lunar Prospector Spacecraft Alpha Particle Spectrometer (APS) consisted of five pairs of 3 cm by 3 cm square ion-implant silicon detectors, each pair placed on one face of a cube. They were covered by thin, Al-coated polypropylene foils to exclude sunlight. The sensors had a spectral resolution of about 100 KeV at 5.5 MeV. The combined field-of-view for the 5 sensor pairs was nearly 3-pi steradians, with the only blind spot being in the direction of the spacecraft bus. The APS had a mass of 4 kg and used about 7 w of power. A major science objective of the Alpha Particle Spectrometer was to measure the number and distribution of transient lunar outgassing events and their role as sources of the tenuous lunar atmosphere. The experiment investigated possible correlations of outgassing events with locations of young impact craters and tectonic features. The APS was mounted on one of the three Lunar Prospector booms. The Alpha Particle Spectrometer was mounted on a chassis that was shared with the Neutron Spectrometer. The APS searched for gas release events by detecting alpha particles produced by the decay of gaseous Rn-222 and solid Po-210. The Alpha Particle Spectrometer was designed to operate continuously during the Lunar Prospector Primary Mission.</description>
