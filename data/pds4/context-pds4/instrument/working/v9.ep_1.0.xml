The Energetic Particles experiment on Venera 9 was a Soviet KS-18-5M suite of
particle detectors. The experiment was designed as a monitor of charged
particles (proton and electron flux) of medium energies in interplanetary
space during cruise and at Venus from orbit around the planet. The KS-18-5M
suite comprised six sensors: an STS-5 gas-discharge (Geiger-Mueller) counter
(D1), three solid state detectors (D2, D4, D5), a windowed SBT-9 gas discharge
counter (D6), and a Cherenkov counter (D3). Spacecraft memory was used for
data storage, time resolution was about four hours. The instrument operated
and returned data from 9 June 1975, right after launch, until 11 January 1976,
after almost three months in orbit around Venus.

Sensor D1 was an STS-5 series gas discharge counter. It was a 1 cm diameter,
9 cm long tube mounted inside the wall of the spacecraft. The wall provided
minimal shielding (~1 g/cm**2 aluminum) for particles coming from the
direction of the Sun (geometric factor 13 cm**2 sr), giving a threshold of
proton energy of >30 MeV and electron energy of >2 MeV. For protons coming
from directions other than the Sun, the body of the spacecraft provided
shielding requiring an energy threshold of 500 MeV. These particles had
a geometric factor of 54 cm**2 sr. The flux intensity in particles per second
was measured continuously for all species.

Sensor D2 was a solid state detector (SSD) comprising a 400 micron thick plate
of silicon covered by thin foil and placed under a collimator with a hole in
the shape of a cone, and a pulse-amplitude analyzer. It was designed to
measure the flux of protons from within 30 degrees of the anti-Sun direction
with a geometric factor of 0.2 cm**2 sr. It could measure protons in the
energy range from 4 to 12 MeV with an angular precision of approximately
10 degrees. The sensor measured flux in particles per second continuously.

Sensor D3 was a Cherenkov detector consisting of a 30 x 30 mm plexiglass
cylinder and a photomultiplier. It was designed to measure protons of energy
greater than 800 MeV and electrons greater than 10 MeV from all directions
with a geometric factor 30 cm**2 sr. It measured flux in particles per second
continuously.

Sensor D4 was an SSD comprising a 30 micron thick plate of silicon covered by
thin foil and placed under a collimator with a hole in the shape of a cone,
and a pulse-amplitude analyzer. It was designed to measure the flux of protons
from the sunward direction with an energy range from 1 to 5 MeV. The sensor
measured flux in particles per second continuously, but the data returned from
this detector were not usable.

Sensor D5 was an SSD comprising a 30 micron thick plate of silicon covered by
thin foil and placed under a collimator with a hole in the shape of a cone,
and a pulse-amplitude analyzer. It was designed to measure the flux of protons
from the anti-sunward direction with an energy range from 0.3 to 5 MeV. The
sensor measured flux in particles per second continuously, but the data
returned from this detector were not usable.

Sensor D6 was a windowed gas discharge detector of the SBT-9 series, designed
to measure protons of energy greater than 1 MeV and electrons greater than
0.05 MeV. The data returned from this detector were not usable.

The Principal Investigator for this experiment was Dr. Eugene Ya. Volodin of
Moscow State University.
