    <description>The radio system is composed primarily of an ultrastable oscillator (1 part in 10**12), a ground-based transmitter and receiver, a spacecraft transmitter and receiver, and antennae. The radio signal (approximately 2200 MHz) is transmitted from one of the three Deep Space Station antennae (Goldstone California; Madrid, Spain; or Canberra, Australia) and then received at the spacecraft.  The signal is immediately re-transmitted (there is a multiplication by 240/221 to prevent feedback into the spacecraft receiver loop) and then received at earth, where it is differenced with the originally transmitted signal.
The difference in frequency (the Doppler shift) can be measured to less than 0.01 Hz S band (about 0.65 mm/s) for a 5-second averaging time.  However, there are error sources which frequently degrade this accuracy.  Such things as the earth's troposphere and ionosphere, the Venus atmosphere, and space plasma cause the data noise level to increase by several factors.  The noise levels were very dynamic and changed significantly from day to day.  In some cases where solar conjunction was approaching, the noise increased by a factor of 10 or more and made the data unusable.  The data are displayed as residuals which were obtained by differencing the raw observation with the theoretical calculation.</description>
