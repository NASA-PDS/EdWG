            The Radio wave Observation at the Lunar Surface of the photoElectron Sheath (ROLSES) instrument has four 2.5 m monopole antennae for detecting the electric field signals. The signals at a sampling rate of 120 M samples per second are fed into Digital Signal Processors (DSP) for spectral analysis. Each antenna has its own dedicated DSP where the signals are processed into spectra for both low (~0.003 to ~1.9 MHz) and high (~0.06 to ~30 MHz) frequency bands of 512 frequency channels each. The cadence of both bands from all 4 antennae (8 spectra) is 8 seconds, with the low band and high band staggered by 4 seconds. No cross correlation is made between DSPs so only the absolute values of the FFT amplitudes are telemetered. ROLSES also has the capability of running in the raw capture mode which captures, simultaneously, 4,096 samples at 120 M samples per second for each of the 4 antennas. The raw capture mode, with the DSP’s held in standby, is intended for test and dust detection, was exercised during the mission. The tipping over of the lunar lander led to the severe power, telemetry constraints, and non-optimal deployment of the ROLSES' antenna. The limited telemetry and power did not allow for the investigation of the effects of changing the ROLSES’ gain settings. Due to these limitations ROLSES collected just a small fraction (1 to 2%) of the planned data volume.
