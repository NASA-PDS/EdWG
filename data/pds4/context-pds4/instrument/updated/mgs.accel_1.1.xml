    <description>An accelerometer is an instrument that measures the acceleration of the case of the sensor due to external forces. All accelerometers have a 'proof mass' and it is the tendency of the proof mass to move relative to the case that is a measure of the acceleration of the case. Early accelerometers produced output that was directly related to acceleration; but modern sensors integrate the internally measured signal, to reduce noise, and the output is proportional to the change in velocity over the integration time. In high precision accelerometers, like those on MGS, the proof mass is an electronically floating magnetic body. The electromagnetic field is varied to keep the proof mass stationary relative to the case. The voltage required to accomplish this is proportional to the acceleration. The accelerometers on MGS are sensitive to acceleration of the center of mass (c.m.) of the s/c, pseudo-accelerations (i.e., centrifugal) due to rigid motion of the s/c about the c.m., and differences in gravitational force at the proof mass and the c.m. of the s/c (gravity gradient). The MGS Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) contains four accelerometers. The principal accelerometer used in the aerobraking analysis is the z-axis accelerometer. This accelerometer is located at approximately (-0.44, -0.38, 0.72) m relative to the center of mass. The accelerometers are Sundstrand QA1200-AA08 model Q-Flex and continuously integrate acceleration to obtain velocity data. The instrument is sampled every 0.1 seconds. The data are recorded in instrument counts or quantized velocity increments equivalent to 0.332 mm/s per count. The QA1200 bias has a specified temperature sensitivity of 10 mg/K or approximately 0.3 counts/K. The temperature of the IMU assembly is actively controlled. IMU telemetered temperatures are quantized at 0.12 K and typical changes during an entire aerobraking pass are between two quantized values. Consequently, only a single, constant bias is determined for each pass through the atmosphere.</description>
