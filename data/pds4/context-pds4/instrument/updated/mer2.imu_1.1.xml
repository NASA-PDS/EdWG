    <description>Each MER entry capsule contained two LITTON LN-200S Inertial Measurement Units (IMU).  One IMU was located within the rover, with the other IMU located on the backshell.  The IMU within the rover was not located at the rover's center of mass, and the IMU within the backshell was not located at the backshell's center of mass.  Neither of the two IMU's within the entry capsule was located near either the entry shell's center of mass nor the entry shell's spin axis.  The entry shell consisted of the heat shield and backshell inside of these two joined components. The four LN-200S units employed in the mission were selected from a larger population for improved stability. These LN-200S IMU's provide three-axis rotation rate and acceleration measurements.  The rotation rate is provided by a Fiber Optic Gyro (FOG) sensor, while the accelerations are provided by silicon accelerometers.  Each IMU contains three FOGs and three accelerometers, oriented orthogonally to provide measurements in three dimensions simultaneously.  The resultant measurements from each of the accelerometers and each of the FOGs is spatially transformed to the center of the IMU prior to being output by the instrument. Each IMU has a mass of 0.75 kg (1.65 pound weight), is ~9 cm by 9 cm in size, and is operated at 12 watts.  These LN-200S IMU's have space flight heritage, having been successfully flown on the Clementine mission. The accelerometers within each IMU had a dynamic range of 80g (where g here represents Earth's standard surface gravitational acceleration of 9.80665 meters per second per second) and a resolution of 2.4 milli g's, with a noise level of 1.6 milli g's when sampled at 400 Hz (the nominal instrument sampling rate). The spacecraft could not handle 400 Hz sampling, so the IMU data were summed over 50 measurements, resulting in an 8 Hz sampling by the spacecraft.  This summing has the effect of reducing the the effective noise to 300 micro g's, with an effective resolution of 50 micro g's. Atmospheric entry occurred at a nominal height of 128 km above the Mars surface at a nominal atmospheric relative velocity of 5400 m/s.  The frictional drag of the atmosphere upon the entry vehicle results in a reduction in the speed of the entry vehicle. This deceleration is measured by the accelerometers within the IMU, while the orientation of the entry vehicle is provided by the gyroscope measurements. The FOGs also provided relative orientation information for both the backshell and the lander after parachute deployment, which occurred approximately 240 seconds after entry at an altitude approximately 8.5 kilometers above the surface.  The lander separated from the backshell and descended on a tether approximately 30 seconds after parachute deployment.  Subsequent simultaneous backshell and lander (rover) IMU measurements in this tethered condition allow for the 'swing' of the lander on the tether to be determined.  This enabled removal of this motion from the accelerometer measurements, permitting a determination of the net motion of the lander toward the surface.  This allows for atmospheric profile reconstruction while the lander is still attached to the parachute.  These measurements (as well as the descent imaging) also served as part of the guidance for the horizontal motion reduction system which was included to minimize lander horizontal motion upon initial impact with the surface. The bridle connecting the lander to the backshell was severed approximately three seconds prior to surface impact.  The backshell IMU measurements ceased upon the severing of this connection.</description>
