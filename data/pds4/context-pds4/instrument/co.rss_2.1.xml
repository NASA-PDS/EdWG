                    Updated for Cassini Orbiter raw radio science data migration to PDS4.
                    Separated ground elements into a separate set of context products; this
                    context product describes only the spacecraft instrumentation.  Corrected
                    instrument type to be 'Radio Science'.  Reformatted for easier reading.

                   The Cassini Radio Science Team paper, published as the Cassini Orbiter began its
                   science observations within the Saturn system. Radio science investigations began
                   during the cruise phase of the mission and included searches for gravitational 
                   waves and solar conjunction observations. During the Saturnian Tour, atmospheric, 
                   ionospheric, ring, and satellite occultations were observed, and determinations
                   of masses and gravity fields were extracted from radio tracking data. New 
                   technologies in the construction of the instrument, which consisted of a portion 
                   on-board the spacecraft and another portion on the ground, were described in the
                   paper.  These included the use of a Ka-band signal, in addition to those 
                   at S- and X-bands, opening new opportunities for important discoveries in each
                   of the above scientific areas due to increased accuracy, resolution, sensitivity,
                   and dynamic range.

    <description>The Radio Science investigations on Cassini were unique in that they utilized instrumentation with elements both on the spacecraft and on the ground.  The spacecraft element was further distinguished in being distributed among several subsystems on the Cassini Orbiter.  Cassini Radio Science can be regarded as a solar-system-sized instrument observing at microwave frequencies, with one end of the radio path on the spacecraft and the other end at the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) stations on the ground.</description>
