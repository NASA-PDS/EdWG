Notes from context clean-up activities
======================================

Missing <reference_type> values
-------------------------------

Context: Product_Context/Reference_List/Internal_Reference
    investigation_to_agency
    investigation_to_investigation (for large observing campaigns with 
        separately organized groups working independently, and for 
        legacy extended missions that do not have multiple mission
        names in the data or references). 

Context: Product_*/Identification_Area/Licensing/Internal_Reference
    ??? The DPH description and implementation here is seriously problematic. 
         PDS should absolutely not be creating its own URI for licenses 
         that have public, well-supported URIs, or implying that it will
         somehow be independently versioning these licenses. It also
         separates any license and CC0 from its legal definition. This 
         DEFEATS usability. Also, CCO is NOT a license and the language 
         in the DPH repeatedly describing it as such is just flat-out 
         wrong.
         
         
         
Questions
=========

Telescopes
----------
    
  o For portable telescopes, should there be a "facility" product
    created to identify the owner of the portable telescope for 
    inclusion in the investigation reference list?
    
Missions
--------

  o Should extended missions link to all precursor missions or only
    the immediate precursor? Should there be a special <reference_type>
    for this?
    
  o Should primary missions link to all extended missions, or only
    the immediate successor mission? Should there be a special
    <reference_type> for this?
    
  o When one mission is designed specifically to observe the 
    aftermath of a completely separate mission, should these
    mission context products reference each other? If so, should
    there be a special <reference_type> for this case?
