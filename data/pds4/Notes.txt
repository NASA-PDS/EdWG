Notes from context clean-up activities
======================================

Missing <reference_type> values
-------------------------------

Context: Product_Context/Reference_List/Internal_Reference
    investigation_to_agency
    investigation_to_investigation (for large observing campaigns with 
        separately organized groups working independently, and for 
        legacy extended missions that do not have multiple mission
        names in the data or references). 

Context: Product_*/Identification_Area/Licensing/Internal_Reference
    ??? The DPH description and implementation here is seriously problematic. 
         PDS should absolutely not be creating its own URI for licenses 
         that have public, well-supported URIs, or implying that it will
         somehow be independently versioning these licenses. It also
         separates any license and CC0 from its legal definition. This 
         DEFEATS usability. Also, CCO is NOT a license and the language 
         in the DPH repeatedly describing it as such is just flat-out 
         wrong.
         
         
         
Questions
=========

General
-------
  o What should we do about "To Do" lists in the investigation context 
    objects? I'm finding these for legacy data that is not going to be
    migrated any time soon, and resolving them ultimately requires 
    working up and down the reference chain. Are we expected to do that
    now? Later? If not now, what is the point of carrying comments in 
    the context object as opposed to, say, an errata file or something 
    that might be visible to a user interested in the investigation?
    
  o 256 characters seems ridiculously short for a "description" field. 
    It's only one character longer than the "title" field. If the 
    intention is to enforce it, then it needs to be schematically 
    enforced or it will be ignored. I suggest it would be more useful
    to describe how to write a description, and only display the 
    first 80-256 characters unless a user requests to see more.
    
Telescopes
----------
    
  o For portable telescopes, should there be a "facility" product
    created to identify the owner of the portable telescope for 
    inclusion in the investigation reference list?
    
Missions
--------

  o Should extended missions link to all precursor missions or only
    the immediate precursor? Should there be a special <reference_type>
    for this?
    
  o Should primary missions link to all extended missions, or only
    the immediate successor mission? Should there be a special
    <reference_type> for this?
    
  o When one mission is designed specifically to observe the 
    aftermath of a completely separate mission, should these
    mission context products reference each other? If so, should
    there be a special <reference_type> for this case?
