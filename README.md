# NASA PDS Software Working Group
The PDS Software Working Group is a subcommittee of the PDS Management Council (MC). Its purpose is to identify and coordinate tool development needs and priorities across the PDS.

The Software WG identifies, prioritizes, and recommends the development of tools to the Management Council. This includes tools developed across PDS nodes. It also monitors tool development by IPDA members.

The scope of the work required can be grouped into two categories:
* PDS Integrated Task Planning is an effort to develop and maintain a plan of all current and future software development tasks across all the PDS nodes.
* Software Change Control Board is a formalized approach for EN to appropriately re-prioritize and scope new tasks into current and future build cycles based upon Discipline Node input.

See the website for more details.
